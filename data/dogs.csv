I was with my GSD in the parking garage of my building after coming in from a walk. An elderly couple were getting out of their car across from the elevator while another woman was getting out with her little 8-ish pound dog. 

My dog barked, didn’t growl. The dog woman didn’t run away, she just laughed a little and said goodbye while she went outside. 

The woman from the couple twisted her face up and told me not to hold the door for her. We ended up getting out of separate elevators on the same floor. As I’m going in to my apartment I heard her bitching to her husband that big dogs shouldn’t be allowed in the building. 

First of all lady, you nothing about my big dog, or about me, so shut up. My dog was not aggressive. If he wanted to eat that dog he would have. His hackles were not up, his tail was loose and curved up, and his body was not tense. No aggression. He can’t talk so he barked. 

Second of all, golden retrievers are bigger than my dog, so you’re saying they shouldn’t be allowed here? Or are you just prejudiced against German Shepherds? Almost every small dog we meet here barks at my dog but no one ever corrects them or says they shouldn’t be allowed. 

So educate yourself, please, before you make any assumption from your obviously limited knowledge.

26)	Feel free to ask any questions below. There has been a few Bichons lately but I read that they are bad for being left alone, is this true? We do travel and was wondering how a dog will do in a hotel alone? The dog would be in the hotel for a few hours while we are at appointments or shopping since we can't leave it in the car. This would only be once or twice a year when everyone's schedule com flicks and no one is at home.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what they’re tules are, but its a bit unfair!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if I don’t feel that comfortable with big dogs around me, is it fine to lock myself in my private room and let he dogs stay outside, or vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

I (21M) currently live with my girlfriend (19F), we're both students, and she has a dog, we'll name her Nelly, and we live in an apartment together. I'm not terribly informed about dogs.

Nelly is a 11-ish year old Pug/Chihuahua/Jack Russel mix, and she's like 15 pounds. During thunderstorms, she will almost always pee and poop in the hallway of the apartment. Nelly will also run around and bark because of thunder, and even hurt herself, usually her paw, from jumping around a bunch, though she'll also respond like this if she hears motor scooters/motorcycles, lawnmowers, or thumps made by, say, hitting the wall, or someone in the apartment above us stomping around.

Also, if girlfriend leaves the apartment without walking Nelly in the morning when she hasn't pooped in a while (10+ hours?), or walking her only for a short time to pee, she'll poop in the hallway. Sometimes we'll leave Nelly in the room for 5 minutes doing something else, indenting to walk her when we get back, and she'll poop in the floor. Nelly will also refuse to be walked long enough to poop when it's raining

Girlfriend says that Nelly is ""crazy"" and she's tried everything in the past (think like 5+ years back) to keep Nelly from doing things like this, including those indoor pads, ""thundershirts,"" taking her to the vet (they gave her ""doggy antidepresents"" but they didn't work), putting her in the laundry room, and even if she was walked and pooped recently before a storm, Nelly will still poop in the hallway.

How do we get her to stop pooping/peeing inside, and potentially even have her behave better during storms? Thanks in advance!

so i have a 5yr old terrier girl who's about 1-2kg overweight. in small dogs that's a huge number. so im trying my best to get her walked more, buyin her fetch toys and buying healthier vegetables and fruits to be used on walks.

but my parents.. they care but they don't show it. ive told them what amount of food my dog should be eating and left the scales clearly on the table above her food bowl and beside her food tin but they just toss food in there. there's no routine, every time she gets fed after a walk and they have the audacity to feed her again later on??? i feed her 50g of food for each meal, equating to 150g a day leaving 30g out. it isn't that hard to measure 50g on a dang scale!!!

and then whenever i tell em ""hey she's ate already don't feed her"" they say that she only needs a tiny bit more and that i should stop being so cruel????? like what!!!! and then they complain at me for her not loosing weight.

right so i know I'll get beef for this but my dog is on bakers small dog. it's a bad brand i know yall. i don't know if i can change it. she used to be on harringtons but we changed as my parents and i thought small dog food would be better.
i can't get anything expensive, i dont even think my parents will change. my cat's on better food than my dog. if any of you guys have any news articles about the bad things about bakers please let me know as i really want to change her food. i can't stand having her eat the garbage that's goin in her. plus if any of yall are from the UK and there's a good, low calorie brand of dog food that's easy to get from an asda then please let me know!

before you hit me with responsibility and whatever, im 16 so i can't do much. i ain't got money or anything like that. i got to buy her a new harness and a new tag soon as my parents keep bugging me about it. i want to do as much as i can","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;heyo so im here again.&lt;/p&gt;

Background: I live in a house with a large backyard and have another adopted dog ( she has her issues too and will need a post also!). My pitbull (mixed with lab) Olive, she was bought by my sister at a really really young age. We tried to help train her, but my sister was stubborn and didn’t want our advice. We tried crate training her as a young pup but my sister and Olive hated it. Few months past by and she got bored of Olive and passed her to us.


I believe Olive was not introduced to enough dogs as a puppy and was taken too young from her mom. She does very very well with other dogs in public, but can sometimes get skiddish with some dogs. She is so friendly to people and doesn’t misbehave at all! Everyone loves her! She is so calm, sweet, and friendly


But at my mom’s house, she acts like the stereotypical pitbull. She gets so agressive towards almost everyone. She gets toy and food agressive. She plays way too rought with my older dog. She goes potty in our house even though she went outside multiple times. She knows how to be house trained and sometimes goes to the bathroom outside 

She thinks she can bark to get what she wants. she snarls and acts like shes gonna bite you when someoje pisses her off or at random times. She has never bit anyone except for some minor nibbling as a puppy. 


Olive is a puppy and yes, has a lot of energy, which I take her on a hike everyday and a walk. She gets very very tired and stops me when she’s done. I don’t think its her needing to relase energy. She has soo many toys, which she rips to shreds and has bones, which is the only way to keep her calm at home. She has calm moments at home, but very rare

She is fine at my sister’s house as she doesn’t pee or act agressive, but they use frowened upon methods to keep her in line.  

TLDR: my pitbull is amazing and well behaved literally anywhere outside my home. She is well loved, has long hikes and walks each day. She acts agressively out at home by barking excessively, snarling,  etc. and goes pee in our house :/. I just want her to stop acting so agressively excited at my house and stop going potty inside. 

Any advice is welcome; We had to take her back to my sisters because my neighbors complained about her barking and we rent our house :(. I want to take her back as my sister and her boyfriend are literally the worst pet owners. I can’t afford training so thats off tje table.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for formating - on phone. &lt;/p&gt;

She was 3 years old when we adopted her in March 2016. Within about a month she developed a hot spot and skin infection. 

October 2016 she was tested for allergies and we found she has 38 allergens. We changed her food and started her on allergy shots but she still struggled with hot spots. We stopped using the shots by December. Since most of her allergens are environmental and we experience a deep winter, her skin improved a bit. 

Once spring came and things started blooming, her allergies and subsequent problems picked up again. In May 2017, she was put on Apoquel as her vet felt we exhausted every other option. 

Sophie stays on Apoquel from first bloom - first deep frost (about 8 months). She is on the lowest effective dose and keeps her from having any hot spots/infections. However, Apoquel hasn’t solved the dry skin problems. She is still flaky year round and her hair is starting to thin significantly. 

So, that leads me to my question! What remedies are godsends for dry skin?

We have tried:
* olive oil
* coconut oil
* fish oil (mackerel, anchovy, sardine—she is allergic to salmon)
* Bixbi powder
* SolidGold SeaMeal
* Vetoquinol Dermal Soothe spray
* Sojos Skin &amp; Coat
* Relief Spray
* NuPro Immunity Support powder
* Numerous shampoos and rinses

We will try literally anything, as long as she isn’t allergic to an ingredient! 

TL;DR- Looking for dry skin remedies for a highly sensitive dog.

I apologise, I am on mobile and new to this sub. I have looked all over the web but I have not been able to find a specific list of what constitutes as animal abuse. Also, I'm not sure where I should report it, if this is in fact animal abuse.
My best friend and her husband bought a German Shepherd puppy when she was 8 months pregnant against my advice. This puppy is now almost a year old (I'm horrible at math but I estimate he's 10 and a half months old now) and is obviously not puppy sized anymore. He spends the entire day in his kennel with a thick comforter laying over so that he can't see out (even when it's hot!) and no one can see in. He is also kenneled overnight. I estimate 20 out of 24 hours he's locked up. He is always panting from the heat and you can hear the clicking as he turns around on the bare plastic bin. He isn't allowed to come out unless her husband is home because she doesn't want to deal with him. It breaks my heart. Every time I visit he starts to whine and gets told to shut up. There are pee trails right outside their apartment. I'm inferring this is because he is locked up for so long he can't hold it to go down the steps. They are on the top floor. He has no training and the husband is overwhelmed because the dog just won't behave. Not that is the dog's fault. I have tried talking to her, talking to her husband and when I visit I take him out to potty, uncover his kennel and make sure he has water. What can I do to help him? I was taught if it feels wrong it's probably not right. What should I do? Who should I contact?

He wasn&amp;#39;t running after her but when she started screaming he thought she was playing with him (we play hunting that way ((running and screaming))) he was happy and wanted to play. I called him so he stopped and waited but the girl kept screaming and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw. My dog is trained. 
He wasn&amp;#39;t near her and if she wasn&amp;#39;t screaming he wouldn&amp;#39;t change direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m posting this because I wanted to ask what people think about this situation. And if that girl was wrong or I did something bad while training my dog.&lt;/p&gt;

There is also some venting, but advice is my main reason for posting. 

[Backstory] I grew up with dogs, mostly German Shepards, and my oldest dream was to have a dog of my own. Instead, I was chosen by the best cat ever! This cat, my soulmate cat, died a couple years ago and I was crushed. After a period of mourning, I decided to get a German Shepard, both fulfilling a childhood dream and avoiding the pitfall of getting a ""replacement"" for my cat. My fiance requested I get a puppy, fair, he has a cat and we were told the best way to protect the cat was to raise a puppy to be used to the cat. I've been down the puppy road before, so I know...I know.

[Meat of the Story] I had 3 rules for the dog, no bite playing (hand playing), no jumping(large breed, duh), and no human food except special occasions, in his bowl only, and after looking up if it's safe. I went all out, found a trusted breeder, found an amazing training class, learned about the right foods, and put him on my vet's puppy plan. This was expensive as well as a lot of work. My fiance put in quite a bit of money and work in as well, we both care for all the pets, but the ""owner"" makes the rules. 

The puppy is now a year old, and fiance has broken all 3 rules, at first, behind my back, then blatantly. I warned him over and over that he was going to regret it when the dog was full-grown, but I'm the only one who regrets it. He just dismissed my concerns because the dog is so well behaved in most other areas. As a result of the last year, a combination of fiance working at home and having more bonding time, me being mean mommy who enforced these 3 rules alone, and being physically overpowered by the dog, my dog and I have no connection anymore. He ignores me completely when daddy's around. When I say a command, he looks at daddy first to see if he has to listen more than half the time. 

I have told fiance on multiple occasions that I don't feel like he's my dog, fiance assures me the dog loves me more (not really what I'm concerned about, and not true). I finally found the words to express my feelings and told my fiance. I told him that I can't play with the dog because he jumps on me and bites me(I'm covered in bruises constantly, fiance is big and strong, doesn't affect him). I can't pet him because he wants to play bite me after a minute or so. This is a big dog who is constantly hurting me physically in an innocent, ""I'm a puppy,"" way. Fiance has assured me that he can fix these issues. He told me to give him a month to train the behaviors out of the dog. I'm skeptical, also, I believe that once the dog does these things, it's unlikely they can be trained out of it, I could be wrong though. 

This dog is crazy well behaved for his age, walks on a leash great, listens to me outside of the house, doesn't bite anyone but me and fiance, and we get compliments all the time about his behavior, so he's not a bad dog, he just thinks these behaviors are allowed. 

Fiance has his issues, but is a wonderful person, I don't think he realizes how much it hurts, I feel like my dog's heart was stolen when I was willing to share it with fiance. I realized, while I love my dog, I don't like him right now, it makes me feel like such an awful person, but it's my truth right now. I also feel angry that fiance, who never had a dog growing up, dismisses my experience and steamrolls my decisions. My dog is the perfect dog for my fiance now. 

[Advice] So, here are my questions. Is my fiance right that a year old puppy can be trained out of play biting, jumping, and begging after being allowed to for so long? How can I recreate a bond with this dog when he's large and I bruise easily? Would it be better for the dog if I just step back and let him have the relationship he wants with his chosen person? Am I right to be afraid that he could play bite a stranger someday? Do I even have a dog anymore? Am I being over-dramatic about this, seriously, I've been wondering? If fiance doesn't follow through with his promise, how can I successfully stop the dog from jumping and biting me?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is long and &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; heavy.

This is actually my girlfriend's dog,  but we do live together and I help a lot with his care.  He is almost 2, and is a lab / blue heeler mix.  He isn't neutered, but from everything I have read that doesn't help with aggressive behavior anyways.  I take him on a walk every morning and again on my lunch break.  We go for a longer walk / jog in the evening.

The past couple of months, he has been growing increasingly aggressive.  He bit my girlfriend and drew blood once, he snaps at me occasionally, and he will regularly snarl at us when we tell him to get off the kitchen counter or couch.  He mostly refuses to listen to commands unless we have treats, and he is leash reactive towards other people. 

He corned me in the kitchen today when I was reheating lunch after our walk.  He jumped up on the counter, so I did a sing-song ""get down buddy"" and he responded by snarling, baring his teeth, and lifting one paw up.  I backed off as much as I could until he walked away.

I have had a chipoo (Chihuahua poodle mix) for about a year, and this past Monday I just rescued a 3 month old Siberian Husky pup.

I don't know if I've been the best owner for Loki, my chipoo, but he seems happy and healthy-ish. No problems, he knows how to sit, lay down, stop doing something when I say ""no"" and what-not; but he doesn't eat a lot. He is skinny. Not so skinny I can see his ribs, but skinny enough that I am concerned about him. I feed him regularly but he just doesn't eat most of the time and it goes to waste. Generally only see him eat a whole meal if he goes a day or even two without eating at all. His poops are normal, no sign of worms. No other symptoms like lethargy or pain.

Kona, my new husky, seems to be adjusting well, but I'm also concerned about her. The first day I had her home she ate all three meals I gave her with gusto, finishing every last bite. But the second day she had an upset tummy, with liquid diarrhea and some vomiting. I did not change her diet from what her previous owner had been feeding her so I don't think it was anything she ate, but maybe she is stressed by being in a new place with a new dog (Loki is the first other dog she's been around). She was lethargic until about 9pm that night and then she perked up, stop having diarrhea and seemed fine. But she hasn't been eating since and this morning she had a diarrhea accident in my kitchen.

I've been keeping a very close eye on her to make sure she isn't getting into things she shouldn't. Loki gets into everything so I was already prepared to prevent her from doing the same, tho she is much better behaved than him. My kids did say she got into the cat litter box while I was at work the first night we had her, though. As of right now, she seems perfectly fine. She's been in the backyard running around or at my feet just chewing on a rawhide bone.

My dog Quinn injured her paw pad at doggie daycare yesterday and I'd like some advice on how to care for it/ if she needs to see a vet. They called me yesterday afternoon to tell me she'd scraped up her paw but said it didn't seem to be bothering her. She's kind of a wrecking ball with her play style, so I wasn't too worried about this.

However, when I picked her up she was moving super slow and clearly in pain. She didn't just scrape her paw, a whole section of the pad came off. When we got home she went to her crate and has stayed there except to pee and drink a little water. She clearly does not want to walk on it. I'm pissed for a few reasons and don't plan to take her back there (not a huge fan of these places anyway).

Last night it looked raw but pink, and I cleaned it with some antiseptic and left it alone. However this morning it [looks very red and angry](https://imgur.com/a/6WU3xYF) and she's still laying in the crate not wanting to walk. I brought her some water to the crate, and have applied some neosporin as well as a bootie to keep her from messing with it.

Questions are: is there anything else I should do to care for it? Does this require a vet visit?

FDA warns against feeding your dog grain-free!""

The TLDR to this is that's utter bullshit. Below will be a bit of a longer explanation to why it is bullshit and why, if you currently feed your dog grain-free (and especially if you always have and your dog has never eaten grains), you should continue to do so.

The very first article I personally read that was anti grain-free was stating anecdotal evidence of dogs dying of taurine deficiency and these dogs were all on ""boutique"" brand grain-free diets. The bullshit I am calling to this one is taurine is an amino acid literally only found in animal based proteins. Soooo, how would feeding your dog grains solve this problem?

Another big argument I'm seeing is grain-free is just a marketing scam and the foods are still low quality, low meat. I can agree with this one, but there is still missing facts from this. Yes, it is true that soy, wheat gluten, and corn are all used to falsely boost protein values in low quality food. Yes, it is true that grain-free foods will do the same thing using peas, chickpeas, and potatoes. What is being failed to be explained is protein biological value and digestibility. All protein sources have what's called a biological value. This basically is a number given to things based on how ""complete"" the protein is, meaning how many essential amino acids it has. Eggs are typically the baseline for this and have a value of 100. Here is a quick chart of some estimated values of protein sources for dogs. This chart is just a general estimation, as many articles and charts will have somewhat differing results, but it still gives a general idea.

[https://imgur.com/Ee26w1H](https://imgur.com/Ee26w1H)

Mixing various protein sources can increase their biological value if what you mixed fills in the amino acid gaps. So, why is vegetable based proteins still better than grain based if you can get bio values exceeding 100 with the right combo of grains? Because digestibility also matters. In humans, dogs, and cats, animal protein is easier to digest than plant protein. Cats actually almost entirely cannot digest any nutrition from plants and are technically obligate carnivores (meaning \~90% or more of their diet should be animal product). Dogs are not obligate carnivores, but they are still more carnivorous than humans and needs less plant matter than we do. Because of this, their protein digestibility goes animal&gt;vegetable&gt;grain.

So to conclude, yes, many manufacturers use vegetables to boost their low quality food protein value in the same exact way grains are used. But even if you food your dog a food that does that, the biological value and digestibility of the proteins found in the vegetables is still better than what is found in grains. At the end of the day whether you choose grain or grain-free, you should strive to find a brand of dog food that doesn't skimp on animal protein and gives your dog what they actually need. I choose to feed my dog grain-free since commercial foods that do provide actual sufficient animal protein is out of my budget, so I choose the next best thing. I also pick a dog food that's GA protein value is a bit higher than what a dog actually needs in a day to account for some of the available protein not being digestible.

If you have never fed your dog grains, continue to do so. You may induce allergies in your dog if you suddenly are feeding them soy or wheat gluten when they have never eaten those that may include indigestion, diarrhea, itchiness, and hair loss.

Final conclusion is I know we all wish we were rich enough to hire a personal chef for our dog and make them some grand homemade food that has absolutely everything they could ever wish for, but none of us have that kind of money. Just, don't let some buzz word stuffed articles scare you into suddenly switching your dog's diet if what you have been feeding your dog is keeping them at a healthy weight, healthy coat, and appropriate energy level.

Back story is that her friend came to visit and stay at this lady’s house with said dog for a few weeks and then left saying she’d come back after visiting other family. She didn’t come back and left the dog with this woman and said she could sell her or keep her. Apparently has been under this woman’s care for a few months.

The dog hasn’t been to the vet for her shots and is not fixed. The woman was asking for $500 but I asked if she could go lower as she isn’t spayed and hasn’t had a vet visit. The lady said the least she’ll do is $425 as she said the chihuahua is “purebred” and she wants to “make back what she’s put into the dog at least”. She felt it wasn’t her responsibility to bring the dog to the vet as she didn’t expect to have her for this long. Yet the pup has been around kids and other dogs.

The pup is really sweet, calm, and shy. Very friendly and I really liked her overall personality and she got no reaction from my reactive neutered maltese which is amazing and rare.

I’d love to buy her, but with her cost of $425, then getting shots (~$465) and eventual spay, I’d be spending close to $1000 and up right away. 

So is $425 for a dog with no shots, unfixed and is 4-5 months old too expensive for the value of the dog? Or is it okay?

I just adopted a 16 week old Aussie/Border Collie mix a a little under a month ago. Super smart, almost potty trained, can leave him off leash outside, and super mellow for such a high energy breed. The only problem is when I leave the apartment. He sleeps fine in his crate at night (crate is next to my bed) and doesn't make a sound when I go to the bathroom/bedroom and close the door, only when the actual apartment door opens/closes (has a distinct sound). I've heard a lot of people say even when they take showers, their puppies howl and bark because they can't see their owners. Additionally, I'll throw him a kong with PB in it before I leave and that is usually gone when I return, so I'm hoping that he's just a puppy and will grow out of the howling when alone phase.

Anyhow, when I leave the apartment for even 5 seconds and he's either in his crate, or roaming the apartment, he FREAKS out. If i'm leaving for work and don't come back until lunch, I'll most of the time find he eliminated either in his crate or in the apartment even though he went before I left for work (I let him roam the apartment one time for a test trial and that was a bad idea..blinds on windows were shredded, as well as poop and pee on the floor...but when I did get back, he was just chilling calmly on the couch). I recently did a test though to see how long he whined for and it was surprisingly only for around 15 minutes or so, again leading me to believe he's afraid and then he mellows out.

I think he it still adapting, but if it is the beginning of SA, I'd like to try and curb it before it gets any worse. Anyone have any thoughts on if this sounds more like puppy behavior and he will learn I will always come back? Or if this sounds like the start of SA?

Good morning. Apologies for any formatting issues.

This morning I was walking my dog on a leash with a prong collar. My neighbor’s three loose dogs charged us as we came around the corner. I attempted to pull my dog behind me but one of the dogs went directly for my dog. The fight lasted about three minutes, snapping, growing, biting. I did not attempt to break up the fight as it was 3 v 1. I did try to maneuver my dog away while still allowing her to defend herself. In the process I injured my arm and back and we were knocked in to a bird bath on another neighbor’s property that was damaged.

I was able to separate my dog and begin moving back towards my apartment. We were followed by these three dogs, one of which tried to again attack my dog and get in to my apartment. I shoved my dog inside and stayed outside with the dogs. My immediate neighbor witnessed part of the event and said he did not know whose dogs they were.

I followed the dogs to the top of the street and took video of them running down the road nearly ¼ mile away from their home. Several minutes elapsed and I took further video of them running in to the street, rifling through people’s garbage and running loose. I know who the owner is. Since I moved in about a month ago he has repeatedly opened his door and allowed his dogs to roam free while I assume he gets ready for work. Then he comes out with a leash and calls them and moves them back inside. When he came out I was too upset to not confront him. He apologized and asked if his dogs attacked my dog to which I replied yes. He asked if I my dog got bit and I said yes. He apologized and said that his dogs escape from a hole in the fence which is a lie. I’ve witnessed him open his door and allow his dogs to leave. There is a neighbor who leaves bread out for the birds and when the neighbor lets his dogs out, he yells “get that bread.”

I am furious, shaken up and hurt. Initial assessment is that my dog is not injured but this was a quick once over. I work in medicine and absolutely had to be at the hospital. My dog walker is a vet tech who is going by this afternoon and is going to really check her out for wounds. We have a vet appointment this evening. I do not believe I should have to pay for a vet visit nor should I have to pay to replace the bird bath on my neighbor’s property. This person DOES have a fenced yard. We live in a very urban city, so I HAVE to walk my dog. I do everything in my power to control him as he is leash reactive and I use a prong collar.

I have alerted animal control but is there anything else I can or should do? I was going to leave a note on his door saying I’d like to avoid going to court and this is the cost of my vet visit and you can check with the other neighbor about his bird bath. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

If it’s relevant my dog is a Belgian Malinois and two of the dogs were labs and one appears to be a lab/terrier mix. My dog is in my post history.

Long post:

I am on an extended trip across the country so brought my dog (Peach) with me. She is a rescue and has mostly bonded to me so it is very stressful for her when I leave for vacations and such. She has come a long way in terms of fear since I adopted her &gt;1 year ago but is still quite shy. We are currently staying at my mom’s on this trip.


The first 2 days here were great, we walked around the neighbourhood, went for trail walks, she ran around in the dog park. 


My mom’s dog (Sushi) has fear issues where he refuses to walk around the neighbourhood because of fireworks going off recently (before we arrived), but he would walk if we drive to a trail somewhere. Now Peach is also reluctant to go for walks around the neighbourhood. This further escalated yesterday to both dogs refusing to go for trail walks. They’ll be happy to put on their harnesses and get in the car, but as soon as we get out to where the trail starts they refuse to move further and pull to go back to the car. Peach is even reluctant to go in the backyard. I don’t know if something scared her or they are feeding off each other’s fear and Peach is generalizing it to all of outside being scary. 


She was able to go walk around the block this morning (without Sushi) but did not stop to sniff or go to the bathroom and got scared when she heard a loud car. 
Back home, she loved sniffing around on walks and wouldn’t really be phased by sounds while walking. In fact I think she was able to come out of her shell when I first adopted her because we went for so many walks (I live in an apartment). 

For reference my mom has a house in the suburbs. Peach is a mutt of unknown breeds (the rescue thinks Japanese spitz mix) and Sushi is a border collie, both rescued but different circumstances. 


I am stressing out because she hasn’t pooped in 2 days (going on day 3). Both dogs are eating normally. I’m fearing the worst that I reversed Peach’s entire year of progress by uprooting her. What should I do? Thanks you for reading through my stressful ramblings.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: my dog and I are staying at my mom’s across the country.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I currently have a 2 year old ex-racer greyhound (Archie), who I’ve had for 6 months. He is my first dog, but I am a Masters student studying animal behaviour, and have worked with dogs and other animals (e.g. training horses) for 10+ years.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer to adopt, but am open to buying from a reputable breeder; the main reason I would hesitate to go through a breeder is that I would prefer an adult dog or an older puppy (8 months+).

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

My dream dog is a medium or large breed that is a “people pleaser”, trainable and loves to be spoiled. A non-shedding or low shedding breed would be amazing, but is certainly not a requirement. I would love a dog who wants to go on adventures with me, so would be happy to go for a hike one day and then walk around pet-friendly stores the next. While I am fairly active and like to take my dog with me whenever I can, it’s also important that I have a pup who is content to relax at home and cuddle on the couch after they’ve had exercise and play time. This “ideal dog” would also be friendly towards people and dogs, and have a lower tendency to bark (barking for a reason is fine, as long as they don’t bark constantly and will listen to “quiet” command once trained). It is, of course, important that the dog would get along with my current dog (greyhound); I would prefer a dog with a bit more energy than my couch potato, but their energy level shouldn’t *too* far exceed that of my current dog, as I’d ideally like to exercise them together most of the time, though I do have the time to take the new dog for more walks/play time as needed.


4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Standard poodle- The non-shedding coat is a big plus, and they are known for being highly trainable, playful and family-oriented. They are also a good size.

Bouvier- again, non-shedding coat, and they are just adorable! I’m also a sucker for very large dogs. I’ve only met one in person, but from what I have read they are very social, have a lower tendency to bark, robust and trainable. My main problem is the lack of availability of this breed.

German shorthaired pointer- Aside from being attractive dogs, they are trainable, playful and love adventure. A pointer is also one of the few dogs at the dog park who has been able to almost match my greyhound in speed!

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I love doing obedience and trick training, and take great pride in having a well-trained and willing dog who has mastered many tricks, can walk politely on a loose leash, and has excellent recall when off leash. I would also like to get my dog accustomed to being around livestock (mostly horses); I do not need him or her to herd or guard, but they should be able to learn how to navigate around large animals safely, come when called on the farm, and walk alongside me when I’m riding a horse.


6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I don’t want to compete in any sport, but I would love to experiment and train the dog in various activites like low-level agility, retrieval (possibly dock-diving or other water sports) and obedience.


**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Almost every day, I bring my current dog to work with me, and I would do the same with the new dog too. While I’m not actively paying attention to the dogs while working, I have the flexibility to interact frequently and go for multiple walks each day, and then the evenings are mostly free to do training and other adventures (hikes, dog parks, etc). 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

During the day, I can take the dog for 2-3 walks of 20-30 minutes each. In the evening, I can exercise for an hour or more each day; with my current dog, we go to the dog park 5 times a week usually, but I also will go for long walks/hikes and/or jogs. 


9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I’m more than happy to do plenty of grooming at home, including lots of brushing, cleaning ears and doing nails; I clip and dremel my greyhound’s nails 2-3 times a week. I would be comfortable trimming hair around ears, paws, with scissors, but would leave full clips to the groomer; I would take them to be groomed as often as necessary to maintain a healthy, unmated coat.


**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

I love giant dogs, but would be happy with anything 25 pounds and up.


11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Slobber doesn’t bother me, but I would prefer a lower shedding dog that is not a big barker.


12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It’s important that they can be off-leash, but I pretty much exclusively go to dog parks that are fully fenced, as my greyhound can’t be trusted in open spaces!


**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I prefer snuggly dogs, but if the pup is content to hang out on a bed instead of snuggling on the couch, that’s fine with me. 


14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I prefer dogs that want to please and are easily trainable. 


15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

It wouldn’t bother me if the dog barked at people at the door or in the yard, but I don’t like it when dogs bark at every person, squirrel and cat that walks in front of the house! I don’t need the dog to “guard” the house unless that’s the breed temperament (i.e. it’s not a dealbreaker at all). When on leash or if someone is coming into the house, I’d like the dog to be trained to sit/stand and wait until invited to greet a visitor/stranger; I’m not a fan of dogs who jump up and eagerly greet every person they walk past!


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I would prefer a non-reactive dog that is friendly with others. 


17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Most of the behaviours I dislike can be managed with training, so as long as the dog is trainable, I can work with it!


**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On an average day, the dog would be alone for 0 to 4 hours, mainly if I need to run errands in the evening. I take my dog to work with me nearly every day, but 1 or 2 days a month the dog would be home alone (with my other dog) for 6-8 hours.


19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My partner has most of the same preferences as me; he likes medium to large, friendly, playful dogs and is a sucker for perky ears (obviously not a requirement!). He helps with exercising, feeding and grooming, but isn’t as interested in training, though he is happy to use trained commands to enforce rules for the dog, and remains consistent with the training I do with the dog.


20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a 2 year old neutered male greyhound who is incredibly friendly and relaxed and is not possessive of me or any of his toys/bones/food. I also have reptiles, but they are in a separate (no dogs allowed) room and the door is always kept closed. We are planning on buying an acreage in 1-2 years, at which point there will also be livestock (horses, goats, chickens) on the property.


21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, only if there are children at the dog park, which happens infrequently.


22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We currently rent, and there are no breed, height or weight restrictions.


23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Saskatchewan, Canada; there is no breed-specific legislation here.


24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer days can reach 30+ degrees Celsius (86 F), and winter days can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius (-40 F). An average summer day is around 25 C (77 F) and an average winter day is around -20 C (-4F).



**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#39;m most likely going to be adopting a dog rather than purchasing a puppy, but I want to keep my eye out at the local shelters for the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; dog, so I&amp;#39;m curious to what (primary, if it ends up being a mixed dog) breeds everyone thinks might work best in my family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I currently have a 2 year old ex-racer greyhound (Archie), who I’ve had for 6 months. He is my first dog, but I am a Masters student studying animal behaviour, and have worked with dogs and other animals (e.g. training horses) for 10+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a &lt;a href=""http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html""&gt;reputable breeder&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to adopt, but am open to buying from a reputable breeder; the main reason I would hesitate to go through a breeder is that I would prefer an adult dog or an older puppy (8 months+).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Describe your ideal dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dream dog is a medium or large breed that is a “people pleaser”, trainable and loves to be spoiled. A non-shedding or low shedding breed would be amazing, but is certainly not a requirement. I would love a dog who wants to go on adventures with me, so would be happy to go for a hike one day and then walk around pet-friendly stores the next. While I am fairly active and like to take my dog with me whenever I can, it’s also important that I have a pup who is content to relax at home and cuddle on the couch after they’ve had exercise and play time. This “ideal dog” would also be friendly towards people and dogs, and have a lower tendency to bark (barking for a reason is fine, as long as they don’t bark constantly and will listen to “quiet” command once trained). It is, of course, important that the dog would get along with my current dog (greyhound); I would prefer a dog with a bit more energy than my couch potato, but their energy level shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far exceed that of my current dog, as I’d ideally like to exercise them together most of the time, though I do have the time to take the new dog for more walks/play time as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard poodle- The non-shedding coat is a big plus, and they are known for being highly trainable, playful and family-oriented. They are also a good size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bouvier- again, non-shedding coat, and they are just adorable! I’m also a sucker for very large dogs. I’ve only met one in person, but from what I have read they are very social, have a lower tendency to bark, robust and trainable. My main problem is the lack of availability of this breed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German shorthaired pointer- Aside from being attractive dogs, they are trainable, playful and love adventure. A pointer is also one of the few dogs at the dog park who has been able to almost match my greyhound in speed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love doing obedience and trick training, and take great pride in having a well-trained and willing dog who has mastered many tricks, can walk politely on a loose leash, and has excellent recall when off leash. I would also like to get my dog accustomed to being around livestock (mostly horses); I do not need him or her to herd or guard, but they should be able to learn how to navigate around large animals safely, come when called on the farm, and walk alongside me when I’m riding a horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to compete in any sport, but I would love to experiment and train the dog in various activites like low-level agility, retrieval (possibly dock-diving or other water sports) and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Commitments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every day, I bring my current dog to work with me, and I would do the same with the new dog too. While I’m not actively paying attention to the dogs while working, I have the flexibility to interact frequently and go for multiple walks each day, and then the evenings are mostly free to do training and other adventures (hikes, dog parks, etc). &lt;/p&gt;

1) We live in the country and we have a lot of raccoons in the area. Our dog quickly discovered (or previously knew) that raccoon poop is a delicacy. We know how dangerous it can be because of parasites, but when we are out with him (always on a leash) he often finds a ""raccoon nugget"" and gulps it down before we can stop him (it's like 2 seconds from discovery to swallow). There is no raccoon-free area to take him, as raccoons come through our yard nightly, so these nuggets can be found almost anywhere.

Are there at-home deworming or anti-parasitic medicines that we should use on a regular basis? How often should we be taking him to the vet, knowing that parasites could be an ongoing problem?

2) Being a small dog, house training seems to be more difficult. He is fed twice a day, 7am and 5pm. We take him out every 60-90 minutes. The current problem we have is that he wakes every night (*early* morning) at about 4:00am and has to make a poop. I've got just a few minutes from when he wakes to get him outside or he'll make a mess in the house. How do I get him to delay that morning poop to 7am?

Soon after adopting him we realized he was not okay being left alone during the day. We set up a nanny cam and he howled and cried all day. Another time we left him alone he got diarrhea from the stress and pooped all over the bathroom and kitchen. Our apartment is connected to our neighbor's, who works a night shift. We didn't want to be assholes to our neighbor so we made other arrangements. Since then he spends workdays with another family member (who has another dog, the presence of the other dog calms him considerably), and weekends with us. Lately we have been having difference of opinion in caring for the dog (she feeds him table scraps and allows him to sleep in the bed even though he is a possessive sleeper), and I'd rather be able to keep him all week and he be truly mine and my SO's dog.

Right now my work schedule is nearly opposite my SO's, so that from the time I leave for work and the time he comes home is only 2-3 hours. I may be changing jobs soon so I feel like the time to train him to stay home alone is now, while the time he'd be left alone is fairly short. But I've never had a dog with separation anxiety before, and I'm not sure where to start. 

Some important information:

-He is very clingy. I've been working on it by rewarding or praising him whenever he doesn't follow me to the bathroom or cry if he can't come up on the bed with me. I've also been coming up with alternatives to my lap when we're lounging at home (example, setting up his bed in a very cozy and warm spot for him in another room and praising him if he chooses it instead of clinging to me).

-He is trained to use a pad because his old owner had mobility issues. We don't encourage him to use it and keep him on a pretty consistent bathroom break schedule so he rarely does. He knows it's there though and if he has an emergency he will use it instead of going on the floor. If he uses it I don't make a big deal out of it.

-He can tell when we're about to leave the house and he gets himself worked up. He knows that when I put makeup on it either means he's getting left alone or he gets to go on a car ride and he gets zoomies and starts crying. 

-He likes his kennel and will use it as a safe space. He likes the door open though and will cry if he can't come and go as he pleases.

-If he knows he's not totally alone he's okay. If there's another dog around he will go back to his lazy, napping self. I'd eventually like to adopt a cat but I'd like him to be chill before that happens. 

My sister had suggested CBD for dogs (it's helped her dog's anxiety it developed after going blind), but I'd like to try good old fashioned training before I resort to medication.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I've had several rescue dogs, though I never had to do much training with them, as they were all quite obedient after they got used to me

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference, but at least where I live it's hard to find puppies, let alone a specific breed, so probably a breeder.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

medium to large (or giant), affectionate, fluffy, can join me on long hikes or cycling trips, but can chill on the couch when we're done

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I'm looking at Newfs, always had a soft spot for giant dogs, I love the sweet and gentle temperament, large size and fluffly coat, that said they don't really match my activity level, so I'd have to tone it down with them. Also looking at rough collies, as their activity level is relatively high, but not ""ate a bowl of coke for breakfast"" high like my friend's border collie. Also been looking at Great Pyrenese, as they are large, with fairly high activity levels, though I'm worried about driving the neighbors nuts, as I've heard they can be very vocal.

I also love wolfdogs, but I don't think their temperament would fit me, mainly the high prey drive and the tendency for separation anxiety (please let me know if there are any breeds that don't have those).

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'm fine with just basic training, but I'm open to doing more if the dog is the right fit

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No working, never done any dog sports, but I'd like to give them a shot, though I'm not looking to actually seriously compete

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

4-5h during work days, including excercise/walks, can do more on weekends

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

30-60min morning walk, 1-3h afternoon walk/jog/cycling, 30-60min evening walk, plus any play at home. No dog parks nearby

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I want to make sure my dog is looked after, so however much is necessary, can afford a groomer too. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

At least medium, but I'm especially fond of large and gient breeds

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Don't care about shedding or slobber, some barking is fine, but not constant

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Would be nice, but not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

No preference, as long as its not on either extreme. I already have a cat for the ""You shall pet me for exactly 2:37 minutes and then piss off"" attitude, but I also want to be able to get some work done from home without getting puppy eyes non-stop.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As long as they keep all their limbs, and I don't have to patch any holes in their pants, I don't really care. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

High prey drive, constant barking, dog-agression and high people-agression, especially if the dog is large enough to be hard to handle

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

4-6h a day (I will be able to be home a lot with a puppy for the first 3ish months though)

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

No preference

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

A cat who grew up with dogs, would possibly add another dog in the future

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

No bans

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

75-85 in the summer, with the occasional heatwave in the 90s, mild winters around 20-35f","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of my dogs can’t sleep at night without a blanket over her. It’s super cute to see her all wrapped up like a burrito, but the problem is that as soon as she’s not under the blanket, she whines for us to cover her back up. That means that a few times every night, we have to wake up and cover her back up. It is obnoxious. 

Are there any products to recommend (special dog blankets for dogs who love blankets?) or training tips to break her of this? 

\* If we leave her out of the room, she’d be fine but as soon as she was back in the room, she’d whine. It wouldn’t break the association. 

\* She’s been under the sheets a few times, which does solve the problem but is even more annoying as she ends up stripping the bed. Absolute no-go. 

\* Current solution is throw blankets on top of the bed.

I know I shouldn't be ranting about it, But I feel like some of u guys might find it relatable.

I recently got a 5 months old Siberian husky named Ollie, and she's the sweetest thing alive. However, every time I tell someone older than me about it, their first reaction is always ARE U SURE U CAN TAKE CARE OF IT? And they proceed to ask me things like ""are u sure u can take it out everyday?"" ""Will u even remember to feed it?"" They then assume that i'll do a bad job and eventually push the work aside. Seriously, it's doing nothing other than discouraging Me.

I know I can take care of it. In fact, Ollie is healthy and living the best life a dog could ask for. Is it that hard to just encourage me about the fact that I'm 15 and have the ability to take care of a dog, and reassure me that I can fight the problems I face?? I am stressed out, not because of ollie, but because of u guys.

Every single problem that might have came to ur mind when u heard about the news, OBVIOUSLY I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, and I got a dog trainer to help me with it. Or else why would I make the decision of getting a dog? Please, I love animals for everything they are, and I am willing to take the full responsibility to take good care of it.

Many might think that a teenage girl like me will just treat her like a toy, and eventually grow tired of her. But I  have experience taking care of pets- dogs cats hamsters birds, all with the pressure of others and without their help. Ollie is now a healthy and happy husky, living and proving everyone wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t be ranting about it, But I feel like some of u guys might find it relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

When I got there, two particular dogs caught my eye. They were both big dogs WITHOUT a leash. At first I wanted to leave and find another park, but the nearest park was far away since my country isn't really ideal when it comes to public parks. Anyway, so I stayed on a small area of the park with my small dog, on leash, and tried to act normal.

Suddenly, one of the two dogs started coming right at my dog so I took mine to my hands so the other dog wouldn't reach it. THE DOG KNOCKED ME TO THE GROUND AND STARTED CHASING MY DOG.

I was going downhill fast, and then one day on the side of a road I found these pups, took them in, and adopted one after they were brought back to health.

To say this dog is my life, is a severe understatement. I have gotten so attached that I honestly fear the day when I have to say goodbye to her.

For some reason in the last couple of months he's been destroying the house and hurting himself on occassion in doing so and I am all out of ideas.
First, I started giving him a smaller fenced off portion of the house because he started to go to the bathroom indoors (Vet said they couldnt find any reason he'd start doing it.) and he started to destroy the carpet by scratching at the floor where the gate was.
Next I locked him in his cage coming home on breaks to let check up on him and he ended up getting half his body stuck between the bars and my bf had to break the cage to get him unstuck.
Then I tried a fabric cage instead thinking it'd be safer which he learned how to undo the zipper on very quickly so I tied the zippers together and came home to his face stuck in the small space between them. He ended up with cuts all over his nose. 
I didn't want him to continue hurting himself like that so I just decided to let him back out and gave him a space to go bathroom inside. Which worked fine for a couple weeks but now he has been trying to get into our bedroom by scratching at the bottom of the door and the floor.

For some reason in the last couple of months he&amp;#39;s been destroying the house and hurting himself on occassion in doing so and I am all out of ideas.
First, I started giving him a smaller fenced off portion of the house because he started to go to the bathroom indoors (Vet said they couldnt find any reason he&amp;#39;d start doing it.) and he started to destroy the carpet by scratching at the floor where the gate was.
Next I locked him in his cage coming home on breaks to let check up on him and he ended up getting half his body stuck between the bars and my bf had to break the cage to get him unstuck.
Then I tried a fabric cage instead thinking it&amp;#39;d be safer which he learned how to undo the zipper on very quickly so I tied the zippers together and came home to his face stuck in the small space between them. He ended up with cuts all over his nose. 
I didn&amp;#39;t want him to continue hurting himself like that so I just decided to let him back out and gave him a space to go bathroom inside. Which worked fine for a couple weeks but now he has been trying to get into our bedroom by scratching at the bottom of the door and the floor.

1 half centimeter long; 2 mm thick.  

Very small, but the black almost leathery part of her nose (forgive me for not knowing what that is) is just NOT there, it’s like pink skin, much like when people scrape themselves and see the deeper layers of skin.

So I have 2 questions:

Does that black leathery nose skin grow back? Or will she be left with a scar? And is there any disinfectant or something like Neosporin for dogs?

I’m probably just an overly worried pet owner, haha, had her about 8-9 years, and I’m not sure where the scrape came from, maybe she was in my yard and managed to sniff a sharp branch or something?  May have even scratched it herself? She’s never had like a scrape/cut injury before, so I’ve never had to treat anything like this!!  

Additional details: She’s about 10-11 year old Jack Russel, small little girl, very healthy weight and has no diseases or infections of any sort, regular vet visits, all that good stuff.

I’m stupid, and my dog deserves better, but at the very least I can take this as a much needed lesson and do better in the future. 

So, I’m visiting a friend in Boston. She was busy for the day, so I was left alone and I figured I’d do something fun with my dog. We decided we’d try out the dog parks around here. I love mine back home. They’re big; one being almost twenty acres, and I’ve always had good experiences, so I figured it would be a fun idea to catch out a new dog park in this lovely city. Well, it wasn’t. I regret everything.

I can’t speak for them all, but the dog parks I’ve seen here look... small. There isn’t even grass, so it’s just an enclosed, tiny dirt pit. Not that flattering. So, first dog shows up and he’s snapping, growling, and basically losing his mind through the fence. I thought about leaving then. Didn’t because they said it would be fine once he’s inside and off-leash. It wasn’t fine. He ran in and immediately starting growling, snarling, and chasing my dog, which is probably when I should have left, but they convinced me to stay with promises that he’d calm down in a minute or so. “He’s all bark; no bite!” He did calm down, so at least that went right. 

So, all was good for around twenty minutes, and then it went to shit. A GSD snaps and chases my dog over a ball. I noticed lots of dogs there have resource guarding issues actually. A little after that, this guy was running in the park with his dogs, trips and falls, and smacks right into mine. To say my dog freaked out is an under-exaggeration. My dog screamed and cried. I have no idea how else to describe it. It probably wouldn’t be that big of a deal for most dogs, but mine is very soft. I calmed him down, and person-who-fall-on-him apologizes, but the whole thing freaked my dog out enough that he has refused to let ANYONE besides me pet him since...

So back the park, people felt bad for my dog because he was acting incredibly anxious and this led to them trying to pet him? Which made everything so much worse. I asked them multiple times to please stop, and to give him space to relax, but person-who-bumped-into-him kept following him around and trying to pet him, and clapping in his face to get him to play, and it was just awful. I realize he was trying to make him feel better, but no. Even when I asked people to stop, they would disregard me and keep trying to pet him. It makes zero sense to me - trying to pet a dog that is super anxious and scared, even after I asked them to stop, the audacity of some people. 

I’m getting ready to leave now, and this girl says she can cheer mine up with a tug-o-war game. She said her dog would love to play with him. I’m thinking, “fuck, I need to get out of here now,” but I’m not rude, so I told her she could try it if she wants, but I had an “appointment” to get to so I needed to leave soon. 

She gives my dog the tug toy and her dog grabs on to the other side and immediately starts growling really aggressively and being super rough, and she goes, “Oh, he’s just playing.” I take the tug-of-war you away because it looks like her dog is going to kill mine over it, and her dog starts wrestling with mine. I go to separate them and she says, “No, don’t worry. Mine is playing, it’s great. Let them play, please.” 

I’m like, “It looks like mine isn’t liking it.” And she says, “Let me take a video first, please. Mine is playing, he grows and bites, that’s how he plays, don’t worry.” So she’s taking this video for Snapchat and I’m freaking out thinking about how they need to be separated NOW, and her dog bothers mine enough that he snaps back in a “leave me alone.” And then her dog snaps back, and I’m lucky it didn’t escalate after that because I was able to grab my dog and stepped between them. Still a really close call. 

I’m like, “Yeah, no, sorry, video isn’t happening today. Maybe next time.” And she has the gals to go, “Yeah, well, my dog is a lover, not a fighter. That was your dogs fault. He snapped at her. She was only playing.” 

What? What??? WHAT? I have no idea how she could mistake her dog growling and biting super hard and being insanely rough to.... playing. Of course my dog is going to correct that behavior. It’s so rude and obnoxious. This same person was bragging about how much she knew about dogs, and how it was a huge hobby for hers, and she couldn’t even tell her dog was being rude and deserved the correction. 

I was speechless. I left after that. I’m just in complete disbelief. 

It’s also completely my fault. I was scared of being rude, and didn’t stand up for my dog because of it, and that’s just completely ridiculous. I should have stepped up way before and I should have separated them when I could tell her dog was ganging up on mine. 

I’m just shocked. It must be because the dog park was so small, but I’ve never seen so many rude, obvious owners in one place before. I’ve never seen so many resource guarding dogs in one place, either. 

I feel so bad for my dog because he’s sensitive and the whole thing was very “traumatizing” for him. He’s been in my friends room since we got back and hasn’t come out to play or meet the guests or anything. He also won’t let any of my friends pet him. He’s getting his space now, but, man, I really messed up. I just can’t believe so much went wrong is such a short time.

We assume her past life was full of neglect and abuse as she was extremely skittish (is that spelled right?) and frightened by every little movement when we first got her. She was also very aggressive about her food and would freak out if we walked by her as she ate (I’m assuming she had to fight for food prior to being with us).

Over the years she has become much more comfortable and incredibly loving. She doesn’t become aggressive when we walk by her while she is eating however, we are still cautious about it. She’s living a very happy life and we always take her for walks, snuggle with her, and sometimes we even let her sleep in our bed if she won’t get off because of a thunder storm (basically she’s living the dream and we love her to death).

She was diagnosed with lymphoma back in January and hasn’t had too many side effects from the chemo however we had to stop treatment early because of her abnormal blood counts. For the most part she’s been acting totally normal but the only thing we noticed is that over the past few weeks she’s been sleeping much more. 

Today I was outside with my sister and her dog. Her dog, Cookie, went to play with my dog (sort of playfully jumped into her) and my dog went crazy aggressive on her—like an aggressive Ive never seen. She was biting her and totally on top of her. It took both my sister and I to get her off of Cookie (luckily my dog was wearing a harness). Then this evening my brother in law was eating with my husband and she was begging so my brother in law gently pushed her away and said “no” and my dog again went in total aggressive mode and bit him and scratched him. 

I don’t know what to do because this has never happened with her before—as intense as this. I’m crying while I write this because I am scared. I feel like I’ve lost trust in her and I don’t know what to do—I love her so much. We plan on taking her to the vet tomorrow to get her checked out and possibly tests done—who knows chemo can have crazy side effects.

While I practice, we throw him things to catch and my instructor plays with him.

At the park, there's this lower part that has no ladder to go down to or up from. In the beginning he would go to this lower part but couldn't manage to climb back up. After a couple of weeks he started jumping back up on his own, we did noticed he was a little bit leaner.

Usually, at the end of the practice, I run a couple of laps around it, each lap has 100m and he would follow me on the first three, but then go sit somewhere while I run. I also noticed that he runs way better when he's off leash.

Recently he started following me throughout the whole 10 laps, so today I decided to bring him to a bigger park with me. Unfortunately he had to be on his leash, but we ran together for 1km nonstop and he wasn't as tired as before! I was so freaking happy and proud of him, it's a really warm feeling.

For backstory, every day I let the two of them out in the backyard together and they run around, wrestle, and play so well! They are besties and so excited when it's time for them to romp outside.

Today, they went out and played as usual. They were outside for maybe 20 minutes when I heard them fighting. I ran out and broke them up. Both are fine, no wounds. I was puzzled why they would suddenly fight, then I remembered what triggered the only other fight they've ever been in. Food.

There's no food outside, so I looked around the spot where they were fighting and saw a dead bird lying on the ground. Not sure if it was already there or if one of them killed it.

Now my question is, should I be more on alert with the two of them? Do I need to worry that they will fight every time if one of them kills or finds a critter in the yard? Again, they normally are best friends when they go out.

Thankfully I was nearby when they started fighting, but if I had been in a different part of the house, I wouldn't have heard them and I'm sure someone would have gotten hurt.

I know and fully understand that you need to do weeks of training for them to be efficient and safe. We have around 2.5 acres of land. The back and two sides have fences that are nice and deep so those are no issue. Our front side has a gate but we put fences around it and the bridge so the only way our dogs can get out is swimming through the canal. 

We'd like to just get an invisible fence on our side of the canal so that I can have my dogs outside without worrying about them swimming across when bored. From my research it seems like I might have to get a line to go around the entire property... which is not preferred but if it is necessary that is fine.

I know invisible fences are disliked because if a dog sees something like a squirrel it can power through the noise or shock and then it will not want to go back home but I think having the canal there makes that less of a problem. We often have ducks on the other side and I have never seen my dogs swim to chase them. They have only gone in after exploring the whole yard and getting bored lol. 

We do have two small ponds so the system's collars need to be waterproof.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions. I will be measuring our front border line today.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I have been doing some research on invisible fences. I know and fully understand that you need to do weeks of training for them to be efficient and safe. We have around 2.5 acres of land. The back and two sides have fences that are nice and deep so those are no issue. Our front side has a gate but we put fences around it and the bridge so the only way our dogs can get out is swimming through the canal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d like to just get an invisible fence on our side of the canal so that I can have my dogs outside without worrying about them swimming across when bored. From my research it seems like I might have to get a line to go around the entire property... which is not preferred but if it is necessary that is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

First time poster here. Just had a general question hoping someone might know. Just adopted a dog from a shelter that was assumed to have been hit by a car (she was found after, not seen being hit). Her back left leg is definitely injured and may need physical therapy as she hops on it about half the time. However, aside from that, her two back paws are both a very unique configuration and I don’t think have anything to do with the accident. Was wondering if anyone had ever seen this or had any idea what might have caused it. Link to image below.

I’ve had my 2 GSD’s, Milo &amp; Kai since they were 8 weeks old. They’re half brothers separated by 6 months. Milo has always been territorial of my wife and I along with our families. Mainly, the people he’s grown up with. He’s only territorial around our house and is always on alert. Kai on the other hand doesn’t have a care in the world and is just living his best life. 

My wife and I had the blessing of bringing a beautiful little girl into the world this past weekend. The dogs went to stay with my parents while we were in the hospital and sent towels with the baby’s scent for the dogs to smell and lay with.

Unfortunately, my HVAC went out and with it being the middle of summer are staying with my parents until it’s replaced. The plan was to initially go home and leave my dogs at my parents so we could get settled with the baby and then bring the dogs back in a few days.

When we initially got to my parents from the hospital I let the dogs sniff her and did a very brief meet. The dogs are staying upstairs at night to avoid any issues. Throughout the days I’ve been letting Milo sniff the baby and try to get used to her. 

With all that said, Milo is still acting weird. If I walk around holding the baby he sits and stares like I’m about to give him a treat (could just him being extremely attentive). He definitely gets even more alert whenever the baby makes noise, especially crying. When I was changing her and she started crying he was starring at her and let out a bark. It didn’t seem to be an aggressive bark but more so a playful / curious bark. Whenever I let them get close (me holding the baby and telling him gentle) he just sniffs and maybe licks her foot or hand. 

I’m not comfortable with the dogs and the baby yet and plan on going back home soon and leaving the dogs at my parents for a few more days while we get settled. I’m hoping to hear of suggestions and / or stories of similar situations. I love my dogs to the fullest but need to be comfortable with them around the baby at some point. 

Thanks in advance for any tips, suggestions, etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, owned dogs all my life, currently own a border collie &amp; husky mix

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, however given that I already have 2 dogs, rescues are unlikely to accept my application.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Dog is for my mum, for her the ideal breed would be small to medium sized. A cuddler, a dog that can sit in the car and come with you. She has mobility issues as well, so one that's okay with walking at a lesuirely pace and isn't high energy. Think 3 or 4 20 minute walks per day (20 minutes at a slow pace.) But not so laid back that they don't want to work or do trick training. 

Alternatively, a bigger dog who could be trained as a service dog for her mobility issues.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* She grew up with GSD, and I know she loves those. We'd love a pittie or a staffie, but due to their bad name can't have one of those as family members with children would refuse to allow the dogs near them (have voiced this opinion) 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* She'd love to do trick training, obedience training, maybe even some service dog tasks

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Only possible work would be if bigger breed then it'd be service dog work

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* She has unlimited time commitment (she's in her 40s) as she runs her own business

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Garden access, 3 to 4 walks per day, private secure dog run once per week, dog walker once per week, and no doubt I'd take the dog with me on my weekly hikes/trail walking

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* She'd be open to grooming at home and learning how to groom

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Small - medium, for service dog recs Giant (I think that's the term.) Let's say all sizes.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding and barking, we can handle. Slobbering, to a minimum.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly dog

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Bark, but have the ability to stop. Greet by sitting or standing back until told otherwise.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nippy biters (as adults I mean)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Unlikely to be left alone for more than 1 - 2 hours

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No preference, care responsibility of myself will likely be feeding and more longer exercise.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, border collie 3yo &amp; Husky Mix 4 months Old (by the time I plan on getting this dog, Husky will be closer to 10 - 12 months old)

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, one under 8 and one under 4

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* UK, mostly rainy and mid 60 - low 70s in the summer, and mid 30's to mid 40's during the winter (F)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* In case anyone is wondering, since I said this dog will be for my mom, no this isn't a ""surprise I got you a puppy"" kind of thing. She's been lonely and misses having a dog of her own, my border collie used to cuddle up with her, but now he's sleeping with me cause he wants to be with the pup. She's been talking about wanting to get a dog for awhile and how she wishes she had basically just a companion. 

Aiming for a winter pup, gives time for prep and to find a suitable breeder. But can be delayed to spring/summer. 

I've mentioned possible service dog in this post, I'd love to have suggestions for both pet dog &amp; service dog. I know I've mentioned a lot that might make it seem like I'm looking for a magical dog that doesn't exist. We are flexible on a lot of things, the only necessary component would be a dog who can walk at a slower pace and is okay with maybe not travelling far for walking. Enrichment would be provided in other ways such as trick training, Kong's, snuffle mats, scent games etc

&lt;li&gt;Garden access, 3 to 4 walks per day, private secure dog run once per week, dog walker once per week, and no doubt I&amp;#39;d take the dog with me on my weekly hikes/trail walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She&amp;#39;d be open to grooming at home and learning how to groom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small - medium, for service dog recs Giant (I think that&amp;#39;s the term.) Let&amp;#39;s say all sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shedding and barking, we can handle. Slobbering, to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not important &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snuggly dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eager to please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bark, but have the ability to stop. Greet by sitting or standing back until told otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nippy biters (as adults I mean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlikely to be left alone for more than 1 - 2 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No preference, care responsibility of myself will likely be feeding and more longer exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, border collie 3yo &amp;amp; Husky Mix 4 months Old (by the time I plan on getting this dog, Husky will be closer to 10 - 12 months old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, one under 8 and one under 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK, mostly rainy and mid 60 - low 70s in the summer, and mid 30&amp;#39;s to mid 40&amp;#39;s during the winter (F)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case anyone is wondering, since I said this dog will be for my mom, no this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;surprise I got you a puppy&amp;quot; kind of thing. She&amp;#39;s been lonely and misses having a dog of her own, my border collie used to cuddle up with her, but now he&amp;#39;s sleeping with me cause he wants to be with the pup. She&amp;#39;s been talking about wanting to get a dog for awhile and how she wishes she had basically just a companion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aiming for a winter pup, gives time for prep and to find a suitable breeder. But can be delayed to spring/summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve mentioned possible service dog in this post, I&amp;#39;d love to have suggestions for both pet dog &amp;amp; service dog. I know I&amp;#39;ve mentioned a lot that might make it seem like I&amp;#39;m looking for a magical dog that doesn&amp;#39;t exist. We are flexible on a lot of things, the only necessary component would be a dog who can walk at a slower pace and is okay with maybe not travelling far for walking. Enrichment would be provided in other ways such as trick training, Kong&amp;#39;s, snuffle mats, scent games etc &lt;/p&gt;

I'm rattled, but I just want an honest opinion on what people think should've happened.

A couple of important details: The off leash park I go to is mixed. Big breeds and small breeds all play in the same spot. My dog is a large breed (currently 70lbs) and 9 months. She's enjoys wrestling with other dogs but has NEVER (and I'm not just being naive) shown signs of aggression towards any dog. She's played with plenty of small dogs before (one of her favorite playmates is a frenchie) and has great play manners. The dog she encountered was toy sized, seemed very skiddish.

Here's what happened: we entered the park and I sat her down and took off her leash. She ran up, did a proper introduction with this smaller dog (the owner even pet her) with no signs of aggression and came right back. We kept walking but she decided to re-approach the other dog. Again, no signs of aggression, she did a puppy bow, and the small dog began to run and my dog gave chase. 

This is when the owner began to freak out. He started yelling/cussing at me while I was approaching as he was trying to chase around my dog. Her recall is fair, but in heated moments like when she's being chased, she tends to ignore me. The other owner grabs my dog and slams her to the ground aggressively (I heard the yelp as I was approaching), and him and I start to give each other some lip service. This fired me up because of the aggressive manner in which he threw her to the ground. In the meantime, he lets her go (she literally wasn't struggling or anything, he just let her go in the heat of things) and she started to chase this guys' dog again. Long story short, he finally picks up his dog, I grab mine, throw her on the leash and remove her from the park after being there for 5 minutes. He continued to give me lip service about how my dog is out of control and storms off.

Again, she's never shown signs of aggression and even in that moment she was clearly just trying to play  (no teeth, no snarling, no poor tail posture, nothing). I totally respect the persons wishes of not wanting his dog to play with a bigger breed, but in my mind why is he then bringing his dog to a mix park? Am I wrong in this?

It has become clear to me that she was not properly socialized before I got her and it's come out in some weird ways. Training has been at a standstill because I can't find something to motivate her.

She's not motivated by food. She's not motivated by toys (in fact, she's afraid of toys). She's not motivated by praise or pets. 

No matter what command you ask of her, her reaction is to lie down and look away like you're being threatening to her. (I guess it'd be easy to teach her to lie down? Haha.)

Leash training has been a nightmare. She isn't a tugger in the traditional sense, but she'll do things like randomly stop walking and sit down and refuse to move until you physically lift her and get her walking again. When she does walk, it's kind of a nervous gait and she'll cross in front of you over and over again in some sort of odd attempt to stay as close to you as possible. Shortening the leash to keep her to one side panics her.

She surprisingly has really good recall despite this, but that's as far as I've been able to get with her. 

We've had her for a little over a month, so maybe it's just going to take more time, but I'd *really* like to get some obedience started because we live on a farm and she has to know the proper ways to behave around the livestock. Simply recalling her isn't going to be good enough for the long term. Nor does it allow the animals to adjust to her presence when she runs at them and has to be called back.

For all of the trouble, she's a really good dog. She's patient and careful with the kids. She's great with baths and nail trims. There's a confident dog in there and you can see it come out at times, but it's just taking a lot of work to get there, so advice on how to help bring her out of her shell and find a way to motivate her would be awesome.

I tried searching this sub for some help, but I seem to have a unique scenario.  I've already reached out to friends/family/our vet for help and I've tried every suggestion, so I'm coming to you for help.  If this has already been answered, I'd love a point in the right direction.  I'll try to keep this brief, but I want to include as much relevant information as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Just over 4 years ago my wife and I adopted a puppy born in a shelter, they we're entirely sure what breed she was (only had the mom to go by and didn't do testing) but they assumed she was some sort of shepard/collie mix so we knew she'd need a lot of stimulation going into it.  Training was everything we hoped it would be, house breaking was (mostly) a breeze, she was super fun to work with, and we all had a blast.  About six months go by and we decide to jump on getting a second dog (the shelter we adopted dog #1 from posted a 6 month old puppy needing a home on social media).  Training for her was a bit different, but she caught on to the basic commands pretty well.  It was at this time I really started to get into running as a hobby.  Dog #2 never really was into it (she's some sort of lab mix and doesn't really care for longer runs) but Dog #1 absolutely loved running everywhere with me.  As I got more conditioned, I would leave her home for the longer (5+ mile runs) but would sometimes do half runs with her and half alone.  About a year or so of this behavior goes by and everything is smooth.  Until one day it's not.  Dog #1 REFUSES to leave the yard, she's 100 pounds and absolutely will not move.  I can get her to move by the length of the leash by walking to the end, crouching down and reaching out to her.  She'll come to me, and stop.  The furthest we made it was maybe 50 yards away, leash length by leash length.  I ended up carrying her back home because she started to snarl/growl the further away we got.  After a couple weeks of no running I brought her into the vet assuming she had some sort of injury, but nothing. We tried re-training with food and with a clicker with no results.  I tried driving to a location (she loves car rides) and walking from there, but she refuses to stray too far from the car (leaving even dog parks out of a possibility).  A few months later my wife got pregnant, we had a child, and life just happened.  Now almost a year and half later Dog #1 is having some behavioral issues.  Starting fights with Dog #2, growling randomly, having some food aggression etc.  I assume she's bored out of her mind (she runs in the yard, fetch, etc., but no where near what she needs).  I want to do everything in my power to make sure she has a happy life, so I'd like to start bringing her on runs again, but after 2 days of trying again I'm not sure what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the book, but I'm at a loss.  I don't want to give her up and re-home, but she's currently a potential threat to my child and that is absolutely not okay.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - dog used to run daily with me, until she didn't, refuses to leave the yard.  No life changes happened around the time of the behavior change, re-training with food, rewards, etc. hasn't worked.  She is about 4.5 y/o, shepard-collie mix (we think), roughly 100 lbs, spayed before we adopted, and healthy according to the vet. How do I change this behavior?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I was really hoping for some ideas. I think I'm going to get some puzzle feeders so eating will take longer.

Hopefully some people here have more experience with heart worms and can offer me some advice! Thanks!

Mason is 5yrs old. He weighs about 75-80lbs(wouldn't stay still on the scale at the vet). 

He is from rural oklahoma. 
His fur is double coated and I swear basically water proof. 
He carries his tail both sometimes high curled towards his back and then sometimes down low(especially if he is focused on stalking a squirrel outside.

Personality:
The most gentle dog you'll ever meet. Great with all other dogs, cats, people. He has been attacked by another dog before(bit on the neck) and didn't even try to fight back. 

He can be sneaky/sly. 
Likes to dig random holes in the yard and stalking squirrels/birds is one of his favorite pass times. 

He is a great listener inside the house and in a fenced in area, but runs and runs and runs if he gets loose(his recall is getting better with work). At the dog park he spends his time running from end to end ignoring other dogs for the most part. Learns new tricks fast.

Unfortunately, she (Tiny) isn’t fond of me. Whenever I go to my gf’s place, Tiny will greet me at the door, bark a few times, move around a bit, then go hide under gf’s bed or couch for almost the entire length of my visit. If Tiny’s out and about in the apartment, she’ll back away or run under the bed if I try and approach her, no matter how slowly. I can entice her with food, but she’ll create distance the instant she takes the morsel out of my hand (I offer food during nearly every meal I eat around Tiny, which is several times a week). Without her being leashed or held in my gf’s arms, I would say I’ve only been able to get close enough to pet her ten times in six months. She’s the most cat-like dog I’ve ever encountered, and it frustrates me.

I am an enormous dog person but I’ll admit that I really don’t love toy breeds like poms, and this pup is stupidly cute; emphasis on stupid. I like (not love) Tiny, but whenever my gf hands her to me I have this primal urge to just squeeze her tiny body until her ribs snap and her bug eyes pop out (this is called Cute Aggression and is apparently quite common, inb4 I get labeled a psycho dog-squeezer). I obviously resist that urge; however once the first week or so I knew my gf and Tiny, I think I was too rough with her and pet her too hard. I’m not used to a three/four pound dog and likely scared her with a too-tight squeeze and sudden Simba-grab. I’d guess her mistrust of me began then, but there was a period of time after that where she acted normally around me.

I love my girlfriend with all my heart and so does she, and we plan on spending our lives together, which means another ten years or so with Tiny too (she loves her dog as much as me if not more lol). I’ll be effectively moving in with her in a couple months and desperately want to have a healthy two-people-and-a-dog situation going on, but the way her dog presently acts around me, that cant happen. It’s beginning to make me resent Tiny, as I feel her behavior around me could become a dealbreaker for my gf (pure speculation though).

She has never snarled at me or tried to bite me. Sometimes when my gf is holding her and I come over to pet her, she’ll start shaking/shivering, as if she’s terrified of me :(   This has been happening more and more frequently lately.

I’ve read that Poms are very protective and selfish of their owners; could it be that Tiny is jealous of her mom’s new boyfriend who’s been stealing attention previously showered on her? When I’m not around, she’s allegedly a hyper little goofball. I would love to learn to love this pup, but I need her to at least tolerate my presence before that can happen.

So r/dogs, what do I do here? I’ve tried offering her food, which she’ll appreciate right up until the food is in her mouth and out of my hand. I’ve held her leash when the three of us go on walks, I offer tons and tons of verbal praise whenever I see her... what else can I try and do to earn this dog’s trust/affection?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend of six months has a 3 year old female Pomeranian named Tiny who is aptly named and just stupidly adorable (more on this later). Unfortunately, she (Tiny) isn’t fond of me. Whenever I go to my gf’s place, Tiny will greet me at the door, bark a few times, move around a bit, then go hide under gf’s bed or couch for almost the entire length of my visit. If Tiny’s out and about in the apartment, she’ll back away or run under the bed if I try and approach her, no matter how slowly. I can entice her with food, but she’ll create distance the instant she takes the morsel out of my hand (I offer food during nearly every meal I eat around Tiny, which is several times a week). Without her being leashed or held in my gf’s arms, I would say I’ve only been able to get close enough to pet her ten times in six months. She’s the most cat-like dog I’ve ever encountered, and it frustrates me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an enormous dog person but I’ll admit that I really don’t love toy breeds like poms, and this pup is stupidly cute; emphasis on stupid. I like (not love) Tiny, but whenever my gf hands her to me I have this primal urge to just squeeze her tiny body until her ribs snap and her bug eyes pop out (this is called Cute Aggression and is apparently quite common, inb4 I get labeled a psycho dog-squeezer). I obviously resist that urge; however once the first week or so I knew my gf and Tiny, I think I was too rough with her and pet her too hard. I’m not used to a three/four pound dog and likely scared her with a too-tight squeeze and sudden Simba-grab. I’d guess her mistrust of me began then, but there was a period of time after that where she acted normally around me.&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Daniel and I am a teacher. Summer is here and I have a few months off until school starts up again. I am having trouble relaxing and started contemplating what I can do with my free time to help the community and our world. Then I stumbled upon some Youtube videos on how to start a small e-commerce store. I thought, ""Wow! Maybe I can start an online store and a percentage of the net profits will go to charity.""

It took me a while to think about what kind of products and charity work I was most passionate about. I remember thinking about those topics when all of a sudden my dog, Hank, rest his head on my lap. It was at that moment I realized that my passion was helping rescue animals. We decided to name the store, Hank's Pet Store. 15% of net profits would go to animal shelters. We recently collaborated with Austin Pets Alive! We agreed that for this year, starting out, the percentage of profits would go to them.

At first, we thought selling basic pet supplies would be best, but after a month we only sold 2 products. Hank and I actually thought about quitting the store because it started to put a strain on the budget. However, we wanted to reach out to you all and ask for your help.

We decided on focusing on just a few products (1-5 items). Currently, the focus is collars and leashes for pets. Here are some examples of what they look like (scroll down to see them): [https://hankpetstore.com/](https://hankpetstore.com/)

Throwaway account due to the amount of personal information. I'll try to keep it as condensed as I can.

My husband was an army ranger for 15 years and retired. He decided he wanted to get in to volunteer search and rescue work. He has a friend who is also an army ranger who breeds Belgian Malinois and has contracts with the military and a few government agencies. To my understanding, these are really exceptional bloodlines and all the dogs have gone to working homes in either the military or law enforcement and he does some private sales. My husband's friend did not have any litters open but did have a one year old female that had a unique situation. This dog was sold as a puppy to a man who lied about being prior military and law enforcement. My husband's friend thought he had vetted him and sold him the dog under a pretty strict contract. Long story short, this person lied about their credentials and when the friend stopped getting updates on the dog, decided to drive by and check on her and found her tied in the yard seriously emaciated.

The friend immediately confiscated the dog and rehabbed her over three months and my husband took her in at the beginning of May with the intention of training her in search and rescue. She is fully crate trained, house trained and knows basic commands. She was 100% my husbands dog. My husband and I married when I was in med school and I just started my third and final year of residency. The beginning of June, my husband died unexpectedly from a traumatic cardiac arrest. His passing aside, I now have a Belgian Malinois that I did not intend to have and have no idea what to do with. I work 10 - 18 hours a day in residency. I cannot leave the hospital to come home and walk her. I get up as early as I feasibly can and take her for a run before work and I've hired a dog walker to come during the day but I don't know what else I can do. I also walk her at night but the physical and mental exhaustion from residency really hinder my ability to give her as much exercise and stimulation as she needs.

My problem is that she is reactive on leash. She postures up to other dogs and barks and growls. I have no idea if she is a good candidate for daycare because of this. I worry about even taking her to the dog park. When she was being rehabbed she was in the ""pack"" of dogs that my husbands friend had but she got in a scuffle there as well which resulted in her getting bit in the face. My husband's friend is currently deployed and his wife cannot reasonably take this dog back as she already has several. (I haven't asked yet but this seems like the lousiest option.) This dog is exceptionally sweet and I really like her but I want to do right by her.

I am open to any and all suggestions. I live in an apartment in a very urban city so a fenced in backyard isn't an option. She is currently run in the morning, walked during the day and gets a few walks at night. She has plenty of chew toys and we do a ton of ""fetch"" IN the apartment but that definitely isn't enough. If anybody could point me in the right direction I would be very appreciative. I've never owned a dog and don't know the first thing about them but I do know Belgian Malinois' really aren't a great dog for a first timer.

Thank you for your time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone. Throwaway account due to the amount of personal information. I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it as condensed as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I am in my mid 40's and have owned and trained dogs all my life.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Slight preference to rescue

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Small to medium (under 30 pounds) Good off leash. Good with other pets and children of all ages. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We have a Great Pyrenees now and are looking to add a second dog to the family. Preferably a smaller one so we don't have to upgrade vehicles. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

 Basic obedience 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We interact with our pets whenever we are home. Two long walks a day. Dog parks or hiking on weekends. The dog would be home with another dog and two cats approximately 8 hours per day. We would make arrangements for scheduling more time at home initially or if we end up with a puppy. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Two long walks daily. Dog parks or hiking on weekends. Day care at least once per week. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We own a Pyrenees. We are used to lots of grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

small to medium. Under 30 pounds or so. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We are used to lots of shedding and barking. We can handle some slobber but would probably rather not adopt a breed that slobbers a lot. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Important. Our Pyrenees has horrid recall even with consistent training and it limits what we can do with her. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Either is fine. Somewhere in between would be nice. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Somewhere in between would be ideal. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

We'd like the dog to greet strangers politely. Our Pyrenees barks at people at the door ( and almost everything else) but is polite when being introduced to people. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. We spend a lot of time with our dogs socializing to prevent this and a dog that is aggressive to other pets would not fit in with our lifestyle. That said, Pyrs are not the most docile dogs and we've had no issues with properly socializing ours. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

We'd probably rather not struggle with housebreaking. We're willing to do it for the right dog, but are aware that it seems to be an issue for a lot of small dogs.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Approximately 8 hours per day once acclimated. The dog would be in the company of another dog and two cats. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

All of the preferences I have listed are household preferences. My wife and I care for our pets equally. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Spayed Female Great Pyrenees - 1.5 years old
2 neutered male cats - adult

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes. Of all ages.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No. We own our home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

USA - There are no breed restrictions in our city.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 80-90 F and humid, winter down to -20 F in February

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in between would be ideal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d like the dog to greet strangers politely. Our Pyrenees barks at people at the door ( and almost everything else) but is polite when being introduced to people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. We spend a lot of time with our dogs socializing to prevent this and a dog that is aggressive to other pets would not fit in with our lifestyle. That said, Pyrs are not the most docile dogs and we&amp;#39;ve had no issues with properly socializing ours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d probably rather not struggle with housebreaking. We&amp;#39;re willing to do it for the right dog, but are aware that it seems to be an issue for a lot of small dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 8 hours per day once acclimated. The dog would be in the company of another dog and two cats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the preferences I have listed are household preferences. My wife and I care for our pets equally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spayed Female Great Pyrenees - 1.5 years old
2 neutered male cats - adult&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. We own our home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USA - There are no breed restrictions in our city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer 80-90 F and humid, winter down to -20 F in February&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

**Introduction**

1. **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?** No. I currently have a (maybe) 6 year old mutt we adopted from a shelter five years ago. She was supposedly a cattle dog mix. I suspect she might be more of a GSP mix, but she's very mutty. She is energetic, willful, and generally likes other dogs. She has some neuroses (and came with a lot more), but we've been pretty successful in training them out of her/minimizing them. I also grew up with multiple dogs (mostly English Setters, but also a wire-haired dachshund a bearded collie, but I didn't train those.
2. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?** I have a preference for a rescue, but I'm considering getting on the list for breed specific rescues. I would consider a reputable breeder if I can't find the type of dog I'm looking for in a local shelter/through an adoption program.
3. **Describe your ideal dog.** My ideal dog would be energetic and robust enough to run several miles while I'm running or on a mountain bike (once its reached an appropriate age and fitness). My current dog has done this for years with me, but as she gets older she is less interested in longer or faster outings (though it seems to be as much about interest as fitness). My ideal dog would be trustworthy off-leash, at least not to run off. It would have a coat that wasn't too difficult to take care off and wouldn't be too naturally stinky. I'm spoiled by my current dog whose hair holds nothing, not mud, not burrs. It would be good with kids and not insane in the house. My ideal dog would be able to enjoy the outdoors in winter, but I'm open to coats.
4. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** I grew up with setters and love bird dogs. I'm not sure I want to deal with setters' coats, but I do love them. I'm particularly interested in German Shorthaired Pointers, Vizslas, Wire-haired Pointing Griffons. I also like Australian Cattle Dogs and Rhodesian Ridgebacks as they seem to be pretty ideal outdoor companions, but I'm slightly less confident as to how they'd act with my 3 year old son.
5. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?** Have good recall off leash. Run beside a mountain bike on leash. Follow the bike on leash. Aside from that, the basic: sit, stay, shake, touch, roll over.
6. **Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?** Just participation in my sports. If I got a bird dog, I may work with it a bit on its ""hunting"" skills, but I don't hunt myself, so I'm not super worried about whether it holds a point until the shot.

**Care Commitments**

**7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?** An hour or so (outside of exercise)? I currently spend a lot of time with my dog but we aren't specifically interacting/training as much as we did when she was young. We're mostly outside together. When she was young, we probably spend 45 min to an hour a day working on training.

**8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?** Right now I take my dog out for a \~45 minute mountain bike ride most mornings, with the majority of that being off leash. She then gets two more \~ mile walks a day. When she was younger and had more energy, the morning outings were longer and that would be fine if I got another dog. We don't go to the dog park that much (though did yesterday).

**9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?** If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? I would prefer not to do tons of difficult brushing. Right now I give my dog a rub down with a hound glove every day when we return from our morning walk, but I don't want to spend 10 minutes a day working out knots. Most things we're open to doing at home. After years and multiple attempted methods, we now pay a groomer to trim our current dogs nails.

**Personal Preferences**

**10)	What size dog are you looking for?** I'm open regarding size as long as the dog meets the other requirements.

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? **I'd prefer less shedding if possible (though currently have a somewhat sheddy dog). Some barking is fine, but wouldn't want a really barky dog. I would also prefer not tons of slobber.**

**12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?** Of primary importance. My other dog and I do this every day.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? **Not a giant deal to me. Our current dog is on the snuggly side.**

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? **Outside of training ease, I'm fine either way here too.**

15)	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? **Some barking, but not actual aggression. I'd be fine with ignoring them too.**

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? **I'd prefer not to, but my current dog can be a little bit, esp. on leash, so I have experience in managing/minimizing that. I'm more worried about potential off leash aggression.**

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? **Aggression toward household members/children**

**Lifestyle**

**18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?** Right now our dog probably averages 4 hours a day alone she's fine staying longer in a pinch though and it would be great to be able to continue this.

**19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?** My wife likes snugglier dogs. She does a minority of the walking and hangs out with the dog a lot.

**20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?** We have one dog. She's a \~50 mutt that seems to be a sporting mix of some kind. She likes to play with other dogs, esp. those that aren't too dominant. One purpose of getting another dog would be to provide her with companionship/a playmate as we're moving a bit farther away from her best dog friend. My wife claims she wants to get chickens later, but that's somewhat unlikely to happen.

**21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?** Every day. I have a three year old son who is pretty good - but not perfect - in his dog interaction.

**22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?** We won't be getting another dog until we're moved into a house that we own with a fenced yard (though technically, there aren't any restrictions on the house we rent now if the perfect dog popped up before we move)..

**23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?** No.

**24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?** It's pretty warm in the summer, averaging probably 85 and humid and getting into the low mid 90s for stretches. In the winter it is usually in the teens to high single digits when we go out for our morning adventure. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

Not a lot. I feel like I have a decent idea of what might fit, but I'd love to hear others opinions. When we're settled in our house, we might consider further adding a snugglier, less active dog to our pack, but this dog is more to both provide companionship for our current still very active dog and to provide an exercise partner for me as our other dog slows down a bit.

• male, 8 months, not neutered 
 •The shiba had been living with its father and brother and the breeder before and the breeder said that he never saw it ever show any signs of aggression towards anyone.

•he whines all hours of the night and doesn’t go to bed easily 
•he easily becomes aggressive and snaps at people if he doesn’t feel comfortable 
•seems to play well with other dogs and goes on long walks everyday

When he was brought home though this was not the case. He hated my first roommates cat, growling and barking at it when the cat would get too close. On top of that his interactions with dogs have not been great, while he has had interactions that went well he has had many more that went very poorly.

After all this occurred I called the rescue in order to maybe talk to the foster family he lived with in order get advice and that's when they informed me it wasn't actually a month but only one day because of an overflow, so they misled me. I know they said a month as well because I took my other people with me to adopt him and they all stated that the rescue said a month as well. On top of that they based the fact that he was good with cats and dogs based on the fact that he wouldn't chase them at adoption events. Despite it all good intentions or not he was given to the wrong home. Beyond that he is an amazing dog in almost every way, but with my roommates cat that he has had for years and me constantly being around family members with other dogs the anxiety associated has ruined my quality of life and even hindered my personal relationships. He has zero human aggression, he just needs a home where he is the only animal so he can relax and enjoy himself without being unfairly put in situations that he obviously is not comfortable with.

I live in North West Ohio (Toledo area) and I am trying to work with rescues in order to find him a good home. I just want to be honest and do it right so that he can live his best because I believe my responsibility as his current owner is to provide him with his best life and its unfortunately is not with me. All I'm really asking is if any of you who were in situation similar to me, what did you do? What is the best way to get him into a great home? Are any of you familiar with my area?

My 3 other roommates and I made it very clear to the realtor that we needed dog friendly housing and would be more than willing to pay extra if need be. The realtor lied about all of the houses being dog friendly, and basically took her commission and left as soon as the lease was signed and the landlord had to break us the news that were in a 1 year contract in an apartment that absolutely doesn’t allow dogs (that’s just the summary, there’s way more to the story if anyone cares to hear it but that’s the gist). I tried negotiating with the landlord (ie I’ll pay pet rent, I’ll pay for a yearly professional cleaning), but they won’t budge. In the addendum, it says no pets are allowed but the realtor told us that that wasn’t true— we’re all 20 year olds so believe you me when I say this was a horrible life lesson to me in not believing everything someone says. This whole situation was incredibly naive on my part and I feel absolutely terrible.

My family back home in New England offered to care for my dog just for the school year, and I would take care of him when I come home for winter and summer breaks. However, both my mom and dad are horribly allergic: my mom isn’t too bad but my dad can barely sleep at night it’s so hard for him to breathe. I feel a huge weight on my conscience burdening them with my dog for the year the lease lasts— it wouldn’t just be watching a dog, their quality of life would decrease because of it. 

I’m trying to weigh my other options, and I wanted other opinions and thoughts on this situation. I was thinking of long term boarding options but really dislike the thought of that: I don’t think my dog would do well. I also thought of re-homing: there are a couple family friends that I reached out to and they said they’d be happy to adopt him, but it would be forever. 

I already feel really low about this whole thing so I really hope I can come up with a solution that will provide the best outcome for my dog.

TL;DR; Realtor lied and told us all apartments were dog friendly, so now I’m stuck in a dog unfriendly apartment for a year and am unsure if I should give my dog to my family for that period of time since it would greatly lower my parents quality of life or if I should re-home him.

UPDATE: I got in contact with my realtor’s boss who is livid about the situation. She is currently speaking to the landlord to try to work out a deal for us. In the mean time, she has suspended my realtor’s practice in her real estate firm. My family and I have spoken to a real estate lawyer (my uncle, who I’m grateful for and helped a ton, practices medical malpractice law) and we’re planning to bring the realtor to small claims court for breach of fiduciary law in NY.  The real estate lawyer has made it clear that I’m not able to be released from the lease, and subletting isn’t an option. Hopefully the realtor’s boss will be able to come to an agreement with the landlord for my dog, but if this doesn’t work out then my family and I have talked about ways we can alleviate the burden on their wellbeing and they will care for him for the school year. All of these conversations were inspired by suggestions made on this thread, so thank you to everyone who commented. I was so low this morning but I feel really hopeful now that I’m doing something productive about the situation to try to right the wrong I did. If there’s any huge updates I’ll let you all know :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to grad school in NY this September and finding housing was frustrating. My 3 other roommates and I made it very clear to the realtor that we needed dog friendly housing and would be more than willing to pay extra if need be. The realtor lied about all of the houses being dog friendly, and basically took her commission and left as soon as the lease was signed and the landlord had to break us the news that were in a 1 year contract in an apartment that absolutely doesn’t allow dogs (that’s just the summary, there’s way more to the story if anyone cares to hear it but that’s the gist). I tried negotiating with the landlord (ie I’ll pay pet rent, I’ll pay for a yearly professional cleaning), but they won’t budge. In the addendum, it says no pets are allowed but the realtor told us that that wasn’t true— we’re all 20 year olds so believe you me when I say this was a horrible life lesson to me in not believing everything someone says. This whole situation was incredibly naive on my part and I feel absolutely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family back home in New England offered to care for my dog just for the school year, and I would take care of him when I come home for winter and summer breaks. However, both my mom and dad are horribly allergic: my mom isn’t too bad but my dad can barely sleep at night it’s so hard for him to breathe. I feel a huge weight on my conscience burdening them with my dog for the year the lease lasts— it wouldn’t just be watching a dog, their quality of life would decrease because of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to weigh my other options, and I wanted other opinions and thoughts on this situation. I was thinking of long term boarding options but really dislike the thought of that: I don’t think my dog would do well. I also thought of re-homing: there are a couple family friends that I reached out to and they said they’d be happy to adopt him, but it would be forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already feel really low about this whole thing so I really hope I can come up with a solution that will provide the best outcome for my dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; Realtor lied and told us all apartments were dog friendly, so now I’m stuck in a dog unfriendly apartment for a year and am unsure if I should give my dog to my family for that period of time since it would greatly lower my parents quality of life or if I should re-home him.&lt;/p&gt;

First things first, the positives.

&amp;#x200B;

I run a campground as a job, which means i can spend 98% of my time with my dog. In fact, the only time I can't really be with him, is when I ride my motorcycle.

The campground has tons of regular dogs, and a lot of visiting dogs as well. We have a leash rule, but there are some areas that they can run free and all play about. One of my questions is, if my puppy is around other dogs, familiar and strange almost everyday, will my Akita eventually be able to play about with everyone as an adult, or will he need to be on his lead/leash most of the time around other dogs regardless of socialization? I read a lot of different posts, some claiming socialization is key and Akita's are usually okay, and others that say no amount of socialization will make them truly friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister has two younger children, old enough to understand how to act around a dog, but young enough to still be well, kids. The campground has no children. Socialization around children will be somewhat difficult, because there are only really two consistent ones in my life. Obviously I should watch the dog with children at ALL times, but, will the big worry of a dog attack still be there if he is socialized with just my nieces, or should I strive and seek socialization with more than just them in order to keep it cool around other children?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been receiving a little bit of mixed signals regarding the breed in my research, and to sum it all up, I suppose what I'm asking is this.

&amp;#x200B;

American Akita's are known as really aggressive dogs, and it is in their nature. Some posts make it sound like ""if you have an Akita, don't go near another dog"" and other posts say ""with adequate socialization you can avoid having these issues.""

&amp;#x200B;

Which is more of an accurate statement?

&amp;#x200B;

And hopefully I am not burned at the stake for this, but just in case, yes, I do hope for the best, but plan for the worst. I do have plans and arrangements should the dog be more on edge, or more calm. I am hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. I am just a little bit confused on whether they are 99% likely to be aggressive like some posts say, or whether there upbringing can make a very positive difference.

Not only that, but this also seems to bother my much older chilean terrier (who&amp;#39;s nine years old and has lived with me since he was two months old), altough he never fights back he growls or runs when the little pup tries to play with him.

**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I grew up with two labs but was not the primary caregiver. I raised a german shepard chow mix from a puppy as the primary. All from the adoption center.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I will be going through a breeder this time.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Most important thing to me is a good loving companion. Otherwise, an athletic, medium-large/large, masculine dog. I’d rather him not be too intimidating though. Personality wise, I’d like a dog that loves to be outside and can go hiking with me. However, an energy ball would not be ideal. Also is loyal and loves to cuddle would be a plus too.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I’ve been researching on and off for a few years and have come down to a Rhodesian Ridgeback, Doberman Pinscher, and German Shepard. Definitely open to more suggestions!

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic to medium obedience skills and Off-leash training  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Hiking, fetch, and running would be the primary exercise methods. Yes I would use a dog park.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Yes, although I like short hair better.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium-large to large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I feel like this is a question with an easy answer: Keep the dogs outside of the master bedroom. BUT HEAR ME OUT!

A little backstory: My boyfriend and I just adopted a new dog about 1 month ago. She's great!!! We LOVE HER! But... about once a night she will start licking herself, could be close to her booty, could be her paws, could be wherever she can reach on her body. I guess it could be some irritation or something or another but if we wake up and just say her name she'll stop, and she'll stop on her own after a minute or two. It also doesn't really occur during the day time. 

The thing is, my boyfriend is a light sleeper so he wakes up and gets all irritated and leaves to sleep in the guest room which is no fun. Our other dog will occasionally essentially smack his lips/tongue but Minnie (new pup) is louder.

I know we can just make them sleep outside the room... and we've done that some nights and they have no problem with it. But we're crazy and we love having their beds by our beds and be a cute little cozy family.... I know, I know.

So... any other suggestions before the only option is to kick out the pups?i

After I adopted him, I found out dachshund and pit mixes are becoming more popular among breeders. The shelter had no knowledge of his past and they neutered him while he was there. I'm afraid he was apart of some sort of puppy mill.

But I don't think they'd want me playing with all 30 dogs trying to decide... What am I missing? I've answered the ""what breed is right for me"" questions below in case that might help.

Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I had a very aggressive terrier in middle school that eventually had to be euthanized for biting. My husband has been around more dogs than I have and is especially fond of black labs.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog for a few reasons. I think we'd be better suited to an adult dog and dogs from breeders seem excessively expensive.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Tolerant of cats, affectionate with children, not drooly, not too much shedding (my concern with the idea of a black lab), friendly, relatively low maintenance, easy to train basic manners but doesn't need a ton of mental stimulation

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We've considered rescuing a greyhound because they're so lazy. My concern with that is the cats and kid. Husband is fond of labs, but I've heard they're very high energy and experienced how much they shed. The breed Spinone seems like it could be a good fit, but they expensive. I've heard that mutts are the healthiest, which appeals to me. Many of the mutts near me are pit bull mixes, which I'd like to avoid. There are lab and/or hound mixes pretty readily available.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic manners- walking on a leash, not jumping on guests, not barking excessively. Sit, stay, come back. Also to stay out of the litter box.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'd expect a daily walk and for it to be a part of family life. I wouldn't want to spend hours and hours on training, but it would get lots of interaction with us and our daughter.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Depends a little on the weather. We live in an area with hot summers and cold winters. I think we'd be able to do a 30min-1hr walk every day. We do have a fenced in yard and many local dog parks. We also have friends with dogs that we could have play-dates with.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

If it wasn't a fight, I'd be happy to brush the dog every other day or so. The kitties like being brushed and I do it every day when they're shedding. Ear cleaning would be well within my skill set. Bathing it would be ok if it wasn't a wrestling match. Fur trimming would not be something I'm comfortable with, but I'd have no problem with occasional visits to the groomer.
Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Negotiable. I like little dogs, husband likes bigger dogs. Neither of us wants a huge dog though. Little dogs and kids can be a bad combo, so I'm open to something less fragile for that reason.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Ideally all of this would be minimal. We do have cats, obviously they shed, and this is inoffensive/easy enough to keep up with. My daughter was not fond of the dogs that barked loudly at the humane society today. It's my understanding that you can train a dog to bark less though? The less slobber/drool the better. I know all dogs do it sometimes, but some do it all the time and I find that gross.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not at all (I think... what are the pro's to this?)

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly, but also willing to give personal space when asked

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

My inclination is eager-to-please, but I also want it to be able to go with the flow of our life.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'd like the dog to bark if someone came into our house in the middle of the night. I wouldn't mind a bark or two with a knock on the door, but I don't want them to go crazy. Basically I want to be able to tell them to hush and have them listen. I'd like them to be friendly with visitors. My mom comes to visit often and is somewhat uncomfortable around dogs.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'm not sure what managing this would mean. We don't have other dogs, so it shouldn't be a problem at home. Out and about I wouldn't mind keeping them leashed, but I'd rather not have to muzzle them or make extreme efforts to avoid anywhere a dog might be. Our neighbors take their dogs for walks.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

It can't terrorize the cats. One cat is missing a back leg, so his ability to jump to get space is limited though he's still pretty fast. Neither cat has spent much time around dogs before, though. They've been afraid of other dogs they've met and would need some time to adapt.

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Right now we're home pretty often and time alone would be limited to afternoons for 4 hours max. In the future we may have more demanding careers that will mean we're gone 8 hours a day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My husband will be an equal partner. Our 3 year old feeds the cats and could probably help feeding the dog. She'll go on walks with us, but I wouldn't expect her to be able to manage a large dog on a leash.
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

The previously mentioned cats

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

USA. I'm not aware of any bans- we don't live in the city limits. We might be moving to Chicago or DC in a year or so.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 90F but can get up to 105 on really hot days. Winter: 30's or 40's, but can get negative wind chills on the coldest days.
Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what managing this would mean. We don&amp;#39;t have other dogs, so it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem at home. Out and about I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind keeping them leashed, but I&amp;#39;d rather not have to muzzle them or make extreme efforts to avoid anywhere a dog might be. Our neighbors take their dogs for walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t terrorize the cats. One cat is missing a back leg, so his ability to jump to get space is limited though he&amp;#39;s still pretty fast. Neither cat has spent much time around dogs before, though. They&amp;#39;ve been afraid of other dogs they&amp;#39;ve met and would need some time to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we&amp;#39;re home pretty often and time alone would be limited to afternoons for 4 hours max. In the future we may have more demanding careers that will mean we&amp;#39;re gone 8 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband will be an equal partner. Our 3 year old feeds the cats and could probably help feeding the dog. She&amp;#39;ll go on walks with us, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect her to be able to manage a large dog on a leash.
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previously mentioned cats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USA. I&amp;#39;m not aware of any bans- we don&amp;#39;t live in the city limits. We might be moving to Chicago or DC in a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer: 90F but can get up to 105 on really hot days. Winter: 30&amp;#39;s or 40&amp;#39;s, but can get negative wind chills on the coldest days.
Additional Information and Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26) Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I asked initially- if we know what we want from a mixed dog from the humane society, how do we find the right dog?&lt;/p&gt;

\-My wife and I have a 7 month old (human) baby  
\-Shortly after our baby was born, he was diagnosed with diabetes  
\-Alongside the diabetes, he has gone blind (or at least effectively blind)

My read on the situation is that his barking is related to 1) jealousy surrounding the baby and 2) begging for food while we are eating (this is a new behavior during dinnertime for him). The times he gets barky are times he has historically gotten bursts of energy and would play fetch/tug-of-war - but he has lost interest/the ability to play like he used to. Long walks help, but we live in Phoenix, and it is typically over 100 degrees outside when he goes into his fits.

The main way we have been able to calm him has been to make him work for treats or give him constant pets. However, this doesn't totally relax him, and we don't always have the ability to make him work for treats or keep a hand on him during the time that he starts barking.

He is my first dog. His description on the website matched with what I was looking for-- energetic, intelligent, good with cats, but doesn't always get along with other dogs. I figured we would work on the dog socialization aspect, but the rest sounded good. He was in a foster home, and had been returned by two previous adopters. The first adopter returned because he didn't get along with their current dog, and the second adopter returned because he herded around their young kids. That was okay with me because he would be an only dog in my household, and I don't have kids.

Anyways, I went to meet him, and he was great. Excitable, but friendly and aiming to please. His foster mom said he sometimes liked to ""talk"" and might be a bit reactive on a leash, but that was the only issue she brought up. I feel like my dog was very much misrepresented not only in his ad online, but by leaving out information while meeting. 

So I bring the dog home, and we're settling in. He's a bit anxious the first night which was to be expected. However, I come to find out that he has severe separation anxiety. I had to pop out to the grocery store and so I left the dog in the crate. He destroyed everything in his crate, a towel I had placed on top of the crate, and was barking when I got in. I contacted the foster and she said to give him time, he'll settle in, and that she should have mentioned that he was ""destructive"" when left alone, whether in the crate or outside of it. Great. So of course, I had to return to work on Monday and leave the poor dog in the crate while I was gone-- not only was he as destructive as the first time, but he rubbed his nose raw so badly it was bleeding. He has been getting ample exercise-- 3 decently long walks a day, but it doesn't help the anxiety.

Since this discovery, I've done research on separation anxiety, and I am not equipped to handle it. It requires very gradual desensitization to being left alone, over the course of many months. The dog shouldn't be left alone for longer than it can handle before it panics. I am not in a position to work from home, and any friends who might be able to watch the dog have dogs of their own-- which he does not get along with. Had the anxiety been stated to begin with, I wouldn't have put in an application in the first place! An application, mind you, that clearly stated my hours of work and lack of a yard (foster mom mentioned in our correspondence that he seems to do better with his anxiety out in her yard). 

I'm so extremely frustrated at this situation and heartbroken for this dog because he needs more help than I can provide. I had been looking forward to getting a dog for so long now, and this whole situation is pretty shit. I'm pretty certain that I cannot keep him because his anxiety is so consuming, but I feel sick that once again, I'd be another home that didn't work out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this weekend, I adopted a lovely dog from a local humane society.

Name: Opie

Breed: Mastiff Cross (Bullmastiff / Dogue de Bordaux / English Mastiff / American Bulldog / Rottweiller / Staffie / Pitbull)

Age: 20 months

Sex: Male

Weight: 40kg

Neutered: No

Location: UK

When we first got our pup, we would feed him solely on dry food which would be available for him 24/7. We noticed though that he was very slim (not underweight, but he wasn't gaining weight as quickly as we had anticipated) and we weren't needing to refill his bowl very often so we put him on a feeding schedule instead so we could monitor exactly how much he was eating, however he would just take a few bites of his food and leave the rest. After speaking to our vet he advised us to put him on a 50/50 mix of wet and dry food and we have had amazing results. He now eats all of his food in one sitting every time, he's put on a good amount of weight and is looking great now. We have been feeding him 400g of wet food, and 150g of dry food mixed in twice a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem though.. His poos are solid, but since putting him on wet food his gas is horrendous. I'm talking the kind of bad where I'm quite embarassed to have visitors round because it literally smells like he has taken a poo right in front of us, and i could swear that I can taste his farts in the air. Most of my evening is spent spraying air fresheners and covering my nose with my tshirt. A family member recommended putting him on a raw food diet and cutting our the wet and dry food entirely. they have said that it is also more beneficial for his overall health, his fur and that it could reduce the potency of his gas.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found a butcher who is supplying it pre-made in an 80/10/10 mix (meat / bone / offal) but I was just wondering how much i should be giving him per day? some places I've read 2% of body weight (800g) and others saying 5% of body weight (2kg) which is a huge difference so I just wanted to see what people here thought. Also, would i transition him over to raw food slowly over time (10% day 1, 20% day 2, 30% day 3 etc) or would i just put him straight on it? and how long would i expect him to have runny poos during the transitional period?

Eventually, I want both of my boys (the other is about 5 months) to eat the same food, even though I have been training them to leave each other&amp;#39;s food dishes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know if there are any grain free options that wont cause issues with either of my dogs. That way, they can both be healthy and happy, and i can feel better knowing that I&amp;#39;m not putting either of them at risk for problems both now and later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

I live in an apartment and walk her 3-4 times per day, including a quick walk just before bed so she can do her business before going to sleep.

There were a couple thunderstorms at night the last couple weeks, and then fireworks last week as well. It was the first time I’ve experienced thunder and fireworks with this dog. She paced and panted during the noise, but went out for her walk as normal and seemed to settle and sleep afterward (though she did sleep under one of the beds the night of the fireworks, which is abnormal).

Since the fireworks, there haven’t been any more thunderstorms, but my dog has become increasingly anxious at night and now she won’t go outside before bed. 

She sits at the apartment door and whines like she wants to go out, and she’ll leave the apartment, but when we get to the main building door, she won’t go further. I’ve tried to coax her out with her favorite treats, pats, etc. Nothing. She just turns around and goes back to the apartment. I even picked her up and carried her outside once, because I thought if I could get her over to the grass, she might at least pee before going back in. Didn’t work. As soon as I put her down she raced back to the door.

When we’ve come back in from our attempted walks and try to settle down and go to bed, she paces around and pants. Eventually she’ll lie down and start to settle, but then there will be a noise (everyday apartment noises) and she’ll jump up and start pacing and panting again and find a different spot to lay down until the next noise. She will also stand or sit at the front door and whine. If I try to take her outside again, it’s rinse and repeat at the building door. This goes on until 1 or 2am when there aren’t as many people coming and going. Then she will settle somewhere (it never seems to be the same place) and sleep. She does seem to relax for longer if the TV is on and the apartment noise is drowned out a bit. Only problem is that I can’t sleep with the TV on. So if one of us is settled, the other isn’t.

How can I help her anxiety? Anything others have done that help? Should I take her to the vet, or wait it out a bit? She is completely fine to go outside during the day. All bladder and bowel functions are normal and she’s eating normally, so I’m pretty sure she’s not otherwise sick.

Some info on my dog, if it helps: she is not a cuddle bug. She likes being around people in general, and enjoys the usual attention, but she likes to have her personal space. She sleeps in her own bed at night (or a floor space of her choosing) and she doesn’t like being “restrained” with hugs or anything of that nature if she’s already anxious. She also hates wearing doggie clothes, which is why I’ve ruled out getting her a thundershirt. 

Any advice on things to try? All advice is appreciated. Thanks.

So recently I had a lot happening with death in the family and didn't get my dog fixed at 4 months like I planned. She is now 7 months.

Last month she unfortunately came into her first heat. The day before I noticed the blood (so she'd already been in estrus a few days) she had an altercation with another female dog that was completely out of character. Cricket kept pinning her and chasing her and playing way too rough, ignoring social cues. 

Cricket has become reactive to other dogs now, barking, lunging, and pinning the dog down and grabbing their skin since her first heat. (however she has only interacted with 2 different, female, dogs since her heat. I've kept her from playing with others so we can work on reactivity one step at a time) 

I need and want to get her spayed. I'm hoping this will curb the behavior a bit? We are DEFINITELY working on training and she's getting better at a distance, but still can't be trusted around strange dogs anymore.

Any advice? I think the hormones changed her reactions to other dogs, especially females. My parent's neutered old guy she still loves. I want her to be able to play with dogs again.. What can I do?

EDIT: Rooster, the male border collie we rescued and were fostering, found his forever home and is SO happy! Just in case anyone was wondering.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!

 1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

 **\*I had a german shepherd with a previous partner once before but I didn't do professional training.** 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  

**\* I don't really have a particular preference honestly however I am mostly concerned about getting a good temperament and having time to train/bond with a dog. I know for the training classes I'm looking at they recommend puppies for a better chance of success.** 

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

**\* Ideally extremely affectionate, protective, and loyal with a long life span.** 

 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

 **\* I don't really have a breed preference though I'd prefer to stay away from dogs like bulldogs (though amazing companions) due to their short lifespan and health issues.** 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

 **\* I'm interested in signing up for psychiatric service dog training classes for help with my PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Skills to help alleviate panic attacks, deter strangers in social situations, detect blood sugar levels, stick close by during a depression episode, etc.**

  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

  **\* I have no interest in sports.**  

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

 **\* I work part time and have quite a lot of free time on my hands. Ideally, I'd even like to be able to bring my dog to work each day with me.** 

 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**\* This one is tricky. Due to my PTSD, I have difficulty walking by myself outside or in parks. However, I'm looking for a dog that has good protective instincts so that I will feel comfortable to walk/excercise a dog for as long as they need.**

  9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

 **\* I'm not keen on breeds that require regular professional trimming but am open to any type of grooming needs at home. However, I don't have the ability to bathe a dog at my home easily so would prefer a breed that doesn't require regular bathing.**  

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 

 10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

 **\* No preference on size but I do live in a small condo so a breed that handles apartment living would be necessary.**

  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

**\* Due to living in a condo complex there are strict rules regarding excessive barking so a breed that barks frequently would not be ideal for my home. Low slobber preferably and I don't care about shedding at all.**  

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

**\* I live in an area with strict leash laws so this would not be very important.**  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

 **\* Very snuggly! A dog that is happy to always be close by and snuggling would make me very happy.** 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? 

 **\* Eager to please.**  

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

  **\* With wariness. I do not like strangers coming up to me in public at all and home visitors are rare.**

 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

 **\*Yes, I do not plan on getting more than one dog.** 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? 

 **\*Constant barking and snoring.** 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

 **\*No more than 5 hours a day during the week.** 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

**\*My husband will be actively engaged with the care of the dog as well.**  

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

  **\*I have one cat.**  

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

**\*No.**  

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

**\*There are currently no breed or weight restrictions in my current living area.**  

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

**\*I don't believe there are breed bans though Pitbulls are frequently listed as prohibited in rental complexes.**  

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

 **\*Summers and winters are mild where a live. Snow is rare and summers generally stay around the 75-90 range for a couple months out of the year. Lots of rain.**

She is 9 years old and was rescued from a puppy farm after being used for breeding. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is extremely friendly and nice to strangers and other dogs, she doesn't bat an eyelid when the doorbell rings. She also settled into the flat very easily with no barking on the first night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that due to her being used as a breeding dog she never had any affection and doesn't know how to 'dog'. When making a fuss of her she wags her tail a little at the beginning and then just stays stationary until you finish petting her and then wonders off and lays down. She also has absolutly no idea how to play with toys despite buying the full range. I also bought a treat-release toy but she doesnt understand how it works. The only game I have been able to engage with is hiding treats, but dont want this to be the only game we can play.

&amp;#x200B;

I work from home and see her sat on the sofa most of the time, unless shes on a walk or eatting or I have bribed her down with treats. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should also say that she is very glad to see us when me and my partner come home, showing us a whole 5ish minutes of affection, before going to lay down somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do? She was seen by a vet before we got here so know shes healthy ( she does have an eye problem), is it just a case of building up trust? Any tips on anything I can do?

Let’s call this company ... oh ... American Naturally Positive, which is not the company name, but close enough.

The WSAVA does not certify companies or food.  They have released a set of guidelines for consumers to use when evaluating companies that MAKE food.  Those guidelines can be found here: https://www.wsava.org/wsava/media/arpita-and-emma-editorial/selecting-the-best-food-for-your-pet.pdf I recommend that you contact a company directly, either by calling them using the phone number on their website or by engaging them on social media, and asking specific yes/no questions, because that will make it VERY easy to tell when a company is trying to avoid admitting they do not meet a guideline.

The WSAVA says that you should ask if the company employs a full time qualified nutritionist, and then clarifies that those qualifications should be a PhD in animal nutrition, OR that the nutritionist should be boarded by ACVN or ECVCN.  Changing that into yes/no questions might look like this:

“Does your company keep an ACVN boarded nutritionist on full-time payroll?”  The only acceptable answer starts with a yes, or a no.  If they say something like “We work with several nutritionists,” then you know the company is trying to hide something.  That answer, “We work with several nutritionists” doesn’t ACTUALLY answer the question you asked!  Don’t be fooled!  

The WSAVA says that companies should own their own manufacturing, and not outsource it or use a co-packer.  Their suggested wording of “Where are your foods manufactured or produced” opens up lots of opportunities for weasel wording.  Change it into a yes/no question:  “Does American Naturally Positive own the plant where your foods are manufactured?”  That’s a pretty simple question, right?  Yes or no answers only.  If they answer with anything else, like “We use a USDA inspected facility to manufacture our food,” then you know they’re trying to hide the fact that they don’t own their own manufacturing plant.  That answer doesn’t ACTUALLY answer the question you asked.

The WSAVA recommends that the foods you feed your dog have gone through AAFCO feeding trials.  So again, ask it in a yes/no format:  “Has your new Grain Inclusive Turkey and Squash Recipe gone through an AAFCO feeding trial?”  If they answer, “Yes, we do feeding trials” then yet again, that doesn’t answer the question you asked, which was a simple yes/no question.  

Your research needs to be more in-depth than reading a marketing-produced webpage.  Call the company, contact them on social media, and ask pointed questions of the companies you want to buy food from. Then pay attention to the answers, because very few companies can actually meet the WSAVA guidelines, and their marketing departments DO NOT want you to know that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I’m currently engaging with a company on Facebook to try and find out if they are WSAVA compliant, I thought I’d throw some examples out of how to recognize weasel-y marketing speech that you shouldn’t fall for.

Are you supposed to brush your dog's teeth the same way you would brush your own? Scrubbing, getting all sides, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

Our pup Penny was recently diagnosed with Lymphoma and we did opt to start chemo on the 1st of this month since she is only six and was still acting like herself. I've read and talked to a few other Redditors about their own situations and most told me that they were glad they did chemo - one doggo just hit a two-year milestone since diagnosis and two more years with Penny would make me so so happy, but then again, it's about the quality of life over quantity.

&amp;#x200B;

This past weekend we had a 'Penny Party' and invited all of our friends and their doggos and it was a great time - Penny at one point laid on her back and wiggled her butt, enjoying the sunshine and scritches from all her adult friends. She spoiled herself to a hotdog and at the end of the day was tired (but so was our 8-month old shepherd Barret). Yesterday, however, I walked to her in the living room just in time to see her spew up all of her kibble as well as some food from the party. She had seemed uncomfortable that night and was pacing our hallway - we let her outside, but she couldn't poop. She proceeded to throw up two more times, which was mostly just water. We took her to the vet and they gave her an enema (xray showed she was constipated) and we brought her home where she drank a some water and went to one of her spots to snooze. Later in the evening she came out and we tried to give her food/treats/peanut butter/bland chicken and rice and she wouldn't take it, but did drink some more - and then immediately threw that water up.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until 5am this morning that she finally was drinking and keeping it down. She has gotten up a few times today to walk to her bowl and drink (sometimes deeply), but she hasn't pee'd too much nor pooped a lot (one small stool today). We took her on a car ride which she seemed to enjoy, but is now currently back in her comfy zone underneath our chase. She still isn't eating though.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to post on here to see if other dogs that might've started chemo see this happen - I've read online that some dogs won't eat for 2-5 days if their bellies are hurting them (even if they are not diagnosed with cancer), but I don't want Penny to starve nor be in pain if it is the cancer that is causing it. Any support/advice is appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Husband and I are heartbroken but this will not deter us from finding our next pet, as this time we will enroll in obedience classes from the start. Previous dog was about 1.5 years old when he adopted her and 6.5 when she passed.  We could never get her to break her bad habits. 


 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a Siberian husky growing up and a boxer mix that was just put down Friday :(

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I do not, I would prefer to adopt but we need a puppy so we can train it properly and raise it with our son. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, affectionate and caring. Must be good with kids (I have a 10mo). Would prefer lower maintenance as my husband and I both work full time. Would like a dog that is content with being alone but also loves to cuddle. Smaller dog is ideal as our last was 80lbs and would drag us on a leash. It would make it easier to take the dog on walks with my son and I. Just want a gentle dog. Super lonely without our Riley girl.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Have read cocker spaniels and cavalier kings are good with children. Any dog under 35-40lbs honestly. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Fetch. Lay down. Sit. Paw. Roll over, common commands. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At least 4hrs. I’m up at 6am and go to bed around 11pm. All time not spent at work would be spent between my son and dog. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Dog park on the weekends when I am off. 30min walk in the morning and evening. Play inside. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Last dog was boxer mix so i did a bath when needed, trimmed nails and trimmed the hair between her pads. I can handle light grooming but if needed would take to a professional no problem. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small/medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Can handle shedding but would prefer not to lol. Barking is okay as long as it’s not constant, okay with some slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Important but not crucial as we will have a fenced in yard when we purchase our first home. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Last dog barked and was very protective. Would prefer a more calm dog that greets visitors. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nipping at children obviously. My son will be raised to never play rough and to respect the dogs boundaries. I want to avoid an over protective dog if possible. Dogs that are prone to separation anxiety. Other than that I am open to mostly everything else

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 5 days a week &lt;8 hours while we are both at work. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Husband has same preferences as myself, we will equally split the responsibility. And teach our son once he is older. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent, no restrictions. Will own a home within the next 2 years. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Columbus and not aware of any

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 85°ish in summer and probably 20-30° in winter. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* In regards to the dog bite Friday, Riley ate an ant trap so I think it was because she was not feeling well that she bit unprovoked. We never left them unsupervised and we were 5 feet away. He just went to pet her like always and she bit. She had shown some discomfort around children prior to me having our son, but I never imagined she would bite. He has never hit her and had always been gentle with her. She was always licking him and was very protective over him. We had an intruder walk into our apartment a month after he was born and that was the first time she bit. She got him on the arm. Ever since that incident she had seemed more on edge.

&amp;#x200B;

My sweet old girl (spayed, pit mix) is 10 years old and is starting to show her age. She's had lipomas for a few years now that our vet told us we didn't need to worry about because they weren't bothering her, so we decided not to put her through a surgery to remove them unless they started to seem to impact her. But now she has two new lumps that feel much harder than the others that have already been examined. She's also started getting weird little skin tags and other growths like that.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm particularly worried about the change in her demeanor. She's always been a total love bug who loved to snuggle with people and play with other dogs. But then last night, we were visiting friends who also have dogs. While normally she's very friendly and playful, she straight up attacked this other dog, that she's met and interacted with before. I've never seen her be aggressive like that, it was honestly terrifying. Luckily, the other pup is okay and we were able to intervene quickly and she calmed right down when we did, but still, she lunged and pretty much attacked another dog without any kind of provocation. We immediately took her home and will be keeping her away from any other off-leash dog interactions for the foreseeable future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know behavior changes can be symptoms of health issues, so we are going to get her checked out. But anyone who has experienced behavioral changes in older dogs, what ended up being wrong with them and how did you help combat it?

this morning i went all the way to the pet shop to buy my girl back home a new lead and collar. i personally LOVE em both. trixie is a rare brand back in the UK where i live, so having a trixie brand collar and lead is super nice as my girls unique???? plus the lead is sort of rope like, just what i love really. i managed to buy it without my parents bickering, weeeeelllll they said ""ShE iSnT a BlUe DoG"" so that put most of my options out of the window. and now i got to buy a matching harness for her back at home so they don't throw a riot about using the blue idc belt one back at home. all in all i spent €3.99 on her collar, non padded which was a bummer but it feels soft and its not for walkies anyway, and €7.99 on a lead. 

anyway, i want to see what you guys walk your dogs in! i walked my girl in a julius K9 belt harness plus a halti lead back at home, though this is gonna change as i have enough money at last to buy her a proper IDC harness. i would have bought one today for her but €42.95 is way out of my budget, plus i can order one for £25 at home (it's on sale guys, £31.99 usually. at the pet shop it would have been. £38 ish UK money in the pet shop so I'm glad af i didnt get it). 

i also would have gotten a leather lead but they were behind a glass barrier and i can't speak Spanish for the life of me other than saying hello and cheese. from what i saw with the julius K9 ones they would have been sky high expensive. id be much better getting one back at home.

I adopted a German Shepherd about 3 months ago when he was very young (6 weeks). I was going through a very rough break up, had always wanted a GSD and thought since I was single and 23 years old this would be a good time to devote my time and attention to a puppy. 

As of now, we live in an apartment, he is crated while I am at work and let out by a sitter who I pay everyday to bring her kids over and play with him for an hour or two. 

I work long hours M-F usually 7-5, but sometimes 7-6 or 7pm. As soon as I get home I make sure to either take him on a walk or we go to the dog park. We are learning tricks and he has mastered, sit, stay, paw, rings the doorbell to go outside, and is very healthy. 

But sometimes I feel like being single, working a lot and not living in an area that has easily accessible room for him to run is an issue. Not to mention the financial stress it puts on me considering he costs upwards of $300 a month in sitting, boarding, food etc. 

I was sitting in my room crying trying to figure out a way to keep him, since trying to find a new place to live that accepts GSD’s, the expenses and the stress are becoming difficult to handle.

I know a family with two young elementary aged boys, a wife who is always home in the afternoon, will take him to obedience school and wants him to really become a part of their family despite them also living in an apartment. 

I know I will miss him if I give him up, but this situation is no longer about me and is entirely about him. I don’t want him to endure any kind of heartbreak, and neither do i, but it will be a small price to pay in the long term considering the long life he has ahead of him. 

Ultimately I would love to keep him, but financially I don’t know if I can continue to pay a sitter for anymore than a few more months, and I’m at the point where I feel like I need to buy a house in order to keep him due to the lack of housing options available.

Any advice is appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I hope this post won’t be too long. &lt;/p&gt;

(side note: what are peoples thoughts RE homing through Gumtree? I know it's probably frowned upon, but I do feel like I've given my dog a loving home - grey area?).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, when I first got her she was SUPER CUTE but also quite timid - on walks she would just walk by my ankles, would often get spooked by things like the wind blowing, didn't really know how to sniff around off lead or play with toys. She bonded with me REALLY quick - probably took about two weeks and after that we were inseparable. She didn't like going on walks with other people if I was still in the house, always had to be in the same room with me etc. (She is much better now, and since I've had her, I've moved in with my boyfriend who she LOVES and will leave the house with him, and our dog walker when I'm still home). 

&amp;#x200B;

After about 6 months of having her, she definitely got more confident (quite boisterous even!) on walks and was going off and sniffing things, chasing squirrels, playing with other dogs, but the one thing she still did not understand was playing with toys. I bought her an assortment of toys to see if there's any that she likes more than others, and the only ones she was interested in were kongs and snuffle rugs (she's very food motivated). 

&amp;#x200B;

I took her out a few times with my friend and her dog, who LOVES balls, and she watched him play with a ball. After a while she kind of got the hang of chasing after the ball when it was thrown, but not really understanding what to do with it once she got there, and it probably took a good few times before she finally picked up the ball. She instantly dropped it and came over to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months and months later, of me taking her out with balls, treats and other dogs, she has FINALLY gotten the hang of how to play fetch, and watching her play fetch is an absolute JOY. She chases the ball, barks at it, jumps up in the air, runs around with the ball in her mouth, brings it back, barks some more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so happy that I persevered with teaching her how to play fetch, I was so worried that after two years of being passed from owner to owner (she came to us with the name Coco, but when we looked up her microchip her name was Princess - I changed her name to Friday when I got her and she doesn't respond at all to Coco or Princess) and (potentially - we think!) being used as a breeding dog before we got her, she's finally got a loving home and she's learnt how to play!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve had my little doggle (Chihuahua x pug) for about two years, and I&amp;#39;ve had her since she was two - I actually got her off an advert on Gumtree as I was struggling to adopt through a shelter as I didn&amp;#39;t own my home - I did have permission from my landlord however.

&amp;#x200B;

I left a packet of Extra Peppermint gum on my bed that I had just opened (only one piece removed) and when I came home a few hours later, a packet of gum has been ripped apart with no sign of the individual gum wrappers on my floor. Originally I thought that a dog had gone through my bin and ripped apart the packet that I had just thrown out, but I am now unable to find the packet I had opened earlier and I now fear that one of the dogs may have ate it.

I had left the new gum packet on my bed and only 2/4 dogs (both being ones we are taking care of) can actually jump onto my bed, so I know it would have to be one of them. However, both are acting relatively normally so I think I might have just misplaced the full gum packet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do; should  I should contact a vet or let it pass naturally (if it was even ingested)? It's currently 9pm, and the ingestion of the gum would've happened around 4-5pm, after which all the dogs have eaten dinner normally.

My husband and I grew up with dogs but this is our first time raising a puppy as adults. We’ve talked about getting a dog since our first date many years ago and we couldn’t be happier with our pup!

We work in a very small town and I’m a member of the community Facebook page. A few months back a woman posted hoping to rehome a 14-week-old mini goldendoodle puppy. I sent her a message for more details. Long story short the Wife wanted a puppy and the Husband didn’t. Wife wanted a particular “designer” breed and since reputable breeders in our area were too expensive for her liking she traveled out of state to purchase the dog for about half the price. After two weeks she realized she was not prepared for the amount of work a puppy required and needed to give her up. She seemed genuinely heartbroken to make that decision. 

My husband and I met with the puppy and instantly fell in love. We paid the previous owner a rehoming fee and welcomed the pup into our family and renamed her Butters. She is the absolute best!

The Wife asked for occasional updates so I sent her a picture after a few days when Butters was settled in. The Wife seemed very pleased that she had found a new home!

I’m wondering if I should send her another update now that Butters is about 6 months old (she’s been spayed and is so healthy and happy!) or if that would be weird. She hasn’t asked for any updates so maybe it would only make her sad to hear of Butters’s new life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello friends!

I sent her a message for more details. Long story short the Wife wanted a puppy and the Husband didn’t. Wife wanted a particular “designer” breed and since reputable breeders in our area were too expensive for her liking she traveled out of state to purchase the dog for about half the price. After two weeks she realized she was not prepared for the amount of work a puppy required and needed to give her up. She seemed genuinely heartbroken to make that decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I met with the puppy and instantly fell in love. We paid the previous owner a rehoming fee and welcomed the pup into our family and renamed her Butters. She is the absolute best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wife asked for occasional updates so I sent her a picture after a few days when Butters was settled in. The Wife seemed very pleased that she had found a new home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering if I should send her another update now that Butters is about 6 months old (she’s been spayed and is so healthy and happy!) or if that would be weird. She hasn’t asked for any updates so maybe it would only make her sad to hear of Butters’s new life.&lt;/p&gt;

Other than that, she is exceptionally good: I could have her off-leash at a crowded music festival, she's so attentive (fixated) We're her seventh home in as many years.

While we're working on her SA, I doubt she'll ever be able to stay home alone 9 hours, and we have strategies that work in our house. If I were to leave her for 2-4 hours, I know what she'll probably do, and can plan or re-arrange belongings accordingly (ask my couch)

She's with me at my parents for her third week-long visit. They've asked that I don't bring her back.

If I don't bring her with me, I have to kennel her for the duration (6 hour drive, so I stay for at least a few days) which is expensive, and stressful. My boyfriend starts work at 6 a.m., so the day camp is not open for her to be dropped off at stupid o'clock, nor are there sitters in our remote location who would be okay with never leaving her side.

On our last visit she puked bile up on the rents' white bedroom carpet. And rolled in something putrid in their tiny back yard. Cue the midnight dog bath and floor scrub.

This time mom swore she stank like farm dog upon arrival, so we drove across town for a 10 p.m. dog bath. She peed on the basement carpet while my brother dog-sat in their house. And last night she pooped on said same carpet while everyone was home and I was in the garage. And we do try to keep doors closed and let her out often.

I've explained that she's not very obvious in her requests to go outside, and having been beaten for pooping indoors in the past (we can only guess) she is reluctant to go on-leash or ins ight, so she found a quiet place to do so.

Tonight we went to mini golf. I can't trust her for three hours alone in her crate in a strange place -- if she broke out she would surely cause destruction. And she does. Without asking if she was welcome on the course, mom made me tie her to my bumper (""what if she hangs herself jumping out of the car?"" (she has a harness for the car)) She broke her leather lead, got it stuck between bumper bits, pulled off my license plate, and put many claw marks on the jeep I just recently went into debt for, even though she looked relaxed when I checked her every 5 holes. Once she golfed with us, she was happy to lay at each hole wherever I put her and watch quietly.

I guess I'm at a loss. My doggo is a lovely lady at home, with a few manageable quirks. On the road I completely understand that the unfamiliar space and routines are throwing her off. My non-pet-loving family are't so forgiving. The irony is that my mom walks my cousins two dogs daily with my aunt, and raves about how good the crazy things are. I wish she could see how wonderful my girl is!

&lt;p&gt;What should I do? Is there anyway i can legally take my dog? Especially considering the fact that theres no legal documents, any proof of purchase or ownership, of the dog. Couldn’t i just take him with me no matter what she says?&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I are looking to adopt a dog for our new apartment and we could use some help.

All the info is in the questionnaire, but generals are here:

**Location** \- Las Vegas, NV

**Size of Dog** \- 20lbs or less (HOA rules)

**Availability** \- We both work a lot, but our shifts tend not to overlap as much. The dog would be left alone up to 9 hours, but typically not more than 6, and only part of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

All other info is in the notes below. Thank you so much in advance for your help!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

**This will be our first personal dog. We both grew up with all sorts of dogs from shih-tzus to malamute/husky mixes to labs and others.**

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

**We plan to adopt a dog from our shelter.**

3. Describe your ideal dog.

**Our HOA has strict rules regarding pet sizes. They can’t weigh more than 20lbs.**

**We work a lot. I work 6-4:30pm Mon-Thur and my wife works varying shifts during the week, so the dog would be left alone for up to 9 hours in a given day.**

**We work out also, and the apartment’s near one of my favorite parks. I’d like a dog I can play with at the park, throw a disk to and take on a jog. Something that’s intelligent that I can train on the weekends while I’ve got my three-day weekends.**

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

**I’ve always been partial to Boston Terriers. My wife likes Australian Shepherds. I like the Boston because they’ve got a great personality and are medium-sized. My wife likes Ozzies because they’re beautiful and intelligent.**

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**I’d like to train my dog to do simple tricks. Roll over, turn in circles, speak, etc. as well as play games like fetch.**

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**I do not want my dog to compete.**

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

**On the weekends, I have all day. My wife is free on evenings every day as well and has two days off each week.**

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**We can take our dog for a walk, 15-20min, daily. We live in Las Vegas and the Summer months here are pretty crazy, so they’d be inside more often unless I take them for a walk in the morning before leaving for work, \~4:30ish.**

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**We’re okay with brushing daily but would prefer something with shorter hair due to the heat here in Vegas. We’d take them to groomers every few months for a general cleanup, but would take care of them in the meantime.**

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

**The dog needs to be under 20lbs.**

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

**Since it’s an apartment complex we’d prefer a dog that didn’t bark often. Shedding and slobber are okay, but we’d certainly prefer less shedding.**

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

**This is generally important, as I’d like to be able to take them with me to the park.**

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

**Preferably an even mix.**

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

**A dog that’s more eager-to-please.**

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**We’d prefer a friendly dog that can handle visitors as we both have large families that live nearby that visit often.**

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not particularly?

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

**Excessive barking, hyper-activity. It’s a smaller apartment, 931 square feet, so generally anything that would complicate that.** 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

**At least four days out of the week the dog would be left alone up to 9 hours.**

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

**My wife and I would both care for the dog equally.**

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

**We do not.**

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

**Not for another few years.**

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

**A max of 10lbs.**

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

**Las Vegas, NV, USA. There’s no laws as far as I know.**

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**Summer**  **– 110f**

**Winter**  **– 40f**

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**We would like to adopt, but don’t let that impact your answers so much. I’d prefer specifics that will help us make an informed decision at the shelter.**

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

While working out basics of the trip I mentioned we'd need to start looking into a place to leave our dog with as well as a pet sitter to come to our house and look after my cats. 

My friends all said I should bring my dog along, that they'd love to meet him and would like having a dog around (they all have previously had childhood or family dogs but have no dogs at the moment) 

My husband and I agreed it would be nice for him, it is a trip to a house in the lake and he loves people and being with us, so we decided to bring him.

Now for my questions... How can I tell them how to interact with my dog without sounding like a jerk? 

I know they're all from the mindset that you tell and slap a dog's bum for ""being bad"" but I'd find quite unnaceptable if any of them tried to discipline my dog.

I am confident he will be very well behaved but I fear that situation where people agitate your dog and invite him to play and then get upset when the dog jumps or acts very excited you know?? 

I don't want to say they can't play with him or should agitate him whatsoever - that'd be fine outside and when we're actually going to play with him of course
Or just other things like, him being in the couch, he knows to get down if you ask him, I'd hate if anyone scolded him instead of politely using his cue....

But I don't want to be the jerk that's like ""ok guys sit down for a 20min lecture on how exactly you should behave around and or interact with my dog!"" 

He's a sensitive dog, and being scolded even once can set back our training greatly....
And I know if I try to leash him the whole time for example, they will all ( including my husband) tell me it's unecessary and an exaggeration etc....

Yesterday, I took him on a walk with his brother, and they were doing really well for most of the walk, right up until the near end, where we ran into a Saint Bernard. My puppy was very upset at the sight of the bigger dog, and he was hesitant to even come near the dog. We stopped to let the three dogs greet each other, and my puppy ended up a little bit underneath the bigger dog. Suddenly, he decided to run out and start crying. I assume that his paw was stepped on, so I could understand his concern when that happened. My only problem was that he tried to be as far as possible from that dog afterwards. 

TL;DR Puppy had a small accident with bigger dog, and is now afraid. 

I’m now starting to wonder if my puppy will now associate larger dogs with bad experiences, and, if he does, how can I help him grow out of it?

Edit: I just looked back on my other post and realized I said my puppy was a golden retriever mix, and here I said that he was only going to get to 30 pounds. To anyone who may be confused by this conflicting information, he is an Australian Cobberdog","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I posted a question about chew training for a new puppy. At that point, the biggest dog he had met was his (adopted) brother, who is less than 20 pounds. He’s not going to get bigger than 30 pounds, so he’ll be a lot smaller than a lot of big puppers out there. He’s been okay with his roommate, and he has a friend around his age (Around 14 weeks) who he’s been amazing with. &lt;/p&gt;

After browsing r/dogs, all of these ""new breeds"" popping up are badly bred low-content wolfdogs that are dangerous to their owners who think they're just getting a dog that looks like a wolf. I get that and I'm not stupid enough to chase after one anyway because I could not handle a wolfdog or anything, and I'm definitely not here to defend misleading breeders.

What stumps me is why no one has actually tried what they all claiming they're doing for real. There's a huge market for those kind of dogs, and if you responsibly crossed a malamute with a gronendael or something, and crossed the result with a black german shepherd, it'd look pretty damn close to a black wolf, and I'm not even a breeder. So why does no one do this, and instead it's all bad breeders with low-content wolfdogs? I just don't understand??? 

Like, there's such an easy solution here. Drawing on all three breeds (or more), you'd have tons of genetic diversity, and could select dogs for temperments because there's so many of them as they're a recognized breed with a stable stock to choose from. You could even try to breed out some things like hip dysplasia. I just do not get why this does not exist at all and it's all low content wolfdogs. You wouldn't even need to create a stable stock, you could literally get a well-accredited healthy malamute from a reputable breeder and get another kennel's groenendael to pair it with, and pair the offspring with a black German shepherd from another kennel. There are SO MANY of these other dogs available that you could really do amazingly responsible breeding and only select for temperament and health, and the dogs would come out very wolf-like... so why don't they exist?

I don't understand why breeders would intentionally cause this disaster when the solution, to me, is readily apparent. Again, I'm not ""oh my god it doesn't look EXACTLY like a wolf"" and am happy with a recognized breed but there are people that are, and they don't seem to be going away. As much as we can preach about adopting not shopping these people aren't going away anytime soon and there is a solution here for them that is much better than the current status quo of low content wolfdogs dumped at shelters. It is SO FRUSTRATING that no one is doing it, and I literally cannot understand why for the life of me... these people pay legendary amounts for their puppies, so it's basically free money too.

We were very anxious all weekend trying to find an emergency vet that had a MRI machine on site. Almost everywhere was closed for the long weekend. UC Davis was open but their emergency was overloaded so we most likely wouldn't have been seen. Today we called Redwood City Animal Scan and were told we needed a recommendation from a neurologist. Lucky this Animal Scan is part of a bigger vet facility and they had a Neurologist who just happened to have a consultation at 11:15. She gave my wife the recommendation and they were able to get her MRI done. I got there around 2 because of work and just in time for the neurologist to tell us what was going on with our pup. She had squished the all the liquid out of one of her spinal discs. As she showed us the scans she explained that the squish was in the middle of her back and not her lower back which was a best case scenario. Because of the squish there was very heavy bruising and swelling which caused a blockage for her neural pathways to her back legs. Her yelping and flailing from the incident was a combination of pain and being scared that she couldn't move her legs. So with that she said stay on the pain and muscle pills for the next week and after only as needed. Otherwise rest for the next 2 months and she should be her old extremely active self. She is currently really groggy on the couch from the anesthesia. Again thank you all for the kind words and support when we felt like our backs were against the wall trying to help our dog.

I also have 4&amp;amp;7 year old children who are great with the dogs and actively help with them. Ive been consider adding a puppy of a similar breed. Mainly looking at other labs, Golden retrievers, etc. Shes always had her brother, really thrived and bonded with him. I can tell she still misses him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is. Is there a good place to research for info on older and younger dogs? Any thoughts, opinions? About half the people i talk to say the puppy will just drive her into the ground. Half say she’ll probably love having a buddy again. She’ll get a play mate and the older dog can show an example to the younger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at at loss. Spoil her and keep her solo. Or add a baby into the mix. Help please.&lt;/p&gt;

I really miss being around dogs, I always had a dog growing up from birth to high school, and living alone it can get quite lonely sometimes and I have been thinking about getting a dog for about a year now(not a spur of the moment decision). I would be able to afford it without any major financial concerns even if an emergency did happen, and while I would have to change my current lifestyle a little it is something I am willing to sacrifice for a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

* It would be my first dog I own by myself as before I have had dogs on my parent's house, but I always have had multiples dogs at home to a maximum of 5 at once, so I do have some experience but as I am living by myself and I know things are going to be very different from what I was used to I want to take this slowly and not get something too challenging for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

* I would prefer going through a breeder. Again I really want to play it safe with this and getting a dog from a reputable breeder would save me headaches such as potential genetics issues and other issues. I also do enjoy the thought of a purebred dog (not that I hate mutts don't get me wrong, one of my most loved dogs, when I lived with parents, was a mixed spaniel that lived to 19 years old) as I again kind of want that safety of knowing what I can expect from it as breeds mostly have a certain temperament. Something which I am aware there are outliers. That being said I am also not against the thought of rescuing a dog and I am aware that there are many great rescues shelters out there. If you know a good shelter or breeder in New England please do recommend! I do have an open mind about all of this (the only way it works)

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

* I prefer larger dogs so something medium to large would be desired, while I do like small dogs I would prefer having something I can cuddle with and give lots of hugs and belly rubs without being too worried about the size. I would prefer a more mellow and lazy dog and hopefully something with a good sense of humor, however, I am okay with a dog that would be more active outside, but inside it would be nice to have a dog that is not very active and especially not very destructive. I tend to prefer dogs with a good fluffy fur (I blame the goldens I had as a teen) but I also don't hate dogs with short fur, but winter in MA can get quite cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

* I still have a very strong love for goldens as they were the last dog I lived with, but I am open for other types too. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are very interesting ones but puppies I heard can be very destructive and I am not quite sure how they would fair with MA winter (and I can't say I am much of a fan of dog clothes, but willing to use them to protect the dogs at least). 

Other breeds that I am interested in are Norwegian Elkhounds, Coonhound, Great Danes, St Bernards, Bernese, Brittany, Basset hounds, and Bulldogs because they are so funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one breed that I very often see recommended are greyhounds and while I met some lovely greyhounds I just cannot bring myself to love them enough to take the responsibility of taking care of one for 10+ years. I\`m sorry to all you greyhound lovers and I know they are great dogs for my kind of situation but I just can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

* Nothing too out of the ordinary, Sit, paw, stay. maybe other play related tricks. If I do get a notoriously intelligent dog I might get into it and go for harder stuff but out of the gate, there is no need for advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

&amp;#x200B;

* Would be fun but is not a major concern

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

*  of devoted time something from 1-3 hours depending on my workload. Most often around 1 - 1 and a half

&amp;#x200B;

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

* A morning walk or run if the dog (and me) is able to do so, and something like two more walks spread on the day. My Condo complex also has an enclosed dog park which I could use if the dog desires to.  On the weekends it would be nice to go hiking or take the dog for a drive or other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

*  A nice brushing once or twice a week. I am willing to do the things I need, but I  willing to pay for someone to do it too if needed or something outside my capabilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

* Preferably a larger dog, but I am aware that has it's own issues. While I would love a Great Dane or a Saint Bernard Bernard, I know that larger dogs have their own issues besides the only size. My maximum range would be a 35 to 150 and my preferred and more realistic range would be from 50 to 100

&amp;#x200B;

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

* Barking of course due to the apartment would be nice to be kept low, but for shedding and slobber, I don't care much about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

&amp;#x200B;

* Would be nice, not that major of a concern. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

* All the snugs, but something more on the balanced side is okay too. 

&amp;#x200B;

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

* I find that both are things I enjoy, while the its own thing can be quite handy I do enjoy eager-to-please types. It is one of those things I can only really tell meeting the dog.

&amp;#x200B;

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

* I often have people over but they do tend to be the same people frequently. That being said being on a lease and all it would be nice not to have a dog that will jump and destroy my door. 

&amp;#x200B;

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't have other dogs so while it is okay, I would prefer not to. But not a deal breaker

&amp;#x200B;

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

&amp;#x200B;

* While 100% might be impossible it would be nice to have a dog too destructive especially regarding wires as I have a good amount of those, I do plan on securing them for the dog but I have 1st hand experience that sometimes common sense does not apply to dogs. One of my golden puppies back when I lived with my parents ate the cable of the garage door, after somehow opening the metal cage that protected it... 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

&amp;#x200B;

* I go to school every day, but asides from that I am home most of the time, When I do leave it would be for a maximum of 6-7 hours only. And even so my campus is somewhat dog-friendly and I could potentially take him with me.  That being said I would be nice to have the dog be okay with longer absences as sometimes I have to go do something that might take longer.  

&amp;#x200B;

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

&amp;#x200B;

* I live alone.

&amp;#x200B;

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

&amp;#x200B;

* No pets at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

* Maybe my nephews? once or twice a year?

&amp;#x200B;

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

&amp;#x200B;

* I currently rent. My complex does not allow breeds that are predisposed to be ""violent"" such as Rotts and Pitbulls (which I don't agree with but oh well) 

&amp;#x200B;

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

&amp;#x200B;

* Not that I am aware. 

&amp;#x200B;

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

&amp;#x200B;

* New England somewhat warm in the summer and very cold and snowy in winter.

That being said I would be nice to have the dog be okay with longer absences as sometimes I have to go do something that might take longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No pets at the moment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe my nephews? once or twice a year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I currently rent. My complex does not allow breeds that are predisposed to be &amp;quot;violent&amp;quot; such as Rotts and Pitbulls (which I don&amp;#39;t agree with but oh well) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not that I am aware. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New England somewhat warm in the summer and very cold and snowy in winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and I am looking forward to hearing your suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

But I'm obsessed with researching dog breeds, training methods, and diets. So I'm trying to prep and get some input!*

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
I've owned 2 dogs prior, a chow mix and a German Shepherd. I have a lot of experience training many dogs though, from basic obedience to sports and problem behaviors. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
I would like to buy from a good breeder but will also be checking out shelter dogs to see if we find a good fit for us. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.
I want a dog with high drive, highly trainable, but doesn't necessarily have to be eager to please. Nothing that wants to be working/playing all the time, and can be taught when it's time to be crazy and when it's time to lay down and watch a movie with me. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
I love bully breeds, especially dobermans, rotties, cane corsos, and american bull dogs. Also chows, german shepherds, Australian shepherds, and Springer spaniels. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
Mostly just a solid understanding of obedience, but I would love to get into dog sports. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
I'd like to get into dog sports but it's not a necessity. I have a lot of experience training for sports. 

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
I will be home with the dog most of the day, minus a few hours here and there. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 
3-5 hours and I do not like dog parks but I will be socializing the dog with other dogs in safer places. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
I do not want a dog that needs regular hair cuts. I'm fine with doing all other grooming myself or going to a groomers. I'm willing to do daily grooming if needed. 

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?
Medium-large 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Little to no slobber. Low barking. Shedding is whatever, I don't mind cleaning up fur. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Extremely. 

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Somewhere in between. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
Also, in between. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 
I want a dog that will alert me to people in the yard or at the door, but can be trained to cease barking on command. I do not want my dog to like everyone and be friendly to strangers, but not fearful or aggressive. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
Yes. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
I need a dog that can be trained to have a low prey drive and not chase my cats. 

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
At most, once a day for 3-5 hours. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
My kids want a dog that they can safely play and cuddle with. My S/O wants the same as the kids. They will help play with and feed, however I will be the sole trainer and make sure they understand what I'm doing with the dog. They will likely occasionally help with walks or outings. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
I have cats and reptiles, the reptiles have their own room kept safe from my kids and the cats and future dog. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
Yes. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
No, I do not. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
USA. We have BSL laws in my city banning ""pit bull types"" covering staffies, pit bull terriers, and mixes. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
We have extreme weather. The summer is very short with averages of 75 degrees. As high as 100. Winter is long and brutal with averages of 0 or lower, and lows of -50 (with windchill) (all in farenheit)

Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
I want a dog that will be my best friend and very in tune with me to possibly assist with my anxiety attacks. I want to stay active and be forced to do things in order to keep the dog happy and healthy.

Thanks in advance for anyone that’s made it this far and is wanting to have a serious discussion about this issue.  I know that in the US, which is where I live, neutering(castration) is a big thing that most of us don’t think much about.  When I signed my contract with my dog’s breeder, I was surprised to see I could wait two years to sterilize him and I could choose a vasectomy instead of castration.  Since then, I’ve been doing some research and want to start discussion on the matter since most people don’t seem to know or talk about it.

I’ve been reading literature about the pros and cons of castration.  It reduces risks of some diseases developing but increases the risk of other diseases from developing, which are more serious in my opinion, than those that it prevents.  I’ve also read that castration doesn’t necessarily stop the behaviors that are initiated by hormonal production during adolescence, which I’ll be waiting until he passes through, if I go this route, since pediatric castration carries more negative effects than waiting until adulthood.  Some literature suggests that castration may increase aggression in dogs as well.  Either way, I’m bound by my contract to sterilize him.  I will need to decide which procedure I’d rather do but I have some time to figure it out.  I’m personally leaning towards vasectomy since the evidence I’ve read suggests that keeping the hormones is better for the overall health of the dog.

Has your dog gotten a vasectomy instead of castration?  Have you noticed, or not noticed, a change in behavior after castrating in adulthood, adolescence, or puppyhood?  What sort of backlash have you received if you chose vasectomy?  People outside of the US, since this is a more US-centric debate, how does your country feel about this?  What sort of evidence or reasoning does your country have towards castrations?  I want this to be an open discussion on everyone’s opinions on this matter.

As a temporary solution my sister and I washed her off the best we could (the water looked awful afterwards) and tried to cover the mange on her.

We had recently bought a home and began looking at local rescue websites to explore the possibility of getting a dog, but when we saw his picture we fell in love. My fiance grew up with Goldens and we have always dreamed of owning one. Both of us grew up with family dogs who were our best friends (but who we didn't have to full responsibility of care for) who have since passed away. Well, long story short we met him at the rescue and ending up going home with him that day. The volunteer at the rescue said he had just come in so they hadn't had much time with him, but that he was super sweet and loving and seemed calm, which all was exactly what we were looking for. He is also heartworm positive, and while the volunteer did ask us if we were OK with treating him for that, she didn't go into much detail as to what that meant.  


Over the last few weeks we've gotten to know our dog, and while he is as sweet as can be, he is also a nervous, anxious, stubborn mess. He is afraid of going outside, sleeping in our room, having people in our house, and most of all being left alone. We have to be around him 24/7 or he has a panic attack and barks/howls and scratches at the door the whole time we're gone. Because of this we are now taking turns working from home and have pretty much given up all of our time together outside of the house, and time with friends. I also suffer from severe anxiety, and while I thought a dog to cuddle with would help with that, the last few weeks have been some of the most stressful of my life and I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.   


On top of all of that, today was his first injection for the heartworm, and it has been horrible. Every part of the vet trip was a struggle, from getting him in the car to getting him to go with the nurse and leave us. Now he is home and is clearly in pain, despite the pain meds they gave us. He has been panting non-stop and is walking from room to room and trying to lie down, but keeps getting up and moving again. He whines when I try to get near him and is clearly afraid that we will take him back to that horrible place (which, of course, we will have to do two days in a row in a month for his second round of shots).  


I know that everything I've described here is a temporary thing and with enough training could be fixed, but as young people with stressful jobs, a small townhome, not much extra income, and anxiety/depression issues we feel like we aren't the people who can do that, and are now seriously considering calling the rescue and asking about re-homing him. I feel like an absolute monster for even considering this, because he really is the sweetest guy, but we both feel like we can't take much more of this kind of stress. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

Our dog is a husky German Shepard mix we adopted. He is aggressive with food and certain toys. We’ve trained him and he’s calmed down a lot and come a long way.

Well in our backyard where he lives we built an enclosure for our box turtle so he can roam safely. My dog can’t get to him but when we go outside he will immoderately go up to the enclosure and sniff and look in. I was trying to get his attention and accidentally rigged on his ear a bit. He bit me. I was terrified as he was shaking his head as he did it but by some miracle he didn’t break skin. I always pet him behind his ears and head as he loves it but he suddenly bit me with no warning and no time to leave.

I’m hesitant to tell my family what happened. I’ll only be home for 8 more weeks before I move out of the country and the red marks have faded. I just don’t want to upset my brother if he had to be thrown out. The dog was abandoned another time before we got him so it would traumatise him.

Should I say anything or just keep quiet? he hasn’t bitten anyone for a good year but I’ll have to take care of him when my family goes out of town and I feel resentful towards the dog. Thank you.

Edit: he is rabies free and has a vac for it. I’ve been bitten before (more severely) 3 years ago by him when I tried to pet him while he ate a bone.

- If you found your breeder online, were there pain points in the process?

- Did you have any difficulty in determining whether the breeder was ethical/reliable/responsible/etc?

- Was it important to find a breeder that was committed to ethical breeding practices?

Any insight into these questions would be massively appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve discovered through some online searches that the vast majority of dog breeder websites are very poorly designed and outdated, which leads me to believe that perhaps the process of finding a good breeder is difficult for many people. Currently I&amp;#39;m conducting some user research to test the viability of a web app I&amp;#39;m designing that I hope can help solve this problem, so I&amp;#39;m reaching out to dog owners, as well as breeders, with a few basic questions. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a food aggressive rottie who is incredibly stubborn. His specialties include jumping on guests and snatching whatever he can off of counters and running away with it (often eating it and pooping it back out whole (like socks)). He has recently gotten *extremely* aggressive about his food, growling and even snapping at my husband and I both when we get near him.

We have raised him from birth, not around other dogs, so this behavior is not really ""earned"" so to speak. He should have no fears or worries about his food. We tried to train it out of him when he was young and had largely been successful, but it has started up again and now he is 115 pounds and I can't do much about it.

I need a strong-willed, somewhat heavy-handed dog trainer to help me with this, since he is so big and so stubborn. I have worked with Jodie Varner already and she was wonderful, but not really prepared for such a big, stubborn boy.

Does anyone have any suggestions? and does anyone know of a good trainer? I'm not opposed to sending him somewhere for training, but I was hoping we would find someone we don't have to send him away to.

Edit: any and all of our methods have been discussed thourouly with my vet before use. This includes our very brief use of a shock collar for NON AGRESSIVE bad behaviors.

He is a happy go lucky idiot, he loves all other dogs and people no matter what. I don’t take him to the dog park much anymore but I would like to. It’s a nice private dog park and I’ve never had problems taking my dogs except with my bloodhound. The problem is mostly when we first arrive to the dog park and he’s meeting all the other dogs and looking for a buddy to play with. 


Some other dogs find him obnoxious, I think because he’s huge, goofy and bouncy. Playful dogs and puppies love him but mellow dogs don’t and he doesn’t understand when it’s time to move on. He greets politely and meekly but then when his attempts to start playing are rebuffed, he tends to keep on trying by repeatedly giving them the play bow until the other dog is annoyed. When another dog is disinterested, growls at him or snaps at him, he doesn’t get the message. I think because he’s so big, he doesn’t feel any pain or fear with the corrections and so he thinks they’re just playing. Growling at him seems to get him more in the mood to play so he tends to try to initiate  play with the exact wrong dogs. I have to intervene a lot with him when we first arrive at the dog park until he finds buddies that actually are there to play chase and wrestle. He usually sticks by those dogs for the entire time at the dog park and I don’t have to intervene anymore. So, he plays well, he just has trouble picking out the dogs that want to play. 





Here’s what I’m doing to help him now: 

I take him for a mini hike in the foothills next to the dog park to tire him out before going into the dog park. 


Redirection: I keep him under control by using tennis balls. When I see him annoying a dog, I say his name, wave a tennis ball around and he always comes running for it. And I’ll play fetch with him to keep him from pestering that other dog. 


Timeouts: If I’m close enough to grab him, I will give him a timeout in my arms until he calms down when he’s being annoying. 




What else could I be doing? How can I help him to make better choices and leave dogs that are uninterested alone? Is this something that might fix itself as he matures?

Hello, My name is Rik and i am 16 years old, I currently live in the Netherlands and i need to do an English exam, Now, For the exam i need to make a poster-presentation thingy about a subject i like. I chose dogs. Now, the problem is that i need to be speaking for about 5 minutes, Currently i have 2.5 minutes and i cant really find anything to add. So i thought that asking native English speakers is a pretty good idea. So, if you'd like to help me out that would mean so much to me. Ill leave the google doc i got down here so you can see what i already got and maybe change/add some things to it, You can than leave it down here or message me on Discord and sent it to me there: DuhItzRik#0909

Please note that English is not my main language so i am not really able to speak a lot of the more ""difficult"" words without making mistakes, So if possible can you use basic English language? (I feel like i am begging for free money or something rn, I know that isn't the case, But this needs to be done before tomorrow evening so i can study it in, I really hope you guys can help me!)

I am happy that you and your dog are a huge fan of our foods. Below is further information for you.

On July 12, 2018, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) issued a brief stating that they were investigating recently reported cases of a type of heart disease known as dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. The brief noted that some dogs who had this disease may have been fed certain types of diets. When researching a health concern, the FDA seeks to provide consumers with periodic updates on their progress. A second update was provided on February 19, 2019. The FDA stated on July 12, 2018, February 19, 2019 and June 27, 2019 that the agency does not advise any dietary changes based solely on the information gathered. Grain-free diets can have many tangible benefits over grain-based foods in general and should not be categorized as a potential concern or problem.

The FDA’s update of June 27, 2019 says it is “continuing to investigate and gather more information in an effort to identify whether there is a specific dietary link to development of DCM.” More specifically, its update provides no causative scientific link between DCM and our products, ingredients or grain-free diets as a whole. We think it is misleading for the FDA to post the names of brands, while at the same time fully stating that they have no scientific evidence linking diet to DCM. We feel this will only serve to further confuse Pet Lovers. The FDA has not provided any scientific data or research on the cause of DCM, or whether or not diet has anything to do with the disease. Research on issues such as this typically take several years to complete.

DCM is a serious but rare condition.  Of note, of the 77 million dogs in the U.S., 0.5% to 1% have DCM, and of those dogs with DCM, less than 0.1% are speculated to have DCM related to diet, although that is not scientifically proven. It is more prevalent in certain breeds, especially many larger dogs. While the cause of DCM is still unknown, it has recently been speculated by some that grain-free foods containing certain carbohydrates could potentially lead to a deficiency of the amino acid taurine in some dogs. Insufficient taurine in the body has been linked to DCM in several species of animals, including dogs. The carbohydrates cited in those reports cover a broad category of ingredients classified as legumes, which includes peas and lentils. In the recipes Champion makes, we emphasize fresh and raw meat with total animal-derived ingredients ranging from 60 to 85 percent of the finished product. Legumes are not a significant feature in Champion's recipes, and never have been.

In dogs, taurine is not an essential amino acid, as they have the ability to make their own. Taurine is synthesized in the dogs’ body, from two essential amino acids, cysteine and methionine. Cats do not have the ability to do this, so taurine is an essential amino acid as they need this amino acid to come from their diet. Taurine is found naturally in muscle meat and organs, as well as significant quantities in sea food. Dogs that have been diagnosed with a taurine deficiency may need a taurine supplement or, potentially a methionine supplement. 

Champion takes seriously our commitment to provide safe pet food that delivers complete and balanced nutrition, and we welcome new information that can help us keep this commitment. In the meantime, we have taken several actions and will continue to do so, which include:

•    We held two long-term feeding trials with enhanced DCM protocols on two different breeds of dogs - Beagles and Labs. We do these trials regularly on all of our diets, but we enhanced these trials to measure taurine levels in blood to see how diet impacted taurine levels over time. Not only did the dogs appear to enjoy the diet, there were no signs of DCM or precursors to DCM after our trials. 
•    We completed studies on starch, fiber, and amino acid in all our diets and found no concerns. 
•    We performed digestibility and bioavailability studies of amino acids on different diets, with positive results.
•    We are actively working internally and with other industry leaders to research and learn more about DCM.
•    Champion has a senior nutrition scientist working with a committee of nutrition experts from other pet food companies who meet regularly to review any DCM developments, research data, and evaluate ideas to continue to study and understand this topic. 
•    We continuously evaluate all nutrients in our dog foods with the goal of constant improvement and evolution of Champion’s recipes. In September 2018, we reformulated and launched our ACANA Singles foods, adding more meat and taurine supplementation to exceed a Champion established minimum.
•    Our Biologically Appropriate foods mission is based on the best available research at any one time, including research into DCM. As more facts become known and accepted, Champion adjusts its foods accordingly with the ultimate goal of creating an ideal or optimal nutrient range for dog foods.

We created the Champion Transparency Council, opening our doors to established independent veterinarians and to pet lovers in the spirit of true openness.

We include peas and lentils for a number of reasons. The nutritional composition of peas and lentils includes complex (low-Glycemic) carbohydrates and essential vitamins and minerals. Peas as an example contain a unique assortment of health-protective phytonutrients and antioxidants which help to promote good health and lower the risk of developing anti-inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis.

We have Taurine information bulletin up on our website and FAQs related to DCM. Here are links for you:

https://www.championpetfoodsfacts.com/dcm-information/. Just look under “Health Questions”.

From our company’s founding, we have worked to source the highest quality ingredients and to source them whenever possible from local suppliers. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build the most sanitary, most state-of-the-art pet food facilities in the world; in fact, our operations surpass most human food production facilities. We make the food ourselves, we don't use contract producers, so you can trust that ACANA and ORIJEN are made in strict accordance to our own recipes from high quality ingredients. And we employ food scientists and nutritionists who hold numerous PhD’s, MSc’s and who, along with our in-house veterinarian, test and research our foods every day. So, if you want to know if you can trust Champion, we ask that you judge us by our actions, not by unproven theories or by what others may say about us. Champion’s goal has always been to make the World’s Best Petfood, and to earn the trust of Pet Lovers everywhere.

If you have any further questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me.

&lt;p&gt;We created the Champion Transparency Council, opening our doors to established independent veterinarians and to pet lovers in the spirit of true openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More info on DCM &lt;a href=""http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;amp;S=0&amp;amp;C=0&amp;amp;A=2496""&gt;http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;amp;S=0&amp;amp;C=0&amp;amp;A=2496&lt;/a&gt;
We include peas and lentils for a number of reasons. The nutritional composition of peas and lentils includes complex (low-Glycemic) carbohydrates and essential vitamins and minerals. Peas as an example contain a unique assortment of health-protective phytonutrients and antioxidants which help to promote good health and lower the risk of developing anti-inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have Taurine information bulletin up on our website and FAQs related to DCM. Here are links for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.championpetfoodsfacts.com/dcm-information/""&gt;https://www.championpetfoodsfacts.com/dcm-information/&lt;/a&gt;. Just look under “Health Questions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our company’s founding, we have worked to source the highest quality ingredients and to source them whenever possible from local suppliers. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build the most sanitary, most state-of-the-art pet food facilities in the world; in fact, our operations surpass most human food production facilities. We make the food ourselves, we don&amp;#39;t use contract producers, so you can trust that ACANA and ORIJEN are made in strict accordance to our own recipes from high quality ingredients. And we employ food scientists and nutritionists who hold numerous PhD’s, MSc’s and who, along with our in-house veterinarian, test and research our foods every day. So, if you want to know if you can trust Champion, we ask that you judge us by our actions, not by unproven theories or by what others may say about us. Champion’s goal has always been to make the World’s Best Petfood, and to earn the trust of Pet Lovers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Long time lerker finally reaching out for some words of wisdom...

I have a four year old (soon to be five) chihuahua. [Igg-Bert](https://i.imgur.com/wqyCIhJ.jpg) He is the light of my life for many reasons. I got home from a breeder as a puppy in 2014 and he’s been my right hand man ever since. Over all, he’s a good boy. He walks well on a leash, doesn’t bark in the car, lets me brush his teeth, and stands patiently in the sink every Sunday for his weekly bath. 

The problem arises whenever a new person comes to my house. Ever since he was a pup, he would bark and bark whenever a stranger entered the door. Eventually he would calm down while my family and I tossed treats and showered him with praise. We thought things were on the up and up, but now he’s moved onto nipping at strangers.

 I feel as though I am a failed pet parent. It’s as though I cannot control my 8.5lb dog. I know it’s my own fault for not working harder to nip this issue in the bud when he was a baby. I hate seeing him so stressed out and upset... not to mention, it’s awful for the new friend who is greeted by this demonic dog. My worst free is that one day I’ll take it too far and harm a child and I’ll be forced to put him down... 

I’m not sure if this has anything to do with it, but he is on a urinary SO diet due to crystals forming in his bladder. I do feed him a smaller portion of food (it’s what the vet recommended because he was becoming a little fatty), so maybe he’s also hangry on top of not liking strangers? I don’t know... I’m grasping at straws. Also, he has two sisters [Hazel](https://i.imgur.com/2Te2TAS.jpg who is 11 months and Evelyn https://i.imgur.com/uJp7TyK.jpg who is a year and and a half (actual sisters, different litters)who are absolute treasures. They’ve never met a person they didn’t love. They greet every stranger with kisses and roll over for belly rubs within seconds. I don’t expect Igg to begin acting like them, any time soon, or even ever, but I hate that he’s become the typical “ankle biting chihuahua.” All people see is the stereotype, when, behind closed doors, he’s an angel. I’m at a loss, really. 

Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance. :’))

We took her in a year ago just before moving.

I’m sure I know the answer, but I can’t even get the vet who claimed she had the numerous ailments to respond back to me. I would like to get my dog back up to 100% as we just had a baby and they have bonded very well and she was also undergoing training to become a service dog for me.

Has the ship sailed? I’m sure it has, just needed someone else to officially shut the door for me.

We moved from a dry southwest state to a humid Midwest state, initial vet thought humidity was playing a factor.

Puppy Bite Inhibition Training:

I recently got a Maltese puppy just about 2 months old (got her when she was a month++ old). This is the first time I've attempted training and raising a puppy and have ran into some issues/doubts about puppy bite inhibition training. I've read up on and watched some tutorials online about biting by puppies and that's a very normal behavior but its important to train the puppy to soften their bites. I've been trying some strategies like providing feedback by saying ""Ouch"" when the bites get too hard and intense but she hasn't been responding at all.

Sources online have told me if that's the case, I should just walk away and leave her be and stop play. However, when I do this, she just ignores me and goes around the house chewing on anything else she can find (we keep her in a crate at night so there isn't a pen she stays in of some sort). Thus I'm not really sure about how much ""stopping play"" is working since thus far, ""Ouch"" as a audio feedback doesn't seem to stimulate any response. Furthermore, sometimes the intense bites are followed by some growls. Is this a normal process of the training or should I seek some professional help?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where does a puppy sleep?:

As I mentioned, for the past few weeks my new puppy has been sleeping in a wire crate. My parents are worried that because she hasn't been properly potty/chew-toy trained, the puppy would go around the house at night chewing and munching on anything she can find as well as peeing/pooping everywhere or worse still, run off and go missing. Thus, we keep her in a crate at night. However, I've recently learnt that this probably isn't the best place for her to sleep/stay at night. Are there any recommendations for this? Thanks in advance guys!

EDIT: I think I typed that entirely wrong. She's around 2 months old now (still pretty young though) but we got her when she was a month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

We have two dogs, one Havanese, one a mix. Both are 14lbs, under the age of 5 and very healthy.

Our dogs were on Bravecto, but it was making one of them sick and the idea of having our dogs ingest poison wasn't sitting well with me. I bought Advantix II because it was recommended by our vet due to our area. (It's flea season here right now) and it appeared this formula covered any fleas, ticks, etc.

Friday afternoon I applied the treatment to both dogs. By 6pm, we noticed both dogs were panting heavily, restless and kept biting at their tails. They both would not lay down but just sit up. By 10p, our Havanese was unable to walk. He would stand for a few seconds, sit, and then flop over. It didn't appear he was having seizures, but it was clear he could not take a few steps. We had to carry him from one spot to the other. He also lost control of his bladder and had several accidents during this time.

I called the emergency vet and was told to wash the product off both dogs and give them 1/2 a tablet of Benadryl each. They also said it would take up to 48 hours for them to recover. We did this and the Benadryl allowed both dogs to sleep that night.

By Saturday morning both dogs were still biting at their tails and still very lethargic. Our Havanese would not respond to treats, any key words that usually got him going or had an appetite. He was still unable to walk and sat up the majority of the day panting. I gave both dogs another round of Benadryl that day and by Sunday afternoon they both appeared back to normal. Our Havanese is still biting at his tail and having these ""twitches"" every now and then but is back to his happy bouncing self playing with his toys.

The vet said this is likely due to a sensitive nervous system but we are now back to trying to find a flea and tick solution they don't have to ingest and will not affect them like the Advantix did. I don't want to resort to the flea collars since both dogs sleep on our bed and are snugglers, and I have a sensitive immune system.

While we were heading over, my dog started retching and eventually threw up twice.  It was thickish and yellow. Didn’t seem to have any bits of food in it. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to investigate further.

After that he seemed normal and was able to start running with me when I realized how late I was. Once inside, I gave him his food and water and had to rush out.

So whenever I’m home ALL the time in the morning to let my puppy out and to feed him in the morning. I’ve been trying to create a schedule for my pupp to sleep all the way until 8am. 

The problem is every Sunday when my mom is home, she lets him out before 8am. Now I believe he’s grown accustom to waking up before and barking for food and to come out. I’ve tried to explain it to my mom time and time again, that schedule is an important thing for a dog but she still doesn’t listen.

She’ll take him out of his crate whenever she’s awake, walk him whenever its convenient for herself and I guarantee will not listen to what I tell her.

It's been a couple of weeks for me to get in the mindset of writing this but I think I'm finally ready to let it all out.

In May, Hershey was having her period. She seemed to have some leaking discharge but we didn't think much of it and attributed it to her period. June 10th came along and it was her 13th birthday! We have a tradition of getting her a small hamburger just for her. She didn't seem to have too much of an appetite but she ate a little bit.

It was around the 17th when we noticed she was losing her appetite. She was a little more lethargic. She was a sassy dog but still pretty low-energy, so we thought maybe her period is making her feel pretty crappy. A few more days pass and she still is refusing to eat. She'd barely drink water unless we brought the bowl to her in bed. At this point we were trying to get some calories in her by filling a syringe with milk. She was so much more still than usual. Her eyes looked so sad.

On Friday the 21st we take her to the vet. Mom, dad, brother, and I. After looking at the x-rays he tells us she has pyometra. We'd never heard of this before. He says we should get her spayed as soon as possible and that should fix everything up. After dropping $600 and knowing we probably couldn't afford to do it there we end up at this 24-hour emergency vet clinic, which in hindsight was a pointless idea. They quoted us $4,000 for the procedure which none of us had. All of us got rejected from the Scratch Pay and Care Credit stuff. I had literally $500 to my name. They were holding Hershey basically hostage in there for about an hour or two until we told them there was no way for us to pay that. We did get some antibiotics from them and she had some IV fluids in her. After getting her back, it was already late, and nothing else was open. 

Saturday was dedicated to researching affordable vets in the area. We're a very low-income family and didn't expect anything like this to happen. Nobody was open on the weekend except the emergency clinics which charged an arm and a leg. My grandma knew of a vet she used to go to years ago who had very affordable prices. On Saturday mom gives them a call and an appointment is scheduled for Monday for Hershey to have a consultation. On Sunday night, mom and Hershey join me in bed as we watch a Marvel movie together. 

Monday comes along. I get out of the shower and, like usual, see Hershey sitting at the edge of the bed in grandma's room looking at me, like any other day. I blow her a kiss as I get ready to leave with her, mom, and dad to the vet. Once we arrive, the waiting room is incredibly small and there are many people there with their dogs. I'm holding her on my lap wrapped in her blanket. Eventually we see the son of the doctor who is a vet himself. He confirms that it's pyometra. He makes note of the various small mammary tumors she has, stating they could be benign, but it's hard to actually tell. 

Soon we get into the talk of surgery. He was a little more ""real"" with us than our other vet. He said it looked like she had jaundice. We thought she was getting better with the antibiotics and stuff but I guess not. He said he'd like to take a blood test first and see if she is suitable to go through with the surgery. We wouldn't know the results until the next day. He also said if the test comes back bad then it might be best to let her go instead of letting her suffer like this with minimal chance of recovery. We agree to the blood test seeing as how losing her was just not an option. A chance is better than no chance. A nurse takes her into the back room and we're back in the waiting room.

Thirty minutes pass. My dad goes outside to the car for a bit and mom is nearby. Soon, the nurse calls for us. The father of the vet we were talking to (it's his clinic and he does the surgeries here) starts talking to us saying we shouldn't wait for the blood test. That it's serious and they should start the operation today. This whole part is a blur but he kept telling us to ""have peace in your heart"" and to ""go home and have peace"". Hershey was siting there on the table. She was looking up at us so sad. We started tearing up. I rubbed her ears a bit and grabbed a tissue. We hug and kiss her. As we start to leave, I turn around again and go back to kiss her little face and neck and I tell her ""I love you, we'll be right back, sweet pea.""

We go to the car and dad's asking us where she is. We tell him they wanted to start right away and that they wanted us to go home, and that they'll call us if anything comes up.

About 40 minutes later we're nearly home and mom gets a call. We pull into the nearest parking lot. Mom gets out of the car to listen. I feel my heart slowing dropping. She gets back in and gives the phone to my dad. She tells us that they said the operation isn't looking too good and that some cancer seems to have metastasized. My dad then hands me the phone looking like he's going to break down. I'm feeling faint and trying to listen to the nurse. She says and no charge they can remove the spleen, but that it's risky and could cause her to bleed, and that things were ""looking pretty grim"". I talk out loud ""the spleen? we could remove it?"" and mom looks like she's far gone. The nurse tells me the other option would be to just let her go to sleep, and it would be peaceful and she wouldn't feel anything. I'm thinking only of the option that has a possibility to save her. Then dad cries out, ""just let her go.""  I tell the nurse, half crying, that we have to let her go then. After that, it's just silence and tears. 

I felt so fucking guilty. Would more money have changed the outcome? I kept re-playing the last moment I saw her. Kissing her face as she watched us leave. Dad didn't even get to have that last moment. My brother was at work all day and my sister was with friends; THEY didn't have their last moment. Or rather, they did, but it was like any other day. You just don't expect that to be the last time. My heart was broken. It still is broken. I weeped for days. My brother and sister did too after telling them. She was always with us. Hershey, for 13 years, had NEVER been sick, never had fleas, never had anything bad to warrant going to the doggy hospital for. It was all so sudden and that's the worst part. Our baby who would cuddle with us every night disappeared out of our lives so fast. 

I had a couple dreams of her that week amidst all the crying. The first one, I hardly recognized her, but she was much younger and full of vitality as mom and I took her for a walk. The second dream I saw her walking on the floor around my bed. She jumps up and rests in her ball-form shape in-between my legs. I remember actually feeling the feeling of her sitting on me.

Last week I stayed at dad's place a while. I couldn't handle going home and feeling the emptiness of her absence. We scheduled a pick-up for her cremation. The girl doing the pick-up was super nice and she asked if we'd like to see her leave with Hershey. I decided against it. I wanted my last vision of her to be kissing her sweet face. On the 30th she was officially cremated and she came to us in a beautiful cedar box with her paw prints inside. 

Sorry this was so long. It was all so sudden and traumatizing. I miss my baby girl every day. It hurts my heart; everyone's hearts. She was very protective. She loved chicken and body massages. Back at home, seeing where she used to be, it pains us. This is our first time grieving for a pet. It's so hard to cope.

RIP Hershey. We'll always love you, sweet pea. &lt;3","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 24th, 2019, our sweet Hershey passed away. It&amp;#39;s been a couple of weeks for me to get in the mindset of writing this but I think I&amp;#39;m finally ready to let it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, Hershey was having her period. She seemed to have some leaking discharge but we didn&amp;#39;t think much of it and attributed it to her period. June 10th came along and it was her 13th birthday! We have a tradition of getting her a small hamburger just for her. She didn&amp;#39;t seem to have too much of an appetite but she ate a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around the 17th when we noticed she was losing her appetite. She was a little more lethargic. She was a sassy dog but still pretty low-energy, so we thought maybe her period is making her feel pretty crappy. A few more days pass and she still is refusing to eat. She&amp;#39;d barely drink water unless we brought the bowl to her in bed. At this point we were trying to get some calories in her by filling a syringe with milk. She was so much more still than usual. Her eyes looked so sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday the 21st we take her to the vet. Mom, dad, brother, and I. After looking at the x-rays he tells us she has pyometra. We&amp;#39;d never heard of this before. He says we should get her spayed as soon as possible and that should fix everything up. After dropping $600 and knowing we probably couldn&amp;#39;t afford to do it there we end up at this 24-hour emergency vet clinic, which in hindsight was a pointless idea. They quoted us $4,000 for the procedure which none of us had. All of us got rejected from the Scratch Pay and Care Credit stuff. I had literally $500 to my name. They were holding Hershey basically hostage in there for about an hour or two until we told them there was no way for us to pay that. We did get some antibiotics from them and she had some IV fluids in her. After getting her back, it was already late, and nothing else was open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was dedicated to researching affordable vets in the area. We&amp;#39;re a very low-income family and didn&amp;#39;t expect anything like this to happen. Nobody was open on the weekend except the emergency clinics which charged an arm and a leg. My grandma knew of a vet she used to go to years ago who had very affordable prices. On Saturday mom gives them a call and an appointment is scheduled for Monday for Hershey to have a consultation. On Sunday night, mom and Hershey join me in bed as we watch a Marvel movie together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday comes along. I get out of the shower and, like usual, see Hershey sitting at the edge of the bed in grandma&amp;#39;s room looking at me, like any other day. I blow her a kiss as I get ready to leave with her, mom, and dad to the vet. Once we arrive, the waiting room is incredibly small and there are many people there with their dogs. I&amp;#39;m holding her on my lap wrapped in her blanket. Eventually we see the son of the doctor who is a vet himself. He confirms that it&amp;#39;s pyometra. He makes note of the various small mammary tumors she has, stating they could be benign, but it&amp;#39;s hard to actually tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we get into the talk of surgery. He was a little more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; with us than our other vet. He said it looked like she had jaundice. We thought she was getting better with the antibiotics and stuff but I guess not. He said he&amp;#39;d like to take a blood test first and see if she is suitable to go through with the surgery. We wouldn&amp;#39;t know the results until the next day. He also said if the test comes back bad then it might be best to let her go instead of letting her suffer like this with minimal chance of recovery. We agree to the blood test seeing as how losing her was just not an option. A chance is better than no chance. A nurse takes her into the back room and we&amp;#39;re back in the waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes pass. My dad goes outside to the car for a bit and mom is nearby. Soon, the nurse calls for us. The father of the vet we were talking to (it&amp;#39;s his clinic and he does the surgeries here) starts talking to us saying we shouldn&amp;#39;t wait for the blood test. That it&amp;#39;s serious and they should start the operation today. This whole part is a blur but he kept telling us to &amp;quot;have peace in your heart&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;go home and have peace&amp;quot;. Hershey was siting there on the table. She was looking up at us so sad. We started tearing up. I rubbed her ears a bit and grabbed a tissue. We hug and kiss her. As we start to leave, I turn around again and go back to kiss her little face and neck and I tell her &amp;quot;I love you, we&amp;#39;ll be right back, sweet pea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go to the car and dad&amp;#39;s asking us where she is. We tell him they wanted to start right away and that they wanted us to go home, and that they&amp;#39;ll call us if anything comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 40 minutes later we&amp;#39;re nearly home and mom gets a call. We pull into the nearest parking lot. Mom gets out of the car to listen. I feel my heart slowing dropping. She gets back in and gives the phone to my dad. She tells us that they said the operation isn&amp;#39;t looking too good and that some cancer seems to have metastasized. My dad then hands me the phone looking like he&amp;#39;s going to break down. I&amp;#39;m feeling faint and trying to listen to the nurse. She says and no charge they can remove the spleen, but that it&amp;#39;s risky and could cause her to bleed, and that things were &amp;quot;looking pretty grim&amp;quot;. I talk out loud &amp;quot;the spleen? we could remove it?&amp;quot; and mom looks like she&amp;#39;s far gone. The nurse tells me the other option would be to just let her go to sleep, and it would be peaceful and she wouldn&amp;#39;t feel anything. I&amp;#39;m thinking only of the option that has a possibility to save her. Then dad cries out, &amp;quot;just let her go.&amp;quot;  I tell the nurse, half crying, that we have to let her go then. After that, it&amp;#39;s just silence and tears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so fucking guilty. Would more money have changed the outcome? I kept re-playing the last moment I saw her. Kissing her face as she watched us leave. Dad didn&amp;#39;t even get to have that last moment. My brother was at work all day and my sister was with friends; THEY didn&amp;#39;t have their last moment. Or rather, they did, but it was like any other day. You just don&amp;#39;t expect that to be the last time. My heart was broken. It still is broken. I weeped for days. My brother and sister did too after telling them. She was always with us. Hershey, for 13 years, had NEVER been sick, never had fleas, never had anything bad to warrant going to the doggy hospital for. It was all so sudden and that&amp;#39;s the worst part. Our baby who would cuddle with us every night disappeared out of our lives so fast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a couple dreams of her that week amidst all the crying. The first one, I hardly recognized her, but she was much younger and full of vitality as mom and I took her for a walk. The second dream I saw her walking on the floor around my bed. She jumps up and rests in her ball-form shape in-between my legs. I remember actually feeling the feeling of her sitting on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I stayed at dad&amp;#39;s place a while. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle going home and feeling the emptiness of her absence. We scheduled a pick-up for her cremation. The girl doing the pick-up was super nice and she asked if we&amp;#39;d like to see her leave with Hershey. I decided against it. I wanted my last vision of her to be kissing her sweet face. On the 30th she was officially cremated and she came to us in a beautiful cedar box with her paw prints inside. &lt;/p&gt;

I will try to describe situation as well as I can, focusing on the point.

My girlfriend has a dog for 5 years, 2 years ago she moved to another city and the dog was living with my gf's mother and another dog that they were good friends with (second dog was bought when the first one was 1 year old). They both are Yorkshire Terriers.

A bit about our doggie: he is a chubby guy, really calm and smart. He listens to all commands carefully and understands how to behave even from a look (he even listens to me, even though he knows me for less than a year and we met only a few times!). Although he is known to be a bit manipulative, like acting hurt or sad to get more attention. For example, he would stop walking if he had a leaf tangled in his fur. Seriously.

Yesterday we decided to bring him to our home, which is around 300km away. He was really happy to go, it seems he realised that he is going with us when we left my gf's mother's place. Point number one: he is really afraid of being in a car because earlier car rides were only for a vet's visit. Okay, so the trip was a bit scary for him, tongue out and intense breathing most of the trip, but we stopped to take a walk a few times, most of the part he was in my gf's arms or sleeping in his fluffy house on the backseat.

When we came home, he slowly began to feel better. He really enjoyed the evening walk since the environment is very green and natural, he smelled every flower and overall seemed very happy. Inside, he followed us all the time, even if me or my gf went to the toilet, he scratched the doors and squealed. He slept in our bed during the night and slept really calmly next to my gf. We also played a bit in the evening and in the morning to get him tired (he doesn't need much time to play, gets exhausted in 10-15 minutes).

But this morning was THE FIRST TIME HE WAS LEFT HOME ALONE. For the last 4 years, he at least had a dog friend with him. My gf's mother works long hours and both doggies were totally ok to stay by themselves for 10 hours every day.

But now, sheesh, the drama... He loves my gf very much and when she left to work, he started to mildly shake and squeal like... I cannot even describe it, the view was heartbreaking. He would sniff through the bottom of the door and scratch it with his palm. My gf told me to talk a lot with him but try to be more strict and talk in a calm, but not sensitive, voice, saying things like ""It's going to be all right, we are just going for work, we will be back soon"". He understands the keywords like ""work"", ""back soon"". And he would calm down. For 15 seconds. Then it would repeat. I tried to play with him, pet him, hold him in my arms, give him some snacks - only holding him in my arms helped him to calm down a bit.

Then it was my time to leave for work. He wanted to rush through the doors to look for his owner. I stopped him and told him to stay there and protect the house, he listened. I closed the door, locked it and heard him squealing again. He would bark a few times too. I stopped to listen outside of our house and came to check the sound outside back and forth from my car, eventually he stopped barking. I then drove to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give us any advice, how to handle this situation? It seems like he experienced a lot of stress in a 24 hour period... We really want him to stay with us and we love our dog a lot. We decided to give him a week try-out at our place and if he is not ok - we would get him back to my gf's mother place. If the next morning will be the same, we might take a day off and drive him back this Wednesday. But I am not sure how patient we should be, how can we help him. He is a really smart dog and was always independant in terms of being without people for the day. I've read through the post again and it seems like I am being overly dramatic a bit. But it's really important to us. Should I drive home in a couple of hours to check him out or would that make matters even worse?

Another important thing is that we live in a flat that doesn't have a great sound isolation. After work, I am going to ask my neighbours (a nice couple of retired old people that we don't know well) if our dog barked a lot or made any other loud noises. If he is going to be really noisy, we will have to get him home no matter what because we might get a visit from the police.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, reddit, I really need your advice.

Recently I had a slight incident at a dog park which I wondered what would be the appropriate course of action. 

We've been to this dog park numerous times and so far my dog has had no problems getting along with any dog there. So this time we arrived and there was another owner and dog already there. I haven't seen them before. 

We entered the dog park, and I kept my dog on leash to ensure I had control until he was completely comfortable and friendly towards the other dog. The other dog comes over to greet him, and starts licking my dogs groin.

My dog doesn't like this at all, and he starts growling a bit and his back hairs start to stand. So I decide to pull him away and go to another part of the park. The other dog wasn't leashed and kept following us, and the owner was trying very hard to recall her dog but wasn't successful. The other dog kept on trying to lick, and my dog started barking and snarling.

I kept them as separate as possible until the owner leashed her dog and left the dog park.

Should I have left the park? The reason I stayed on was to try to get both dogs acclimatised to each other but I feel like I ended up disrupting someone else's time at the park.

Sorry in advance if I didn't do the right thing.

Edit: thanks for the responses! I never realized leashing my dog around other unleashed dogs would cause problems. My bad. The advice here is fully appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I got him as a puppy from a rescue while I was still in college. We have been through several moves living in 6 different apartments over those 4 years or so. 5 really since one was only a few weeks until the complex put me in the correct apartment. So 5 or 6 basically though. Now I'm starting a new job that's about 30 minutes from my parents house. I talked with them and we did some math to figure out I can buy a house in about 4 months if I save up my salary for the down payment. But that means living with them for that time. I figured it would be better to get my own house in 4 months than sign a year log lease somewhere if I didn't need it. 

It's been maybe 5 days and I'm regretting it. 

First off, my dog (GSD mix) has been anxious. I know the fireworks don't help but even during the day or late at night he seems to be heavy panting and anxious.

He isn't eating. I ask him if he's hungry and he goes to his bowl and I fill it and he will sniff it and leave. Or just lay down near it. But doesn't eat. And a few hours later he still doesn't want to eat. Today he had only 1 cup instead of his usual 2 because he didn't eat dinner. So I'm worried he's going to puke bile from the empty stomach tomorrow. And add on the panting? No bueno. 

Then there's the part that hurt tonight. And I don't know if it's because it's late or what. He has always been a room sleeper with me. I take him to my room for bed and he sleeps on the floor or sometimes will fall asleep on the bed and when I wake up he is on the floor. Any time I get up in the night he has always been tired and just kind of looks at me to make sure I'm not leaving forever when I go to the bathroom. Tonight I got up and opened the door and when I went back he was in my parents room on the floor. I feel hurt. I tried to call him but he just sat there panting and ignored me. 

I don't know how to help him feel less anxiety for a few months. I thought it was the negative energy from my parents being yellers (they just yell to each other instead of walking to ask questions. Drives me nuts) but if that was the cause of the anxiety why would he choose to lay on their floor? 

I've never been unsure of things with him but idk where to go. Do I need to just move out and get him his own space again?

Today I adopted a 9 week old Chihuahua from my local humane society. I just finished my first year of graduate school and after finishing the last set of kitten shots for a kitten I rescued (found him stray in the forest at 6 weeks old), I decided it was an okay time to start LOOKING at possibly adopting a dog. I wanted to get a puppy before my kitten got too much older (he's 17 weeks) and when I looked online I fell in love with this Chihuahua mix. I have all of the financial resources I need to take care of him (he already has all the materials he needs, pet insurance, and an appointment with a vet in my city for this week) but there is one small issue.

I am moving out of my current house on 7/31, visiting my parent for two weeks, and then moving into a new house on 8/15. So essentially, I am moving TWICE in one month. I know this isn't ideal for a puppy (or young cat/kitten) but the puppy needed to be adopted today because the foster mom was moving, and I knew I would never get another chance at finding a small breed puppy at my local shelters.

So, my question is: what can I do to make this situation as stress free for my babies as possible? I know sticking to a stick potty/eat/play schedule is an obvious start, but is there anything else I can do? My vet told me that such a young puppy should be able to adapt really well, and that the new environment in tandem with the normal schedule/training could actually be beneficial in terms of socialization, but I don't want to overwhelm him.

Any and all advice is appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I live next to an elderly couple and while walking my dog today my neighbor approached me and told me he needs me to get my Eurasier to stop barking. 

I'd be happy to do that, if my dog were a problem barker. But she's not. At all. 

I was confused and asked what he meant. My dog (like any dog) isn't silent 100% of the time, but she is by no means an obnoxious dog. She barks when someone approaches the house or the yard, but it doesn't last long. Definitely under a minute every time. She barks when she wants to come inside. She barks a bit when she's playing with her brother. I'd say she's quiet 95% of the time. 

After asking him to explain the issue he was having, he said that she barks when he goes out to his lawn. This is true, she barks to say 'hey, I see you!' but again - it never lasts. She's also never outside for very long without my direct supervision - maybe 15-20 minutes tops if it's a nice day and I'm always within earshot inside, so I know for a fact she's not going on at length without my knowledge. 

After asking clarifying questions he got frustrated and said ""I'm 80 years old, I'm going to die soon, and I never want to hear a dog bark again!"" 

I was totally baffled. I apologized for inconveniencing him and said expecting a dog to never bark is like expecting a human to never talk. He replied by saying the dogs down the street bark constantly and it's despicable. It was such a bizarre interaction. I ended the conversation by saying I'd do my best to bring her in if I notice him outside, but I can't guarantee she'll never bark again. I don't know where to go from here. 

I don't think it's possible to train my dog out of this and honestly, I don't want to. I like it when she barks to alert me of someone approaching the house - especially if this happens when I'm not expecting it. 

Has anyone else experienced a neighbor like this? Anything I can do to help the situation beyond avoiding him?

He replied by saying the dogs down the street bark constantly and it&amp;#39;s despicable. It was such a bizarre interaction. I ended the conversation by saying I&amp;#39;d do my best to bring her in if I notice him outside, but I can&amp;#39;t guarantee she&amp;#39;ll never bark again. I don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s possible to train my dog out of this and honestly, I don&amp;#39;t want to. I like it when she barks to alert me of someone approaching the house - especially if this happens when I&amp;#39;m not expecting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced a neighbor like this? Anything I can do to help the situation beyond avoiding him? I want to be a good neighbor and part of me is paranoid someone who is this intolerant of dogs might do something nasty to her. I just want to have a copacetic relationship with my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

I've taken my dog to the emergency vet last night due to him trying to be super man and jumped off the 2nd floor of my apartment. We've just rescued him from the Humane Society and did the insurance online so if anything were to happen it would be covered and now that this happened they want a large 500 down payment + the fees for what ever needs to be done such as X-Rays, meds and so on. We came up with around 340 of the money but they want it all or nothing is there anything we can do for this problem?

His back right leg and front right leg are hurt but he tries to stand and walk. He will crawl around the house to get to his food water and us. At times he cries and times he just stays there not making noise. We have meds for him that we got from the vet but don't seem to work. He's American Bulldog and Pitbull also deaf. We are out of ideas and feel like we are at a loss on what to do.

My husband and daughter will be driving in a u-haul, and I will be driving our car with Rudy, our dog. 

When we first took him home (he was 10 weeks), we had to travel 6 hours and he did well. Since then, he’s been in the car multiple times but never over an hour. He likes the car and usually just lays down on the backseat. 

Does anyone have any tips/advice for how to make this long drive as pleasant for us both as possible? I’m planning on stopping every 2 or so hours for a bathroom break and a quick walk to stretch our legs but would love to know what else I can do.

I was having a bad day at work, and went to visit some of the dogs at the local shelter on my lunch break. I ended up sending $150 to my girlfriend (now fiancé) to rescue this little old lady and buy her everything she needs. 

She was pretty bad off. Had been in the shelter for six weeks. Previous owners dropped her off because she got old and boring (their words). Fur was ugly and she was definitely way too skinny (49 lbs). We took her to the vet immediately and found a few problems. They figured she was between 9-11 years old. Chronic ear infection. Severe arthritis. Allergic to grass. Deaf in both ears. We nursed her back to health as best as we could. She’s weighing in now at 67 lbs and her coat is great, no patches or irritated skin.  The ear infection hasn’t ever fully gone away. We treat it and it always comes back, same ear. The arthritis has steadily gotten worse. 

We’ve tried her on pain medication but it doesn’t seem to help her mobility. We use to do walks around our apartment complex (maybe a quarter mile?) but now she can’t even make it around the gym (about 50 yards). She falls pretty regularly. Sometimes she struggles to stand back up and I’ve got to help. After our walk she has a noticeable limp and her breathing is very heavy. She’s got a weird cough/pant that shows up every few days. 

She sleeps most of the day, and doesn’t wine or complain of pain in any way. Never interested in standing up or playing, but she always finds herself at the dinner table if there’s food around. No loss of appetite or struggles going to the bathroom. She’d stay in bed until the afternoon if I’d let her before she needed to go out. 

We know her quality of life has gone down over the last two years, we’re just not sure if it’s her time yet. She’s definitely a grandma of a dog. We’ve given her an amazing few years. Are we being selfish? She’s my best friend and is the first dog I’ve ever had.

We got him as a puppy at 8 weeks and have done all the training things with him and he is a very good dog. When he was younger he never had any behavioural problems, he was very friendly/excited when people would come to the house, he wasn't scared at all in the puppy training class etc. 

I think the issue started after we brought him to a kennel for the weekend, he was there for 2 nights and when we picked him up it was obvious that he was not happy in his surroundings. Ever since then we have noticed a change in his behaviour around others. He does not like meeting strangers, he gets very scared when people come to the house, he barks a lot and tries to runaway/hide. He still loves other dogs, but on walks if people try and approach him he is visibly scared, he backs away and wants nothing to do with them. If we are walking him in a busy/crowded area he pulls on his leash to try to get away from the situation. We've brought him to family bbqs and events and he appears very overwhelmed with the amount of strangers and is just clearly upset. This has been really hard for us and I feel absolutely terrible, it's pretty clear he wasn't treated the best while he stayed in the kennel. 

So we have tried to google solutions to this and all we could find is that you need to continuously expose him to what he is scared of (people) while giving him treats, starting on a small basis and working your way up. Now this is a good idea in theory however we are having trouble executing it. Its hard to have people come over to the house on a regular basis who he doesn't already know, and taking him out into a crowded area doesn't seem like a great idea because I don't want to traumatize him further and make the situation worse. 

I've heard of anti-anxiety medication you can give to dogs (the vet suggested it before we bring him in) and I was wondering if we gave him some of that before bringing him around people - it might help him relax and then see there's nothing to be scared of and then be more calm without the medication? 

He has never been aggressive to anyone and he is a very sweet boy, but I'm worried it could progress to that if it gets worse. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions for helping with this?

&lt;p&gt;So we have tried to google solutions to this and all we could find is that you need to continuously expose him to what he is scared of (people) while giving him treats, starting on a small basis and working your way up. Now this is a good idea in theory however we are having trouble executing it. Its hard to have people come over to the house on a regular basis who he doesn&amp;#39;t already know, and taking him out into a crowded area doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a great idea because I don&amp;#39;t want to traumatize him further and make the situation worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard of anti-anxiety medication you can give to dogs (the vet suggested it before we bring him in) and I was wondering if we gave him some of that before bringing him around people - it might help him relax and then see there&amp;#39;s nothing to be scared of and then be more calm without the medication? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has never been aggressive to anyone and he is a very sweet boy, but I&amp;#39;m worried it could progress to that if it gets worse. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions for helping with this? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Health history: she's got some arthritis in her spine and her wonderful vet has got her on a couple of doggie drugs and we added in some nice glucosamine. The arthritis is unfortunately right where her colon sits so when her colon is full, she doesn't exactly realize it and lets just say we've invested in some hefty floor cleaners in the last year. Couple of seizures here and there in the last few years but they're mild and monitored heavily.

That aside, in the last two weeks or so it's been pretty hot here in the midwest, and she would rather be outside all day every day. We check on her frequently, and I always find her hanging out in the shade, and lately even though (we think) she pulled a muscle, she's been trotting along the fence line having the time of her little life. Here's the thing, she has a doggy door so she can go in and out at will. We've been actually coaxing her to come inside and hang out with us in the AC with snacks and snuggles, but she prefers the back yard. We have a fun little deck with a deck couch that she loves, so we're wondering if she just....likes to watch and listen (big farmland behind our property). It's also crossed my mind that maybe she is getting ready to go, and is living out her last days in nature to...reconnect maybe? Could this be her way of letting us know? IDK, anyone got any ideas as to what is going on in that stubborn little noggin of hers? She's not very good at using her words when I ask her.

And if anyone does have experience with such a situation, and it was your dog's way of saying goodbye, please don't hold back, let me know.

The arthritis is unfortunately right where her colon sits so when her colon is full, she doesn&amp;#39;t exactly realize it and lets just say we&amp;#39;ve invested in some hefty floor cleaners in the last year. Couple of seizures here and there in the last few years but they&amp;#39;re mild and monitored heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, in the last two weeks or so it&amp;#39;s been pretty hot here in the midwest, and she would rather be outside all day every day. We check on her frequently, and I always find her hanging out in the shade, and lately even though (we think) she pulled a muscle, she&amp;#39;s been trotting along the fence line having the time of her little life. Here&amp;#39;s the thing, she has a doggy door so she can go in and out at will. We&amp;#39;ve been actually coaxing her to come inside and hang out with us in the AC with snacks and snuggles, but she prefers the back yard. We have a fun little deck with a deck couch that she loves, so we&amp;#39;re wondering if she just....likes to watch and listen (big farmland behind our property). It&amp;#39;s also crossed my mind that maybe she is getting ready to go, and is living out her last days in nature to...reconnect maybe? Could this be her way of letting us know? IDK, anyone got any ideas as to what is going on in that stubborn little noggin of hers? She&amp;#39;s not very good at using her words when I ask her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if anyone does have experience with such a situation, and it was your dog&amp;#39;s way of saying goodbye, please don&amp;#39;t hold back, let me know. We&amp;#39;ve had a few close calls with her already and are aware that she&amp;#39;s an old gal - our play is to just give her the best rest of her life that we can :&lt;/p&gt;

He tells you when he wants to go out, when he wants in, never shits in the house unless there&amp;#39;s nobody here and he&amp;#39;s pressed, doesn&amp;#39;t attack humans. He just sleeps all day and loves going for walks. And he&amp;#39;s very loving. We&amp;#39;ve never had problems with him before.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope I'm at the right subreddit for this, brace yourselves, this won't be a cheery thing.

So, we've had our (first) dog for 14 years now and time is taking its toll. Our beloved Wheaten terrier Cara is having trouble getting up, seems to be in pain and, to make things worse, it looks like she has a fairly big tumor at her hip (think golfball sized). Evidently, time has come to spare her further pain. While I see that putting her down soon is necessary and the right thing to do, it absolutely breaks my heart. Nonetheless, I will go to the vet to be with her for the last moments, even though this absolutely terrifies me.

I was lucky this far to never having had to deal with the death of someone close to me and having to go to the vet to let her go makes things even worse (I think?). I have absolutely no experience in dealing with death and mourning and I don't know how well I'll be able to handle this.

Not to mention they were double the cost.... about $200 per class compared to $100 or so.

&amp;#x200B;

So I turned to Petco. They offered so many more time slots, dates, etc. They are also in walking distance so I could attend weekday classes a few hours after work and not just wait for a weekend time slot. I watched my trainer interact with her clients and stopped by a few times during classes and puppy socials. I liked what I saw so I decided to buy a package for 2 puppy classes and our AKC Star Puppy Test.

Now I will say that since **it is a chain it will vary depending on the location, staff, etc**. I do recognize that some pet store training facilities can get ignorant trainers or people who are just complete idiots and not dog savvy. This is why I watched ours before I decided to sign on and I encourage others to do so if contemplating these types of basic classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I love our classes and our trainer. In about 2 weeks we will graduate from Puppy 1. Kirin has learned so much and enjoyed every minute of it. We have learned tons of things, sit, down, paw, come, stand, accept stranger pets, handling, etc. **My trainer has also been very accepting of my views on certain things** **since I am raising a show puppy**. She helped me alter the stand a little, she will help me work on a nicer LLW for in the ring and out of the ring, she doesn't question why I use a martingale after I explained how my dog will not be on a harness due to many altering gait.We also happened to not have any other puppies enrolled in our session. So we have been getting really nice one on one time for the price of group classes. This has been great because we really iron out details and work on more challenging things or reinforce things we have been working on.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think a pet store class is the end of the world if you have a puppy or an adult dog that just needs the basics, house manners, etc. It is good socialization, positive, and gives them a challenging environment to work in.

&amp;#x200B;

I do think that if you have a dog with severe behavioral issues, reactivity, aggression, etc. **Then they should be seen by more specialized trainer or behaviorist, and not your every day pet store trainer.**

&amp;#x200B;

So if you are like me and have limited time, options, or transportation and your only option is a pet store trainer then go watch them work. See if you like them and their style and determine where to go from there.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we have all contemplated where to take training classes.

I'm posting here today looking for hope. 

**Tl;dr**: our 1yo female small breed mix is terrified and mistrustful of my husband, despite professional help from a certified dog trainer and daily interactions with him (feeding her, lots of treats, walks, training, etc...). When he's not around, she's a happy-go-lucky dog that's open and playful and curious. When husband is home, she becomes fearful, withdrawn, and passive-aggressive. Trainer said that in cases like these, all we can do is give it time. Online articles say the same. But I have yet to hear of a success story from people suffering similar problems. If you had to deal with this, or knew someone who did, how long did it take for the dog to accept that loved one? 

**Full story:** On May 23rd, we adopted a small breed mix from a local shelter. She's a girl that was aged at approximately 1 year, and had just been spayed. We believe she has some chihuahua mixed with something else. The shelter informed us that she came from a home packed with ten other dogs, and she hadn't been properly socialized. It was evident that she was a shy dog lacking in confidence. I had some reservations, but my husband and son (who is 5 years old) were all for her, so we decided to adopt her. We named her Gabriel.

What the shelter wasn't aware of, was that Gabriel was especially fearful of MEN. The shelter had nothing but female employees and volunteers so they couldn't have realized this. My husband is a tall, slim white man with short cropped hair, glasses. He has what I like to think of as a ""carrying"" voice, rather than a ""loud"" voice. He even has acid reflux that causes him to give out this frequent deep burps that almost sound like growls. There really isn't anything he can do about that as it's a condition he takes medication for.

The first week, I endeavored to make Gabriel feel safe at ease with me and my son. I work nights part time and my husband works days full time, so there wasn't a lot of time I could facilitate a relationship between Gabby and my husband. There were definitely bumps here and there-- she had potty accidents in the house and she had a tendency to lunge or snap at my son. Sometimes she'd chase our cat too, but that stopped after the first month. We crate trained her from day 1, and it took her a few weeks before she could go through the night without barking and howling. I had my son do training with her, and eventually she came to be more friendly and tolerant around him. She bonded with me almost immediately. As for her behavior with my husband? She would cower and flee whenever he came near. When he came home, she'd growl at him unprovoked (he wouldn't be near her, or looking at her)

At the start of the second week, while I was at work, I forgot to leave the leash on the dog so that my husband could safely handle her and take her out for potty breaks. He was forced to try to touch her with his hands to secure the leash, and she flipped out on him, biting him on both hands enough to draw blood on multiple places. He reacted with surprise, shoving her away forcefully and shouting. Then he tried to console her later, only to learn that he might have reinforced her fear. I was devastated, but my husband insisted that we not give up on the dog. He apologized for maybe not taking my warnings about being cautious and attentive to her body language seriously. (This said, I don't really know what else he could have done except to try to corral the dog back into her crate so she wouldn't make a mess in the house.) 

The next day, I made an appointment with a certified dog trainer. That Friday, she came to our home and gave us some exercises to try to get Gabby's confidence up and to get her more comfortable with my husband. These included the basic commands of ""sit"" and ""lay down"", but she also had us do an exercise where we try to get the dog to look us in the eyes, then give her a treat. She gave us clickers to use while we trained her.

From that day on, my husband did his best, and I tried to be as helpful as I could without interfering too much. Our consistency hasn't always been perfect, but my husband is doing so much. He wasn't the one who wanted a dog, I was, and yet now he's shouldering this challenge of getting her to relax around him. I encourage and remind him to work with her every day. He's exceptionally patient with her most of the time, considering how slow her ""progress"" has been. The ""eyes"" exercise has fallen to the wayside, as have the clickers. But he is still the only that feeds her, and whenever he's home, he gives her lots of treats while he pets her.

She can kinda sit on the couch with him now. She'll tolerate him picking her up sometimes if I'm home, but not when I'm not home. She's still being stubborn when my husband tries to make her sit for her food but if he waits her out she'll eventually do it. She refuses to play if he's home. She still growls at him from time to time, and she'll even try to nip his fingers every once in a while when he tries to pick her up or move her bodily. Of course, she still flees from him as if he's going to eat her whenever he first comes home or wakes up in the weekends. It's like she has to get used to him being in her space all over again.

I realize Gabriel isn't the worst case ever, but this has been very upsetting and challenging all the same. Weekends have become tense as a good portion of our day finds itself centered on just trying to get the dog to interact and relax with my husband. I've always wanted a dog, and this experience has been rather unpleasant. I fear what the dog will be like during the winter when we're snowed in, and it'll be more challenging to get her properly exercised. For this reason, I've decided she has till the start of September to show noticeable improvement in her relationship with my husband. I don't need her to be perfect, but I'd like to see her growling and biting stop. If not, I'm afraid we'll be returning her to the shelter. I realize that some of you may find this unfair or disagreeable, but please understand-- we wanted a family dog that EVERYONE could be safe with. I believe wholeheartedly in pets as family members who deserve every effort to be cared for, but the truth of it is, this dog feels like a stranger in our home so long as she keeps rejecting my husband. Rather than draw out what could be a traumatic experience for all of us, I think I'd like to give Gabby ample time to find a new family before winter. If this doesn't work out, I honestly don't know if I'll have it in me to get a new dog ever again.

What is especially difficult for me to see is whenever my mother-in-law or father-in-law visit. For two weekends, we left Gabriel in their care because we went on trips, and somehow my father-in-law not only got her to accept him, but practically adore him. This was just after five days when the only thing she wanted to do with father-in-law was cower and nip his fingers. This is part of the reason she has till September to accept my husband. I know she's capable of changing and accepting a man she was deathly afraid of, and my husband is making a big effort. 

 My husband has been nothing but sweet to her for the last month and a half, and she still acts like he's the anti-christ. She's more at ease with my in-laws than she is with us, and it feels almost unfair. I can only chalk it up to some trait of my husband that my father-in-law lacks, and of course there was the unfortunate biting incident early on. But because of her stubborn refusal to trust him, it feels like she'll never become a part of our family. I have to stop myself from getting too upset every time she reacts negatively to my husband, but it's hard. I've wanted a dog all my life, and now that I have one this has been anything but fun.

SO! /r/dogs, I'm coming to you hoping that some can share success stories of getting fearful dogs to accept loved ones. How long did it take you? What did you do? I'm glad to hear of any new tips or advice, but please keep in mind the things we're already doing. (walks, feeding, training, treats)

I know dog parks can be problematic for a plethora of reasons, but our 3 year old 60-lb. girl absolutely loves the dog park and thrives there. She doesn’t have a mean bone in her body, LOVES meeting new dogs, and lives to be chased. She lives with two cats at home and loves my parents’ chihuahua. We are at the park 3-5x a week and rarely encounter issues. We’ve been lucky with mostly good experiences at the dog park so far.

The big dog area is typically more crowded than the small dog area, and for that reason people often wander over with their smaller dogs to let them socialize. This is normally fine, but today a clueless gentleman brought his ten-pound dog over, immediately popped her down on the ground and watched as (naturally) all the dogs ran over to greet her, my girl being one of them. As expected, the dog got jostled around by the larger dogs, none of whom were being aggressive, just excited and much larger. For 15 minutes, he huffed and made comments to anyone within earshot that his dog kept getting “rolled like a bowling ball” while continuing to pick her up when she was overwhelmed then immediately putting her back down. Though the dogs got bored after a couple minutes and went about their business, she clearly was not comfortable or trying to play, just cowering under his feet until he eventually got tired of complaining and left.

Not a single dog showed a sign of aggression, growled, or physically hurt the small dog, they did what all the dogs do ANYTIME a “new” dog enters the dog park, they greeted and hopped around and had a couple zoomies that the smaller dog couldn’t keep up with. 

For the love of God, WHY would you choose to put your dog in a potentially dangerous situation just because you want them to play with other dogs? Not only is it irresponsible as a dog owner to plop your dog down in a pack of 10+ dogs that outweigh it by 40+ pounds, but it’s the entitlement that really frustrated me. If we come to the dog park and there are only other dogs in the small dog area, I don’t join them, I engage my dog in 1:1 play until she’s tired and if she’s not feeling it, we leave. I don’t put her (or the other dogs and their owners, for that matter) in an uncomfortable or inappropriate situation that could result in accidental injuries.

Please, please make responsible decisions for your dogs. If you want to try out the larger park, go for it. But if your dog is unable to keep up with the larger dogs or clearly not enjoying itself, please leave. Read the room. Take them for a walk instead, play with them yourself, or cut your losses and come back another day. Don’t be so oblivious that you ruin everyone’s time and blame everyone but yourself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, PLEASE keep your dog in the appropriate side of the dog park for their size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know dog parks can be problematic for a plethora of reasons, but our 3 year old 60-lb. girl absolutely loves the dog park and thrives there. She doesn’t have a mean bone in her body, LOVES meeting new dogs, and lives to be chased. She lives with two cats at home and loves my parents’ chihuahua. We are at the park 3-5x a week and rarely encounter issues. We’ve been lucky with mostly good experiences at the dog park so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big dog area is typically more crowded than the small dog area, and for that reason people often wander over with their smaller dogs to let them socialize. This is normally fine, but today a clueless gentleman brought his ten-pound dog over, immediately popped her down on the ground and watched as (naturally) all the dogs ran over to greet her, my girl being one of them. As expected, the dog got jostled around by the larger dogs, none of whom were being aggressive, just excited and much larger. For 15 minutes, he huffed and made comments to anyone within earshot that his dog kept getting “rolled like a bowling ball” while continuing to pick her up when she was overwhelmed then immediately putting her back down. Though the dogs got bored after a couple minutes and went about their business, she clearly was not comfortable or trying to play, just cowering under his feet until he eventually got tired of complaining and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single dog showed a sign of aggression, growled, or physically hurt the small dog, they did what all the dogs do ANYTIME a “new” dog enters the dog park, they greeted and hopped around and had a couple zoomies that the smaller dog couldn’t keep up with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the love of God, WHY would you choose to put your dog in a potentially dangerous situation just because you want them to play with other dogs? Not only is it irresponsible as a dog owner to plop your dog down in a pack of 10+ dogs that outweigh it by 40+ pounds, but it’s the entitlement that really frustrated me. If we come to the dog park and there are only other dogs in the small dog area, I don’t join them, I engage my dog in 1:1 play until she’s tired and if she’s not feeling it, we leave.

Although I still stand firmly behind that decision, we are still paying off the debts from that. Since then, he has had multiple other growths which had to be removed. The first was benign, but for a more recent removal, the biopsy came back positive for cancer again. I took that news in stride and figured we'd just keep him comfortable for as long as possible. However, while I thought we were done for a while, it seems not even a couple weeks after his most recent procedure, he has another growth on his rear right paw/leg. It looks very similar to the one we already removed, so i have to assume it's cancerous as well.

I want to get it removed, but I simply can't afford to anymore. Even the last procedure to get the growths on his neck removed (plus some unrelated dental work) was really hard on me, and I'm still feeling the financial impact and will be for a while. I don't know how i can possibly pay for another procedure so soon, in my current position.

I can't stand the thought of having him suffer like this. His mobility has severely decreased, and he has a lot of trouble moving up and down the stairs in our apartment. His general mood has been much worse as well too. It pains me so much to see this, and feel like i can't do anything about it, but i can't stand the thought of putting him down for what should be a manageable condition. I have no fantasies about the future of Max. I know i will have to put him down sooner or later, given his medical history and propensity for growths. But i was expecting that to be once he had signs of internal issues, not something ""superficial"" which could be easily removed, if only i could afford it. We have xrays from his most recent procedure and he had zero signs of growth on his internal organs. He had an intrusion into his chest cavity, but at the moment it isn't impeding his breath or health.

I just really don't know what to do here. I don't want to put him down before 'it's time', but i don't know if I'm sure when that time is, and i don't want to selfishly keep him around while he suffers.

And please, before anyone says anything, i am more than aware of the mistakes I've made in regards to calculating costs and managing insurance. I will not be getting another dog for a long while, certainly until my financial situation stabilizes, and have more than learned from my mistakes. Please no lectures on that subject, I'd appreciate it. Right now i just want to figure out what is best for my sweetheart.

I have a sweet, 14 year old corgi-lab (corgidor, if you will) mix who weighs about 55lbs, named Diz. Tl;dr is at the bottom. 

On Thursday morning, I noticed a swollen bump on her face, along the jawline / upper neck area. It was just smaller than a tennis ball, but larger than a golf ball. When I gently touched it she was ok, but when I started to massage it she sharply inhaled - no yelping or whining. 

I gave her some Benadryl and kept an eye on her throughout the day, and this seemed to help the swelling a bit - but idk how much of that was me wanting it to be so. She wasn't eating or drinking much and generally seemed lethargic and very fatigued. So, off to the vet we went on Friday.

The vet noted that Diz had a fever and diagnosed the swelling as an edema (swelling due to fluids). He prescribed antibiotics and Carprofen, and they administered fluids into her back to help with hydration. Aside from looking pretty funny since now she had the edema bump on her face and the fluid bump on her back, she seemed to be in better spirits and moving around with a little more energy.

Saturday, she was moving okay. It was still a struggle to get her up and moving for her walks. She was eating and taking her meds and actually drinking water. So I didn't worry too much.

This morning, she seemed a bit more lethargic again. This time she's been panting occasionally, and when she lays down for pets, she totally thuds down (rather than easing herself down). Facial swelling is still there and now the front leg on the same side is swollen. 

The vet originally instructed to call with an update in 3 days if the swelling hasn't gone down, but didn't say anything about if it increased or spread. Should I give the vet a call or wait the full 3 days? Is there anything else I can do to help my ol girl out?

I would say my boyfriend and I have equally bonded with her, spoiling her lol, but she hates to see either one of us leave, reaches out to either one for comfort etc. We’re definitely interchangeable, but she’s a momma’s girl for sure (yay me! 😋) 

Last night, he went out to our friend’s house around 5/6 and I felt like I wasn’t feeling quite right.

So he leaves, I lay down with some water thinking the sodium in the meatball sub I had for lunch probably dried me out... lol. 

Molly, immediately, went from her normal, psycho energy self to my caretaker like THAT. I’ve never seen this side of her before and it was amazing. I’ve heard dogs can sense when something’s wrong, but, for example, she bashes the bells on our back door to play outside every 5 mins and she stopped - never asked to use the bathroom (I felt bad afterwards, but seems like she held it, I even offered to take her out around 9 &amp; midnight to make sure) and you could not separate her from me if you tried. She normally doesn’t like sleeping on our bed next to us (too hot) but she curled right up with either her head or paw on me always. There was 0 puppy biting (she’s 4 months old), all kisses, and lots of nuzzles. 

My anxiety shot down (severe fear of throwing up - I’ll fight it relentlessly, also didn’t have to worry about her getting into her usual shenanigans since I had 0 energy to lift my head off of my pillow) and I managed to get a solid nights sleep... except to check on her. I just feel like we bonded 5x over last night how we bonded altogether in the last 2 months and I’m a proud momma.

I recently received information that a mutual friend’s friend - honestly this was such a long shot I still can’t believe it happened - actually has a standard poodle that they are looking to re home...

See for me, I always played with the idea of going to the shelter and getting a dog, but due to needing a hypoallergenic dog I found Poodles are exactly what I needed. This kinda plays out perfectly for me and I would be happy to adopt a dog that needs a loving home, and it’s a standard poodle! Seems like such a win/win. Only downside is I miss out on when the dog is really young which I did want to experience, but maybe it’s a good thing I don’t have to go through that. Also the dog is still very young.

The dog is 1 years old. I asked the current owner a bunch of questions like where they got the dog from, what’s the reasoning why they don’t want it anymore, the temperament and behavior of the dog....everything seems to be OK. The owner seems to have 4 kids and 3 dogs total, 1 other standard and husky, and she just can’t give the dog the attention she wants. But also for all I know this is total bullshit and the dog is a complete mess and she needs to offload the dog..

I am going to meet the dog in person, being a first time dog owner (besides the dogs I grew up with), what should I be on the lookout for?! I really have no idea. Can someone with experience help? The last thing I want to do is take this dog with me a realize something is wrong with him. I will obviously be on the lookout of the overall home/space the dogs living in, just the overall demeanor of the owner of the dogs and how they act....

From pictures the dog looks to be in very good shape and perfectly fine.

I also have asked the following questions -

Q: Where did you get the dog?
A: a friend that had puppies. (red flag for me right now, I need more information and will talk to her in person)

Q: how old is the dog?
A: the dog is 1 years old

Q: how is the dog trained? 
A: Doesn’t go to the bathroom in the house at all. Basic training done but nothing extensive.

Q: why are you letting the dog go?
A: I currently have 4 kids and 3 dogs. This dog is the youngest. I am moving out of our current area and I can’t take 3 dogs with me. Honestly the dog is not getting the attention it deserves also and it needs a new home

Q: What is the temperament/behavior of the dog? 
A: the dog is very protective (at least she’s being honest). He loves kids, loves to be touched and loves to play ball. Honestly he’s so sweet and smart (seems like a lot of Poodles I’ve met so far are sweet and smart)

Q: is the dog neutered?
A: no, not yet.  

This is just what I’ve asked so far. I would hopefully ask more questions on the parents of the dog and where they got him. From all I can tell, it seems like the situation is just not ideal for the dog and they want him to have a new home/they’re moving. The last thing I want though is to take the dog and realize he’s somewhat of a mess. 

Does anyone have any advice, what questions I should ask, and what I should be on the lookout for? I would love to help out a dog in need, but I don’t want this to backfire on me.

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm at a lost what to do. It was like she had a different personality. I'm so scared she's going to attack another dog or get attacked herself. 

(Our rescue is very good with people. She didn't mind the vet handling her, and she isn't defensive when people/things come from around her injured left eye. She's easy to calm when she starts barking at strange noises.)



More info:
She was spayed by the shelter about a week and a half ago.

3-4 years old.

Owner surrendered (old owner moved out of State).

Adopted Saturday 6/29.

Still working on separation anxiety, being a newly adopted dog and all.

When my fiance and I were at the shelter, she was very scared when the other dogs started barking. She didn't want to go past the cages that had barking dogs.

Greeted a golden retriever nicely last week but there was a metal fence in between them.

Our dog was raised in an apartment. We currently also live an apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

   So, my wife and I have had this dog for 16 years. He is a blue heeler border collie mix. He has been the best pup for most of his life. Ron has been potty trained, knew the difference in his toys from the frisbee to the ball, could do all kinds of tricks, was super cuddly, etc. As he has aged, obviously he has lost the ability to play, does his own thing most of the time, can't see well, deaf, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

   When my wife is home he will use the bathroom outside like he always has. When my wife is gone and it is just he and I, he will primarily use the bathroom inside no matter what I do. Today, for example, I was working outside so I brought him outside with me thinking that this would ensure that he uses the bathroom out there. We stayed outside for a few hours and as soon as we came in, like literally through the threshold, he pooped. I clean the poo and he goes to lay in the hallway... A few seconds later and I hear what sounds like water running.. he is peeing while laying, not moving, just laying in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just one example, at first I thought maybe it was his age (16) that he wasn't able to hold it but over time I have noticed this ONLY occurs while my wife is gone. My wife leaves on the weekends for work and when I am home I watch the dogs. Events like this are literally every single time it is just him and I... I am losing my mind trying to figure out a way to make him use the bathroom outside when it is just us. It almost seems as if he holds it, waiting for me to bring him back in the house. I can't imagine that dogs have the capacity of being malicious and planning something like this but it is getting to the point that its all I can figure. 

&amp;#x200B;

   This is almost humorous. Last weekend, I had him outside with me for about an hour. He walked around (he has gotten to the point where he will almost exclusively do small circles outside unless you lead him elsewhere) for about 30 minutes while I was raking and cleaning up the yard. Finally, I was heading in and when I picked him up to carry him up the stairs, that is when he decided to poo... in my arms... 

&amp;#x200B;

   Treats for going outside do not seem to be a motivation to him at all.  None of this happens when my wife is home. Even if I am the one who will take him out, he will revert right back to his normal operational self and potty outside exclusively.

I drive a 2019 Honda HRV. I leave the back seats down for them. I'm not comfortable not having then harnessed or secured in some way. 

Based on the sizes of my three dogs, what methods or harnesses are the safest to use? Is it safer if I have them sitting in the backseat, hooked into the seatbelt? The back of an HRV does have several spots to tether pets. 

I'd love links to some of your favorite, most trusted products, or other suggestions.

My old buddy has been dealing with GOLPP the last 2 years. Despite the labored breathing he’s been his cheery self, eating just fine but not being able to do his typical walks in the woods like he used to. Hind legs are wobbly but most of the time he’s happy and wagging his tail.

But this weekend was hot. We don’t have AC at my grandma’s house but had him inside with fans, and had family over for the 4th of July so he was a bit overstimulated. Was probably snuck a lot of human food off the table too. He started puking yesterday and last night was struggling to breathe more than he ever has before. Seemed almost like Cheyne-Stokes type breathing. We thought he was going to pass away in his sleep, so I slept with him on the floor. But he made it through the night. Today he’s thrown up again twice, mostly fluid, and I bought him an AC unit to keep in a room until we go home tonight.

He’s calm now in the room with AC and just snoozing but still breathing a bit harder than usual, but I wanted to see if anybody else has had experience with an old dog with GOLPP and if there’s a hard-fast rule about when it’s time to let him go and just put him down. If this kind of thing happens again it’s obviously time, but if he rebounds once he’s back home in AC I’m not really sure what to do...I just don’t want him to suffer and this week it really felt like he was for the first time.

# Head of Heart

To begin with, I should ask myself what is driving me; **Am I motivated by my head or my heart?** Let’s be honest about that and have a clear analysis to determine if the dream is compatible with what will become my reality for the next 10 to 15 years.

Assuming I’m not living alone, I’ll need to interview the members of my family to know if everyone wants, or at least is open, to being part of the project to welcome a dog into our home. This, of course, is just to keep the harmony intact. Perhaps my kids have been trying to convince me for so long that now I’m beginning to think of getting a dog. If that’s the case, then I should think again, being very aware that no matter how many promises have been made, the truth is that only the adults will be responsible in the end for both the dog and the kids. 

Another detail, and it’s not a small one, is that dogs have and will lose hair no matter what season we’re in, and they also bring dust (and mud) into the house. It’s a wise choice for me to find out if anyone is allergic rather than figuring this out afterwards. If these three points are checked, then let’s go on to the next question.

# Resources

**Do I have the resources?** These resources are money, time and physical energy. Speaking of money, the cost of a dog isn’t cheap and includes: food!, accessories (like beds, a crate, a safe transport box, toys, brushes), equipment (like leashes, harnesses, collars, medals, and maybe a GPS too), grooming for some of them, a dog walker if I’m working long hours, and doggy-care or a pension if I’m unable to bring him or her with me on my vacation. To this, I also need to add medical and healthcare costs, which means visits to the vet, vaccines, special pills to prevent worms, fleas, ticks, infections several times a year, and other bills and medicines in case of unplanned events. Here in Switzerland, I also have to add him or her to my liability insurance and pay a small, annual tax for public things like off-leash dog parks, doggy bags, and awareness about dogs in general.

From a time perspective, as dogs are intelligent and social, they need us for walks, guidance, teaching, care, and interactions with others and their environment to develop nicely. This is, and will be, the menu of a life, even during bad times, rainy days, and cold nights. Am I really ready and fit for all this? If the answer is yes, then bravo, you’ve earned a treat, and we can move on to question #3.

# Age of Dog

**Should I get a puppy, adult or senior dog?** We’re all fans of cute little puppies, including me! But what does it really mean to have a baby dog at home? Well, it’s about starting from scratch, and minimizing our mistakes! Yes, at this young age, human responsibilities will be to provide a lot of care and kind guidance. First, to potty-train (staying nearby, cleaning up, taking the puppy outside, numerous times during the day and the night). Then, to help gain confidence in most common situations in life, I’ll need to have the puppy discover their environment, learn the good doggy-manners, learn how to behave well with other species too, and get to like moments alone, to wait, to give, to come back, etc. – at home and if traveling with me! Don’t worry though, all this can be accomplished using modern, scientifically-proven training or clicker training methods. 

Moving on now to adult dogs. They often already know the basics. Depending on their past, they will be very thankful to get a loving family. And, if needed, I know that anyone (including dogs!) can learn at any age and I also know that I can contact a behaviorist to help me and my dog in case of troubles, which might be things like fear, barking, walking on a leash together, etc.

If I feel like all this might be too complicated for me (my long list of conditions) or if I’m living a slower life already, then adopting a senior dog might very well be a good fit for everyone.

I’m looking into getting an Aussie puppy and I found a breeder online that I might go with.  I’ve already done my research on the breed characteristics so I am sure that the dog will fit into my life well since I want to get involved in dog sports.  However, there are some flags that I wanted to talk about before going through putting a deposit on a puppy from them. 

The contract seems reasonable and covers more than I would expect.  The puppies cost $1200, which seems about average and there’s no difference between color or sex.  They come with a two year health guarantee against hereditary defects such as dysplasia, epilepsy, and eye defects.  They come with AKC papers plus their medical history with the vet.  They will take back the dog any time for any reason and if I decide to sell the dog, first priority goes to the breeder.  There’s a neuter/spay agreement where I’d have to wait until at least 6 months but no longer than 16 months for a female and 24 months for a male.  There are stipulations to include proper care: heartworm treatment, high quality diet, yearly vet visits, proper mental and physical exercise, and to not keep the dog in a yard or kennel.  The dog has to be a member of the family and can’t be used as a guard dog.  There is an incentive program to get $50 each for the first four titles the puppy receives as they can use it to promote their program.  All of this seems good to me.

The parents are their family pets that also help on their farm.  They have young children and the dogs do well playing with them.  They have an off switch at the end of the day even though they do herd.  The pups are raised in the house and have been handled multiple times a day by the breeder and the children.  They’ve been outside to play and are being exposed to random things on their farm to help socialize them.  They’ve been to the vet three times as they are five weeks old now, once for dew claws and docking, twice for worming and check up.  They post on their social media pages multiple times a week and the people who already have deposits interact with them.  The breeder has already screened me by asking for references and what the home life is like.  They’ve even asked for some pictures.  Overall, I like them a lot and feel like one of their pups would be a good fit for me.

The flags that I have are making me hesitant from purchasing.  

First, this is their first time breeding ever.  I asked for references and I received the names of the sire’s breeder, dam’s breeder, their vet, and the breeder/trainer they are working with.  I was able to talk to the vet and the vet said the dogs are in good condition and nothing serious has been noted in their charts.  I also talked to the breeder/trainer.  They’re an AKC breeder of merit of the same breed and show their dogs extensively.  They have trained the dam for herding and the dam’s sister as well.  They have met the sire when they were boarded with them for a few days.  They said that there are no red flags and that they would be comfortable getting a puppy from them if they had room in their program.  There are champions in both of their pedigrees but not recently.  They said the mom’s temperament is good, likes having a job, friendly, biddable, smart, very good with other dogs and children.  The sire they have less of an opinion of since they haven’t been around him as much, but they said that he was good around strangers and didn’t have any aggression.  I would get a pup from the breeder of merit but they’re not expecting a litter for at least a year.  Also since it’s their first litter, there wasn’t a waiting list per se, but it’s only a small flag since everyone has to start somewhere.  

Second, I won’t be able to go to their house not because they won’t let me but because logistically, they are located too far for me to travel to.  They’ve agreed to meet us halfway driving since there’s another buyer getting a pup from the litter in the same region as me.  It’s only a couple hundred extra to the price and that is when I will be meeting them in person.

Third, which is probably the biggest flag to me.  They’ve genetically tested the parents for hereditary diseases but haven’t OFA’d their joints and eyes yet since both are just shy of two years.  I know that it’s best to get puppies from parents with it done already but I was wondering if it would be ok since there hasn’t been any history of dysplasia recently in either of their lines.  The only genetic testing that came back not normal was there was one copy of DM and one copy of MDR1 but no chance for homozygous and a 50% chance for heterozygous for either gene in the offspring.

Fourth, the parents haven’t been titled extensively.  The sire has a farm dog certification and shown in conformation.  The dam hasn’t been shown.  Both herd livestock on the their farm so they’ve been proven that way.

Would you feel comfortable getting a puppy from this breeder?  Should I move on and try to find a different breeder that I like?  I’ve looked at breeders closer and they give me a lot more pause because they have multiple litters a year and have over a dozen breeding dogs.

TL:DR: First time dog breeder that uses the parents to herd livestock on their family farm.  The sire has some showing experience.  Are working with a long time breeder of merit and I have spoken to them.  Parents have been genetically tested but not OFA’d yet since they are both just shy of two years old.  Breeder is willing to meet halfway since they are a long distance away from my location and another person in my region is purchasing from them.  Puppies are raised and socialized in their house around the family which includes children.  Come with a two year hereditary diseases health guarantee, will take dog back at anytime, I must provide proper care, and has an incentive program for titling the puppy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the length, it’s a long one but I want to cover everything.

We have tried to keep him in the living room with us but he gives no warning signs at all before squatting and peeing. If we catch him peeing in our place we will try to take him out, but he often just starts peeing again in the hallway either outside our apartment or in between the elevator downstairs and outside. Even when I place him in the kitchen so that I can shower, he has peed again by the time I come out.  

When he was a puppy, it was very easy to just carry him to the elevator and outside, but now that he is 55lbs it is obviously rather difficult. After an accident, we clean up using Nature's Miracle and throw out the paper towel immediately. We have also taken to steaming our kitchen floor to try to eliminate any residual orders as well. Just now, my husband steamed the floor and we placed him in the kitchen to vacuum...he immediately peed. 

We have had no poop accidents in the house, just pee. We were told by the breeder that there may be some regression, but we weren't expecting it until he was 7 or 8 months old while he is currently 16 weeks.  

It's obviously become very frustrating for us. We're going through a bottle of Nature's Miracle almost every five days, as we clean up accidents in the hallway with it as well (carpet and tile). What can we do when we can't carry him outside? Any tips for potty training in an apartment with a giant breed? Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I recently got a Saint Bernard. We went and picked him up at 9 weeks and have had him at our place since. Following most of the advice and books we have read, we took him out every two hours and kept him on a strict schedule with feeding as well, taking him out 15 minutes after he was done eating. When he wouldn&amp;#39;t eat his meals, we would take the food away after half an hour and take him out as well.

We already had two cats who had previously lived with dog when we got her, and when we got the dog we kept a gate down the middle of the house for introductions. At first it was closed all the time and we would only let the cats over to the dog's side while she was on a leash. Then we moved up to leaving the gate open when were were sitting around at night once she'd calmed down from her evening zooms. Then progressed to leaving the gate open throughout the day, then the night when we were sleeping too, then when we left the house. 

By human standards she doesn't usually bother the cats 'for no reason', she will often try to play with them which they ignore or hiss at. But the dog will also get very protective of her resources when the cats are around. Sometimes the only reason she eats her dinner is because a cat is walking by. Other times if a cat walks near her bowl she'd just rush over to the bowl to guard it. She also has several treat bones for chewing which have caused her to bark at or give the cats a bit of a chase because they've come too close to her treats or food. 

She's also very jealous of anyone else getting attention. If one of the cats wants to come on our lap, she'll cry, bark, or chase the cat away. Even if we're just petting the cat while it's on it's tree she'll still cry or bark at us because we're not giving her the attention. At the dog park if I pet another dog she gets jealous and has to hurry over to insert herself between me and the other dog for pets a lot of the time. 

When she gets jealous for attention I try to pet both her and the other animal at the same time telling her that the other animal is 'nice' and that she's a good girl (only when she's actually just sitting there nicely). I don't really know what to do with the food issue, I tell her that the cat's not going to take her treats but that's almost more for me since it's not like she understands me. She's not food aggressive with humans, I would pet her, sit by her, even put my hand in her bowl or take a treat away from her if I wanted to. It's just the other animals. She's also the only dog we've ever had that's tried to bite the parrot back when the parrot gives her a nip in warning to stay away.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*  Not our first dog. I grew up with a small zoo of animals, including 6 dogs. We also adopted a 6wo puppy from a rescue about a year ago, but recently had to return her when her behavior issues and biting were putting our kids and guests in danger. We believe she never learned bite inhibition because she was born earlier than expected (mom was in foster when puppies were born) and was separated from her siblings too soon. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

*  We are leaning hard towards a reputable breeder, although we are open to the idea of a breed specific rescue if we are able to find out info on the original breeder. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

*  Affectionate and loving, driven to please, somewhat lazy but willing to run around and play fetch and go on walks, trainable, good with kids (ours are 8 and 2, will be closer to 9 and 3 when we are looking to get the dog), not giant or tiny. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*  The big ones we are looking at are cocker spaniels, cockapoos, golden retrievers, and goldendoodle. They all seem to meet those criteria. I personally would prefer the cocker spaniel or the golden retriever, but my husband is a little concerned about shedding. Leaning towards cocker because they are a nice size, but the golden is my dream dog 😬

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*  Basic commands (sit, stay, return). We want a family pet that is good with people, mostly. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

*  No.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

*  I'm a former stay at home mom that teaches preschool part time, so I am home a large portion of the day. Ideally the dog would be happy with one decent walk per day, as well as lots of outside playtime in the yard with me or the kids. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

*  See above. I'd like to be able to take the dog to the dog park sometimes, but it would not be a consistent part of her exercise. Planning on using walks and playing fetch for most exercise. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

*  I'm completely fine with a fair amount of brushing or trimming, and I would definitely be doing most grooming at home. If we went with a cocker spaniel or a doodle, I would be keeping the hair fairly short. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

*  Medium. Sweet spot would be 15-30lbs, but again, we are willing to go bigger for the perfect fit. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*  I dont mind shedding too much, although it does bother my husband more than me. Barking is okay if it is for a reason. The less slobber the better, please. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*  Not important at all. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*  All the snuggles, please.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*  Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*  Barking or initially cautious is fine, and then I would want them to respond to me telling them it's okay. We aren't looking for a guard dog, but my husband does work nights occasionally, so I wouldnt mind a dog that alerts. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*  Not one that is aggressive out of the gate, or one that is known to be an aggressive breed. I would work with a trainer if this is a problem that came up later. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

*  Biting past the teething puppy stage. Not being fully housebroken.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*  I would say a few hours per day max as a general rule, as I work part time, but we occasionally go out for the day to the zoo etc. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*  My husband loves big dogs, but realizes that a giant breed is not practical. He dislikes tiny dogs.He isn't a huge fan of tons of shedding. He is a little worried about a repeat of our last dog with biting. Our oldest would love a golden, and felt completely in love with my mom's mini goldendoodle during a recent visit. He loves to run around with dogs, and likes to play fetch. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*  No, and we do not plan on getting another animal besides the dog.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*  Yes. Both our children, and any children that come over to play with them.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*  We currently own a home, but we will have to rent for one year, two years from now. After that we will be buying a house again. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*  Nashville, TN. None that I know of.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*  Summer is hot and humid, regularly low to mid 90s during the day. Winter is usually high 30s to low 40s, with colder and warmer periods. Winter is fairly wet. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

*  No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; See above. I&amp;#39;d like to be able to take the dog to the dog park sometimes, but it would not be a consistent part of her exercise. Planning on using walks and playing fetch for most exercise. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&amp;#39;m completely fine with a fair amount of brushing or trimming, and I would definitely be doing most grooming at home. If we went with a cocker spaniel or a doodle, I would be keeping the hair fairly short. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Medium. Sweet spot would be 15-30lbs, but again, we are willing to go bigger for the perfect fit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I dont mind shedding too much, although it does bother my husband more than me. Barking is okay if it is for a reason. The less slobber the better, please. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Not important at all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; All the snuggles, please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Eager to please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Barking or initially cautious is fine, and then I would want them to respond to me telling them it&amp;#39;s okay. We aren&amp;#39;t looking for a guard dog, but my husband does work nights occasionally, so I wouldnt mind a dog that alerts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Not one that is aggressive out of the gate, or one that is known to be an aggressive breed. I would work with a trainer if this is a problem that came up later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Biting past the teething puppy stage. Not being fully housebroken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I would say a few hours per day max as a general rule, as I work part time, but we occasionally go out for the day to the zoo etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; My husband loves big dogs, but realizes that a giant breed is not practical. He dislikes tiny dogs.He isn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of tons of shedding. He is a little worried about a repeat of our last dog with biting. Our oldest would love a golden, and felt completely in love with my mom&amp;#39;s mini goldendoodle during a recent visit. He loves to run around with dogs, and likes to play fetch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; No, and we do not plan on getting another animal besides the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Yes. Both our children, and any children that come over to play with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We currently own a home, but we will have to rent for one year, two years from now. After that we will be buying a house again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Nashville, TN. None that I know of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Summer is hot and humid, regularly low to mid 90s during the day. Winter is usually high 30s to low 40s, with colder and warmer periods. Winter is fairly wet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; No additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26) Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;/p&gt;

her collar is the same material but it's padded on the inside. i don't really have trouble with getting a collar as a simple padded one will do as she needs to wear it 24/7 for identification.

do any of you guys have any recommendations for collars/leads? i know they have the brand trixie there so if any of you guys have any trixie leads which you use and find half decent lemme know. or anything else you find good?? also if you guys have any material recommendations that don't rub fur off as much or burn hands?

I write this to you at 2a.m after having been woken up to a poop smell in our bedroom. This is the second time she’s done this today.. There is a bit of background you should know about before you answer...

1. Luna was born with hip dysplasia and possibly some nerve damage in her back end. 

2. Luna is on a hypoallergenic diet and rarely gets food that is not for hypoallergenic dogs.

3. For the last year Luna gets cosequinn and a pro biotic with her breakfast and is fed 2x a day. Once at 630am and once at 630pm. (We have a diabetic Boston who gets fed and is given insulin at these times. So everyone gets fed at the same times). 

4. We got a new dog, Bonez, our 4 year old diabetic Boston in March and they get a long really really well. 

5. Luna still poops and pees in her kennel. Even when we made her kennel only big enough for her to turn around in. She has been doing this since we got her. 

5. Luna likes to eat her own poop. We have tried MANY poop eating deterrents however nothings has worked. 

6. Luna almost never pees in the house unless it is in her crate. But pooping accidents in the house can be a common experience. She also poops probably 5 times a day.

My partner's friend/housemate has a 6 year old beagle. The dog lives outside and has shelter and water and is fed twice a day (at whatever hour he wakes up!). But that's the extent of interaction. He doesn't ever play with her and takes her for zero walks. She just sits at the back door all day waiting to come in, which never happens as he wont let her inside. So she gets 2 mins interaction a day during feeding. The dog is of course very lonely and has behavioural issues. 

I have tried explaining to him that it's cruel but he won't listen. I have asked him to give her up but he says he's had her since she was a puppy so he could never give her away. I've sent advice of how to look after dogs and why they need walks, to no avail. I've suggested dog walkers. my partner has done the same and we have taken her for walks and played with her ourselves. 

The reason she can't come inside is that she's too crazy (his own doing) and that's also why he won't play with her, cause she's too annoying. 

The dog is messed up and sad. It has a red eye also but he says that's common in beagles. Her legs sometimes shake a bit too. Yes, there are many dogs worse off, but it has a pretty miserable life and I'm gutted that soon it will have no walks and no playtime again, as my boyfriend is moving out. 

I am struggling knowing that the dog will live the rest of its life like that. It's now at the point that this guy won't listen to anything more on the issue.

The pup will be staying in my mom and I's house. My mom works a typical 9-5 and I work 3rd shift on the weekends with school scattered around during the week. We have no other animals, so the pup will be at home alone when I'm in class and on a clinical rotation, but I'm hoping he'll still be able to get plenty of exercise due to the fact that I'm a very active person.

Now I have one. :( 

I adopted Maynard, a Labrador, at 8 weeks old, almost 10 years ago. He was given a Volhard test and was straight down the middle, just the most easy-going mellow guy you'd ever meet. ([He left us suddenly on Wednesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/c8zpte/rip_maynard_labrador_almost_10/).)

I adopted Astrid, a [who knows what](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/c5sae2/breeds_my_street_stray_rescue/), as an adult, in 2011 (so she's probably about 9, but looks and acts about 3). She was basically a feral street-stray rescue. Our life together has been interesting. She's dog reactive, but once she gets to know another four-legger, they'll be BFFs for life. It usually only takes a walk around the block or so for that to happen.

She's kind of ... inappropriately assertive, though. When I fed them, I'd feed Maynard first and time it right for Astrid's food, so that by the time she finished he was finished, otherwise she'd nudge him out of the way and finish his bowl for him (and he'd let her). Likewise, if they had high value treats (bully sticks, etc), she'd inevitably try to take his away - right out of his mouth if necessary. I would position myself between them to stop that from happening. (I didn't have to physically intervene, just a stern ""no!"" and a point in the direction she needed to go, was enough.)

I got Astrid to keep Maynard company when I was at the office. Now that he's gone, I need to find *her* a companion. I don't know if they were technically a bonded pair, but they were inseparable when they were together (I had to board them at a cage-free doggie daycare place for a few days once, and the Facebook photos the facility uploaded showed them never more than an arm's length apart, and they always slept curled up with one another). I've checked in on her at home on my doggiecam when I had Maynard with me for a chemotherapy appointment or at the office afterwards, and she was frenetic all day. :( (Watching them together at home alone, they just curled up with one another or occasionally would play tug-of-war with a rope toy.)

Anyway. I want to get a puppy for her. (And me.) I don't want to risk bringing an adult dog into the home who might have a trauma history, resource guarding issues, etc. But I've never done anything like this before. Maynard was so mellow, he didn't mind having Astrid come into our home, but I'm not sure how to acclimate Astrid to a new brother.

I think she'll ultimately do fine; this was her with a little guy we fostered for a month or so, a couple of years ago: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz47Y9HQrGc

Are there techniques I can study up on? Safety precautions I need to plan for? I'm sure I can ham-fist my way through this, but I'd love to have some actual idea of what I'm doing before I try...

We're looking at adopting in a couple of months, unless I should do it sooner (or later). I can work from home a lot, take either or both dogs to the office when I don't, etc., so I can pretty flexibly do this. I crate-trained Maynard, but we don't have the crate anymore. (But of course I could buy another one.) Astrid was never crate trained, because she was attacked in a kennel at the county pound before I got her, and panics in enclosed spaces.

(I didn&amp;#39;t have to physically intervene, just a stern &amp;quot;no!&amp;quot; and a point in the direction she needed to go, was enough.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got Astrid to keep Maynard company when I was at the office. Now that he&amp;#39;s gone, I need to find &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; a companion. I don&amp;#39;t know if they were technically a bonded pair, but they were inseparable when they were together (I had to board them at a cage-free doggie daycare place for a few days once, and the Facebook photos the facility uploaded showed them never more than an arm&amp;#39;s length apart, and they always slept curled up with one another). I&amp;#39;ve checked in on her at home on my doggiecam when I had Maynard with me for a chemotherapy appointment or at the office afterwards, and she was frenetic all day. :( (Watching them together at home alone, they just curled up with one another or occasionally would play tug-of-war with a rope toy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I want to get a puppy for her. (And me.) I don&amp;#39;t want to risk bringing an adult dog into the home who might have a trauma history, resource guarding issues, etc. But I&amp;#39;ve never done anything like this before. Maynard was so mellow, he didn&amp;#39;t mind having Astrid come into our home, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to acclimate Astrid to a new brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think she&amp;#39;ll ultimately do fine; this was her with a little guy we fostered for a month or so, a couple of years ago: &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz47Y9HQrGc""&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz47Y9HQrGc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there techniques I can study up on? Safety precautions I need to plan for? I&amp;#39;m sure I can ham-fist my way through this, but I&amp;#39;d love to have some actual idea of what I&amp;#39;m doing before I try...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re looking at adopting in a couple of months, unless I should do it sooner (or later). I can work from home a lot, take either or both dogs to the office when I don&amp;#39;t, etc., so I can pretty flexibly do this. I crate-trained Maynard, but we don&amp;#39;t have the crate anymore. (But of course I could buy another one.) Astrid was never crate trained, because she was attacked in a kennel at the county pound before I got her, and panics in enclosed spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;

He watches me with focus as I do errands around the house. I’ve heard him whine while I’m in the bathroom.

Is this normal for a newly adopted pet, given that he may miss his previous family and fears another abandonment? Will he get over it? Do I ignore most of it and ride it out, or do I begin to train better traits now? Sometimes I catch him whining even as he is laid up at my feet, which makes me think that he just misses his first family. Granted, it is only day 2. I am slowly introducing crate training, and although he is finding comfort in his crate, he whines even when I close the crate door and can be seen moving about in the same room as he. When he is free, he is attached at my hip and will follow me wherever I go, tripping me, etc. I can’t go to the kitchen for a glass of water without him following me there and back to my room. 

Having noticed this on day one, research has told me to stop rewarding him with affection and attention whenever he vies for it, so I don’t pet him anymore when he sticks his head in my lap. I am starting to instill the “Stay” command. He didn’t come with any commands learned beyond an occasional “Sit”.  He used to live life on home grounds only — the family never walked him and would only let him out into the backyard (he’s also beginning to learn socialization and leash skills with me.) As he socializes, will he get better with separation?

I don’t mind his loyalty, but I just want him to be able to find comfort in my absence. He is also my first dog, so I’m not entirely sure about the procedures and what is normal. All I know is that positive reinforcement is the training style I want to conduct, and have been doing research along those lines. The thing is, I have work the next few days in the evening and I don’t believe that he is ready for the crate yet while I am away since he whines from inside when I am not in sight, and I don’t want to bother my roommates and neighbors. It’s still too early for that. At the same time, I don’t want to let him free and have myself discover his destructive habits when I come back. I also have yet to discover a “high value” reward for him, since he hasn’t taken any interest in any of the toys I bought for him before he arrived. 

Since he is young, I am hopeful. But he is also a year old, and I’m afraid that the previous family may have spoiled him with affection and attention during this time, given that there were two small children and a stay at home mom in his previous home. I am prepared and available to bring him around with me to most places I go, but there will always be an occasion that he cannot attend, and I’d like to curtail any long-term anxieties and discomforts now before I do something to prolong and enable them.

Does anyone else have any similar experiences with a clingy pet with signs of separation anxiety? What routines, training techniques, articles, etc. have worked for you? What can be my immediate yet temporary solution for the days I will have to leave for work, with the lowest risk of destructive habits? How long can a Kong toy keep him occupied, given that he even takes any interest to it? He is a very sweet boy and can even be shy in the presence of new humans. I just want him to find comfort in being along, and be a chill dog, as I know he has it in him. Many thanks for any and all suggestions in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently adopted a big ol’ baby pitbull (1 year, ~60 lbs, intact) that has become what some would call a “Velcro pet” based on his tendencies to jump up from rest whenever I stand up, and follow me into each room. He watches me with focus as I do errands around the house. I’ve heard him whine while I’m in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal for a newly adopted pet, given that he may miss his previous family and fears another abandonment? Will he get over it? Do I ignore most of it and ride it out, or do I begin to train better traits now? Sometimes I catch him whining even as he is laid up at my feet, which makes me think that he just misses his first family. Granted, it is only day 2. I am slowly introducing crate training, and although he is finding comfort in his crate, he whines even when I close the crate door and can be seen moving about in the same room as he. When he is free, he is attached at my hip and will follow me wherever I go, tripping me, etc. I can’t go to the kitchen for a glass of water without him following me there and back to my room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having noticed this on day one, research has told me to stop rewarding him with affection and attention whenever he vies for it, so I don’t pet him anymore when he sticks his head in my lap. I am starting to instill the “Stay” command. He didn’t come with any commands learned beyond an occasional “Sit”.  He used to live life on home grounds only — the family never walked him and would only let him out into the backyard (he’s also beginning to learn socialization and leash skills with me.) As he socializes, will he get better with separation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind his loyalty, but I just want him to be able to find comfort in my absence. He is also my first dog, so I’m not entirely sure about the procedures and what is normal.

Apologies for all the backslashes after the numbers; format wouldn't correctly copy and paste for me so I did my best to fix it and this was the only way to have the numbers not all show as 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1\\)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

* I had a dog for a bit growing up but this will be my first time as the primary owner of a dog.  

2\\)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

* No preference  

3\\)  Describe your ideal dog.  

* Calm, lovable, shaggy companion that gets me out of the house and enjoys my company.  

4\\)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

* I've tried a few quizzes to find a breed that will suit me and the two that I like the most are Bergamasco Sheepdog and Basenji. The more I research them both, the more I find conflicting information about what kind of lifestyles they are best suited for. I love the shaggy, moppy look of the Bergamasco and from what I've read, they are a calm but vigilant, intelligent, low-maintenance breed. I've read conflicting things about their exercise needs and I'm worried that a condo life with me at work all day may not be best suited. The Basenji seems full of character and it was recommended as a great apartment breed, but I've also read they have a tendency to be particularly destructive.  

5\\)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

* I don't need a dog that's going to do tricks on command but a dog that I could train to follow basic obedience would be preferable.  

6\\)  Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

* No  

**Care Commitments**

7\\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

* I'd like to take a couple of weeks of leave in the beginning to focus on training, socializing, and adapting the dog to its new home, especially if it's younger, but I'd like the time requirements to taper as time goes on. Maybe 1-2 hours/day?  

8\\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

* I would take the dog out in the morning before work and then out for a longer walk after work. I could come home at lunch for a bit but not something I'd be able to do every day. My complex has a dog park and is also near a lake with a beach (not sure if the beach is pet-friendly, though). There are also a few doggy daycare options and dog-walking services available in the area.  

9\\) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

* I don't think I'd trust myself to do some of the grooming properly so I'd probably take the dog to a professional in the beginning until I was comfortable doing some of the things myself. Grooming isn't a huge issue for me but I'd prefer grooming requirements to be a less-than-daily ordeal.  

**Personal Preferences**

10\\) What size dog are you looking for?  

* Mid-size to large, I suppose. Really anything above a toy-sized dog. I have a decent-sized condo but it's still not huge so the larger the dog, the more calm-tempered I would prefer it to be while inside.  

11\\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

* Shedding shouldn't be too much of a problem as long as the dog is hypoallergenic. I live in a complex so I would at least need a breed that isn't going to bark (or yodel for the Basenji) at every noise it hears. Not big on slobber at all.  

12\\) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

* Not sure I understand this question... Is it asking how feasible this is? There is a dog park in my complex that I would like to take the dog to 2-3 times/week or more.  

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13\\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

* A little bit of both, I suppose? I want a companion but also one that isn't overly needy and can be on its own while I'm at work.  

14\\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

* Again, a little bit of both, I think. Same reasons as above.  

15\\) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

* I understand that dogs are likely going to bark at a knock or the doorbell. There are people in the unit above me so I'd like a breed that I could at least convince to quiet down if it heard a noise upstairs. My big thing for visitors is I'd like a dog that I can train not to jump on new people - a personal pet peeve of mine.  

16\\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

* I'd prefer a dog that is not aggressive to other dogs.  

17\\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

* Can't think of any others not mentioned above.

**Lifestyle**

18\\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

* Mon-Fri, during normal working hours. I'd like to try to mitigate this as much as possible, either by stopping home at lunch when I can, a nearby doggy daycare a few times/week, or a dog walking service.  

19\\) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

* Living alone.  

20\\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

* No other pets.  

21\\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

* Unlikely, other than maybe encountering children in my complex while on walks.  

22\\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

* Rent. Rottweiler, Pitbull, or any mix of those not allowed. No weight restrictions listed in the lease.  

23\\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

* Lunenburg, MA. No laws banning any breeds.  

24\\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

* Summers usually in the 70s-80s. Winters get pretty cold; I'd say averaging around 20s-30s but can definitely dip further. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25\\) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

* I'm really trying to approach the idea of having a dog with a full appreciation for the added responsibility and commitment, but I'm starting to think I may be overthinking it a bit. I just don't want to half-ass owning a dog. Given my answers above, please feel free to say if you think getting a dog may just not be right for me right now.  

26\\) Feel free to ask any questions below.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found the following questionnaire in the subreddit info.

She is one of the sweetest animals I could ever ask for. When I first adopted her, I was extremely depressed about it to the point where I wanted to return her to the shelter the very same day. I decided to stick it through and hope that the feelings would pass. The majority of them did, in part thanks to this subreddit, but I am still having trouble. Until this past Saturday, she has been staying with some friends of mine because I didn't have housing approval yet. (She is an ESA.) But now she has been living with me for almost a week. I feel like I can only really relax if she has gone potty though. When she doesn't have business to do, she is a chill and affectionate little dog. I try to feed her three times a day (small portions), give her affection, and take her to the park when I have time and she needs exercise. I have never had a dog before, the most experience I have had has been with my grandparents' dog, and even then it wasn't a lot. He was pretty low maintenance and could be let out to roam on his own to go potty. Where I live, to be outside she has to be on a leash or under voice command at all times, but since she never listens to me, I just keep her on a leash. Yesterday she refused to pee or poop literally all day. She had gone at around 11pm the night before and didn't go again until 9pm the next day. It was stressful and prevented me from getting any work done because I was paranoid that she was going to poop or pee on the carpet. She is mostly house trained, but doesn't know how to let me know that she needs to go outside. In addition to that, for some reason she never wants to poop or pee in the designated outside area. She isn't allowed to do it on the grass, so I have to keep a close eye on her and keep her in the weird, grassless area. But she only tries to pee on the grass and then I move her to finish in the designated area, and she won't poop there. She just pooped on the kitchen floor for the second time this week and I am becoming so frustrated. I worry that by yelling at her, I am encouraging stuff like what happened yesterday to happen again. I don't know how to punish a dog. I don't want to hurt her. To get her to pee when and where she needs to, I have tried as many of the tricks as I could that I have read about online, but none of them have worked. Yesterday I took her out for 10 minutes every half-hour. I knew she would go to the bathroom at the park if I took her, but I don't want her to think that if she refuses to pee, she will get to go to the park. It wasn't until I almost gave up and took her to the park that she finally peed. (I did take her to the park afterward as a reward, but there were fireworks going on and she got scared so we went home.) Today, I saw her pacing around like she normally does before she poops, so I took her outside, but she keeps getting distracted! By people, birds, squirrels, etc. There are either too many stimuli for her to do her business outside or she just really hates the designated potty area. I cried three times yesterday when she wouldn't pee. I almost cried when she pooped on the floor right in front of me. I watched a video on house-training adult dogs and the lady in it said that if you distract your dog from pooping (by clapping or making noise), they should stop for long enough to get them outside. Well, that DOES NOT WORK with her. I feel like I am going to go crazy. I am also worried because I don't really feel bonded/connected to her like other people describe being with their dogs. I know it hasn't been very long, but she latched onto me QUICK. I have been her person from the beginning, but I am still struggling to really love her. I love her on a superficial level, like how one ""loves"" most dogs, but I know that if I loved her on a deeper level, I would be able to be more patient with her. I don't know what to do from here. I try to make sure she gets treats, play time, I try to put her to bed at a decent time every night, but I'm not left with a lot of time for working. (I'm a TA and I control my own hours.) I feel like I'm a terrible dog mom and I know that don't know how to train her properly. Any advice??

I feel like I can only really relax if she has gone potty though. When she doesn&amp;#39;t have business to do, she is a chill and affectionate little dog. I try to feed her three times a day (small portions), give her affection, and take her to the park when I have time and she needs exercise. I have never had a dog before, the most experience I have had has been with my grandparents&amp;#39; dog, and even then it wasn&amp;#39;t a lot. He was pretty low maintenance and could be let out to roam on his own to go potty. Where I live, to be outside she has to be on a leash or under voice command at all times, but since she never listens to me, I just keep her on a leash. Yesterday she refused to pee or poop literally all day. She had gone at around 11pm the night before and didn&amp;#39;t go again until 9pm the next day. It was stressful and prevented me from getting any work done because I was paranoid that she was going to poop or pee on the carpet. She is mostly house trained, but doesn&amp;#39;t know how to let me know that she needs to go outside. In addition to that, for some reason she never wants to poop or pee in the designated outside area. She isn&amp;#39;t allowed to do it on the grass, so I have to keep a close eye on her and keep her in the weird, grassless area. But she only tries to pee on the grass and then I move her to finish in the designated area, and she won&amp;#39;t poop there. She just pooped on the kitchen floor for the second time this week and I am becoming so frustrated. I worry that by yelling at her, I am encouraging stuff like what happened yesterday to happen again. I don&amp;#39;t know how to punish a dog. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her. To get her to pee when and where she needs to, I have tried as many of the tricks as I could that I have read about online, but none of them have worked. Yesterday I took her out for 10 minutes every half-hour. I knew she would go to the bathroom at the park if I took her, but I don&amp;#39;t want her to think that if she refuses to pee, she will get to go to the park. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I almost gave up and took her to the park that she finally peed. (I did take her to the park afterward as a reward, but there were fireworks going on and she got scared so we went home.) Today, I saw her pacing around like she normally does before she poops, so I took her outside, but she keeps getting distracted! By people, birds, squirrels, etc. There are either too many stimuli for her to do her business outside or she just really hates the designated potty area. I cried three times yesterday when she wouldn&amp;#39;t pee. I almost cried when she pooped on the floor right in front of me. I watched a video on house-training adult dogs and the lady in it said that if you distract your dog from pooping (by clapping or making noise), they should stop for long enough to get them outside. Well, that DOES NOT WORK with her. I feel like I am going to go crazy. I am also worried because I don&amp;#39;t really feel bonded/connected to her like other people describe being with their dogs. I know it hasn&amp;#39;t been very long, but she latched onto me QUICK. I have been her person from the beginning, but I am still struggling to really love her. I love her on a superficial level, like how one &amp;quot;loves&amp;quot; most dogs, but I know that if I loved her on a deeper level, I would be able to be more patient with her. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do from here. I try to make sure she gets treats, play time, I try to put her to bed at a decent time every night, but I&amp;#39;m not left with a lot of time for working. (I&amp;#39;m a TA and I control my own hours.) I feel like I&amp;#39;m a terrible dog mom and I know that don&amp;#39;t know how to train her properly. Any advice?? (She is two years old, btw.)&lt;/p&gt;

**Care Commitments**

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* ANSWER: Lean towards snuggly.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* ANSWER: This is the trickiest question for me. Would prefer eager-to-please, however long term midday activities will be a challenge I need to plan for given I can't be home for lunch everyday. Any strategies or suggestions on how to entertain an eager to please dog midday would be much appreciated.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I live with two students who more than likely could assist during lunch. This arrangement would only last for a year however. I need to plan for a more consistent way to entertain my dog midday. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* ANSWER: I live with two students, they are both happy to welcome a dog and could help with some midday walks.

* ANSWER: No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* ANSWER: Manhattan, nope there are a million here especially in my neighborhood.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Immediately started obediance courses and he's been through puppy and adult classes and just passed his CGC. He's 9 months old. 65 lbs. Poodle/pit mix. Loves me. Loves my husband. Loves his vet (and everyone there). Loves his trainer. Loves my mother. Loves the dog park. Very obedient. Listens well. Crate trained. No separation anxiety.

Does beautifully on walks. Never barks or growls at people in public. 

Issue: I'm at my parent's house and my two teenage nephews are here and he growls and barks at them and then runs away from them. 

A few months ago my father in law and brother in law (who is 10) came over and my brother in law put on dog ears, got on all fours and chased my puppy around barking at him. The puppy acted similarly. I am upset with myself over it because even though it made me very uncomfortable, I didn't say anything to stop it because I'm very self conscious around my in laws. It's stupid. I know. 

He will not allow my nephews or my stepfather (who is a large loud man) near him. In public he will hide behind me if someone wants to pet him. But other than that he'll ignore people. His trainer told me to have him sit and then put my feet behind his butt so he can't just pull away, but I feel like I'm forcing him to tolerate strangers. 

I've asked my nephews to just ignore him and that he'll come to them when he feels safe and he has done that, though will still skitter away if they get up or move around.

He's never shown any violent aggression (biting, bearing teeth, etc), just barking, and what I call the talking growl where he doesn't even lift his head and it sounds for all the world like he's just grumbling.

We go out all the time. Dog park. Stores. Walking downtown which can be very busy. He passes people out on walks without any issue and hardly paying any attention to them. 

I'm okay if it's just his personality. I accept him as he is and I wont force him to be a social butterfly if he's not, I just want to do anything I can to make my boy comfortable and confident. 
Any input or shared experiences would be awesome!

Ender is eating, using the bathroom okay, wagging, etc. He's pretty normal outside of the nasal discharge and difficulty breathing. He can still breath, it's just more difficult due to the obstruction. He's also having difficulty sleeping (because of the breathing I think).

Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered

Breed: Great pyrenees

Body weight: ~120lbs

History: Some anxiety, otherwise very healthy

Duration: 2 months



A couple months ago I watched two dogs in my house and it induced anxiety in my pyreenees, Hudson. He's had anxiety before, where he would try to escape whenever I left the house, no matter how much exercise he got or how short of a time I was gone. This time was similar, plus he would be destructive while I was away. This has gotten a lot better as long as I am careful when I leave that the door to the sunroom is left open, blinds open, and some sort of tv or music on.

Along with the anxiety came some depression, I think. He's still very happy to spend time outside at the dog park, or go swimming in the lake, or go for a walk. He's lower energy because it's hot, but he's happy and normal during all of this. At home, he's not. He lays down and doesn't get up for anything except food. He'll eat if I'm up walking around in the kitchen, and he hasn't lost any weight. He refuses to go outside most of the time unless my other dog is barking at something and he wants to see what it is. He usually loves laying outside for hours and hours but now he won't go out without being dragged out, and he won't leave the patio unless I walk out with him, and even then he won''t leave my side when we're outside.

Not really sure what to make of it. Not sure if it is the warm weather (he's more of a winter dog), or the anxiety that he had that was induced by the dogs I watched, or the Bravecto that I gave him. All of this happened around the same time. Any insights?

My family had dogs growing up, but this is my first dog to raise myself (along with my fiancee, who's never had dogs before).

I took him to twice weekly puppy play-sessions with other puppies from the age of 9 weeks straight to 6 months old.  He always played well with small dogs and big dogs alike, and by the end the instructor for the sessions used him frequently as an introduction to playing for new puppies.  We also took him to visit many friends and to some house parties, trying to get him used to meeting people.  When possible, I'd give treats to people we encountered on walks for them to give him after sitting.  Since aging out of the puppy play class at 6 months, we've taken him to a dog park about weekly.  He hasn't had any problems there, and plays well.

For the last couple months or so, though, he has displayed some behavior that is mildly concerning to me, and I was hoping to seek some advice or guidance here.

1. When on walks (on leash) if we encounter another dog, he will frequently bark at it unprovoked.  I don't think it's necessarily aggression, but I also don't think it looks great to the other dog's owner, and would like it to stop.  For a month or so before he started this, he would just whine when passing another dog, because I think he wants it to be playtime.

2. When meeting new people at home, he's very skittish around them for 10-30 minutes before warming up to them.  This is even giving them a few treats to coax him with and having him perform sits/downs for them.  He does these fine.

Is this behavior normal adolescent behavior he will grow out of, do I need to be aggressively trying to train this out of him, or some combination of both?

So for a while now, I've been thinking of getting a dog, which would be my very first one. I just adore the idea of having a fluffy companion by my side!

The first question is about which breeds are suitable for a beginner. I originally wanted to go for a cloud dog (samoyed) or a Shiba inu, but I've read that they are apparently quite the challenging dogs. Now I'm leaning towards going for a labrador. Can you give me your opinions on that? Or suggest another breed for a first timer? I would prefer an at least medium sized dog.

Which also brings me to my second question: Do I have to worry about the size of my flat in comparison to the dog? I live in a 32m2 flat in Berlin with a small balcony. Can bigger dogs still do well in smaller flats? I am a pretty active person and I live really close to a large park.

Finally, how much money do you need to calculate for a dog for each month, on average? I'm sure that differs from dog to dog and breed to breed, but perhaps you can give me a rough estimate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I was at my friends house last night and I decided to bring my dog over to play with his dog . He has an male Australian Shepherd(Dilly) that’s on the smaller side , I have a male chow chow/retriever mix(nikki) medium 65 pounds so he is the bigger dog . Both are the same age at 1 year and 4 months (both born in February of last year) , Dilly has lived with another dog his whole life and Nikki was adopted at 5 months but his previous owner had two other dogs who were much older . Usually when Nikki and Dilly meet up they bark , growl for a bit , sniff eachother then they are fine . So they did the usual meet and greet stuff and my nikki tends to really not pay him too much mind , he’ll lay down and dilly will sniff at him and Nikki usually just lays there and doesn’t really ever mind what dilly does . They actually don’t wrestle or play fight or chase at all , but that’s mostly because Nikki just doesn’t want to play with him , he would prefer to go off and explore the backyard and do his own thing , Dilly usually just follows him around lol . But anyways after about an hour or so of us all hanging outside I decided to give the dogs some treats , both dogs really enjoy catching food so I threw one at my nikki , he ate it . Then I threw one at dilly , dilly wasn’t too sure what it was since he never had this particular treat before so he let it bounce off the floor , as soon as dilly went to go sniff it my dog lunged at dilly and snarled at him , and I think he actually nipped dilly as dilly ran away crying . Didn’t puncture skin but it was pretty sudden . After that situation Nikki refused to let dilly close to him , snarling and lunging at him if he got close . We removed them away from eachother waited 30 mins and tried to reintroduce then but my dog was absolutely not having it . So I decided I would just take the dog home and let my mom watch after him . I honestly have no clue what could have set off Nikki that way , so I was wondering if anyone has insight . Sorry for the long post .

My beautiful old pup has cancer again. The first time was in his lip, which the vet was able to cut out, but now it's back by his jaw and neck and it's inoperable.

Is there anything you'd recommend doing before this time comes? Even if he isn't put to sleep soon, it's inevitable that he will leave me one day, and I want to be prepared and make sure that I have as many lovely keepsakes before that time comes so he feels like he is with me always.

My wife and I have a rescue aussie shepherd mix and do not have any history before he was rescued. We got him when he was about 2 and have had him for about 3 years now. 

He has a severe fear of thunder/lightening and fireworks. Really any loud bang. He jumps on whatever were sitting on and attempts to climb behind us to just jump off. If it's on the bed, he'll jump on us, climb behind our pillows, attempt to burrow in the bed, climb over us, and just not settle down which causes us to not get any sleep. 

Things we have tried...
Thunder vest
Calming treats (variety)
Fluoxitne (had to stop due to it starting to cause seizures)

My parents had a dog when I was in school that had puppies. We’ve had these pups their whole lives, they’re going on 8 or 9 years now. We got rid of a few but were left with four great dogs. 

In March this year, the only boy started acting very lethargic, which was the absolute opposite of his personality. After a few days of him seeming almost depressed, my parents took him to the vet. Long story short, after several trips too and from the vet, they concluded that he’d gotten into some kind of poison. The night they cleared his tummy out he died at the vet. 

This was really hard for us, but as the troublemaker who always ate everything, we couldn’t say we were terribly surprised. 

That was until one of his sisters started acting the same way about two weeks ago. Same deal. In and out of the vet, then they finally decided: she’s got diabetes. She’s sent home with insulin and died the very next day. 

We have SCOURED the house and the backyard for anything they could have gotten in. I’ve checked multiple lists of poisonous plants and foods they could have gotten into, but the fact is they’ve been in the same environment eating the same food for 8 years. The idea that they both got into some kind of poison without us realizing so close together seems impossible.

Is it possible they were diagnosed with diabetes too late and that could have caused their deaths? They were stocky for sure but not alarmingly large.

He also ate some grass and some paper that was on the side of the road before I got to him then vomited.
Can anyone tell me what this is?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s 4:35 am and the first thing in the morning I’ll visit the vet but I’m so nervous I can’t sleep.

We're serious about adopting a puppy, we're financially secure, and we are committed to doing the best we can by our new family member. We have two active boys, ages 5 and 4 and our number #1 goal is integrating the puppy safely into our family.

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* This is our first dog. We have no previous experience owning or training dogs.  

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We will be going through a reputable breeder, once we find one.

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

 

\* A short haired dog of medium to large size who is good with small children. The easier to train and less likely to tear things in the house apart, the better.

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We're fairly open. We don't want anything with significant health issues and it would be nice to have a breed with a longer lifespan. This will be our boys first dog (ours too). It is most important to us that the dog be good with small children.  

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Typical family dog stuff. We're not looking for anything fancy.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* No.  

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We will commit to spending at least an hour interacting with the dog each week day. Two or more hours a day on the weekend. Obviously, when the dog is a puppy we will devote more time.  

&amp;#x200B;

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

&amp;#x200B;

\* We will walk the dog twice a day before and after work. If necessary, we will hire someone to walk the dog during the day too. We can take the dog to a dog park but probably mostly on weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We will do whatever grooming at home that we are able to do and we are willing to pay for regular grooming as necessary.  

&amp;#x200B;

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Medium to large, but not extra large? We're thinking something in the size range of a typical lab or golden.  

&amp;#x200B;

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Honestly, our tolerance for these things is pretty low. We want a well behaved short haired dog.

&amp;#x200B;

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We want to be able to do this as much as possible but it will be tough during weekdays.  

&amp;#x200B;

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Definitely snuggly.

&amp;#x200B;

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Eager-to-please.

&amp;#x200B;

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

&amp;#x200B;

\* We expect the dog will bark when someone approaches the house, rings the bell, etc. We have no problem with that. We're not looking for a guard dog so we expect the dog will be able to be friendly or at least not aggressive with visitors.  

&amp;#x200B;

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We will do what we have to do but we would prefer not to have an aggressive dog.

&amp;#x200B;

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* The dog must be safe with small children. We'd rather not have a dog that ate everything in sight.  

&amp;#x200B;

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* My wife and I are professionals and we work downtown much of the week. At least three days a week the dog will be home alone between 9-5. We are willing to get a dog walker for those three days and we understand that we will not be able to leave the dog for eight hours when it is a small puppy.

&amp;#x200B;

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

&amp;#x200B;

\* The boys just want a snuggly dog they can play with. Me too. My wife is basically on the same page as me but she's nervous about how we will handle a puppy. We all plan to take care of the dog.

&amp;#x200B;

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* No  

&amp;#x200B;

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Yes. Two small boys ages 5 and 4.

&amp;#x200B;

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* No  

&amp;#x200B;

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* We live in the DC suburbs on the Maryland side. We're not aware of any laws banning breeds but we doubt we'd want any breed that has been banned. 

&amp;#x200B;

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Typical disgusting DC area weather. 30-40ish and raining much of the winter. Hot and humid in the summer. Truly the worst climate of any place that has all four seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

&amp;#x200B;

\* No additional information.  

&amp;#x200B;

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance to anyone who provides feedback. Sorry if some of my statements above seem naive, I'm really new to all of this. I've heard different things about what age we'll be able to adopt the puppy and how long the puppy can be left alone, so I have some questions related to those issues:

\-Do we have to adopt from a breeder at 8 weeks or can we get a puppy at 12 or 16 weeks? If we get the puppy later will we run the risk of getting the runt of the litter?

\-How long can a puppy be left alone during the day? We want to be good to the puppy but not lose our jobs as well!

&lt;p&gt;* Definitely snuggly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Eager-to-please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* We expect the dog will bark when someone approaches the house, rings the bell, etc. We have no problem with that. We&amp;#39;re not looking for a guard dog so we expect the dog will be able to be friendly or at least not aggressive with visitors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* We will do what we have to do but we would prefer not to have an aggressive dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The dog must be safe with small children. We&amp;#39;d rather not have a dog that ate everything in sight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* My wife and I are professionals and we work downtown much of the week. At least three days a week the dog will be home alone between 9-5. We are willing to get a dog walker for those three days and we understand that we will not be able to leave the dog for eight hours when it is a small puppy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The boys just want a snuggly dog they can play with. Me too. My wife is basically on the same page as me but she&amp;#39;s nervous about how we will handle a puppy. We all plan to take care of the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* No  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Yes. Two small boys ages 5 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* No  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* We live in the DC suburbs on the Maryland side. We&amp;#39;re not aware of any laws banning breeds but we doubt we&amp;#39;d want any breed that has been banned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Typical disgusting DC area weather. 30-40ish and raining much of the winter. Hot and humid in the summer. Truly the worst climate of any place that has all four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* No additional information.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26) Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance to anyone who provides feedback. Sorry if some of my statements above seem naive, I&amp;#39;m really new to all of this. I&amp;#39;ve heard different things about what age we&amp;#39;ll be able to adopt the puppy and how long the puppy can be left alone, so I have some questions related to those issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Do we have to adopt from a breeder at 8 weeks or can we get a puppy at 12 or 16 weeks? If we get the puppy later will we run the risk of getting the runt of the litter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-How long can a puppy be left alone during the day? We want to be good to the puppy but not lose our jobs as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for any advice.&lt;/p&gt;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, my wife and I both grew up having dogs and we previously had what we think was a lab/great dane mix until he passed a few years ago.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We are open to either option but definitely want a puppy. Going through a breeder is probably the most appealing to us so we know the dog’s history, etc though.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Our ideal dog would be one who enjoys being active but is content relaxing at home with us often as well. A dog that enjoys fetching, hiking, and generally being active would be great. Also a dog who doesn’t shed too much would be perfect.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Based on my research and looking for a dog with minimal shedding, ones that have come up are lagotto romagnolo, standard poodles, various poodle mixes (I know the argument against these), would love a golden as well if it wasn’t for the long hair/shedding. The spoos are looking more and more appealing but the preconceived notions about them and their looks make them not our first choice. Also I am a bit concerned about getting a spoo and it being too active/neurotic.
We are very open to suggestions in this area though!

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Sit, stay, heel, ability to walk off leash and come on command, essentially just well behaved in general.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No we are not interested in any of these things.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I would say 1-2hrs max. We aren’t looking for a dog that requires constant attention to be content. I know that in the beginning training will take more time which is fine.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2 x 30 minute or so walks a day at a minimum. Frequent trips to the dog park. Hiking with us on the weekend. We are pretty active when we aren’t working and want a dog we can take with us.


9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would be willing to brush daily if necessary. If the dog required frequent grooming/trimming, we could do this at home. With our previous dog we usually trimmed his hair and nails ourselves. We’d be willing to pay a professional a few times a year too.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium would probably be the preference, about 30-60 pounds but this isn’t set in stone.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Preferably no slobber, but a bit of shedding and barking isn't a huge issue. Ideally not too much of any of these though.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This isn’t enormously important but would be great if they could be trained to do this. There are areas where we hike that dogs can be off leash but must be able to come on command.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly but not super needy. We’ve watched some dogs that always want to be right under you and that gets old quick.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager-to-please is great, but some independence would not be a bad thing either.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Protection is not a huge deal where we live, but interactions with strangers and visitors should be positive rather than aggressive.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

We’re willing to manage but this wouldn’t be ideal at all.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

We plan on having a baby around in the next year or two so any sort of aggression towards known people wouldn’t be tolerable. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

The dog will be left alone during the day, in a normal 9-5 M-F situation at this point. It’s possible one of us could be working at home in the next few years though.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

The other person in the house is my wife who has similar preferences and we will share the responsibility.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

We aren’t planning on having any other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes it will, especially once we have a baby.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No we don’t plan to rent.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Where we live pit bulls are banned.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Typical summer day is 80-90 degrees and winter is around freezing or a bit warmer. It always cools off at night in the summer though.

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Every time I go there, I always see multiple people with their dog off the leash. It is NOT a dog park and there are signs that say all dogs must be on leash, which I don't know if these ignorant people don't know or just don't care. I don't give a shit if your dog is good and pays attention to you and is obedient, because if they see a rabbit run across the street and the dog is in *hunting mode*, they're not going to listen to squat! I got my dog as a young adult (4) and he was abused and a stray, so he wasn't socialized with other people or dogs. He doesn't bite, he just barks because he gets scared (which he calms down once I pick him up), but that's for other people. Yes, I do socialize him with friends and family that he hasn't met and the process to do so is time consuming and the new person needs to do what is needed so he doesn't get frightened. I obviously can't do this with a person I walk by on the street, so I pick him up or cross the street/move away from them, and (hopefully) they understand and don't move towards us or use a baby voice that sets him off. When it comes to other dogs, I can't pick him up because it's a dumb thing to do with another dog because they think my dog is a toy or something. If the other dog is on leash, I just move the opposite direction, if they are off leash, however, I simply can't do this. I'll give some examples of instances of other off-leash dogs and my, on leash dog:



1.) I was walking in an alley way and this loose dog ran up and went to sniff my dog (who was sniffing or eating grass or something). This loose dog was nice and playing with my father's dog who loves other dogs and was a huge, mastiff like dog. My dog jumped around, frightened, and snapped at him, scaring him off.




2.) I was walking on a trail when I saw these 2 full sized poodles running at us. They didn't want to be aggressive, they just wanted to see my dog, which is natural. I see them run across the street (a car was coming and almost ran one of them over) and my dog got startled and started to panic and bark and try to run away, which the poodles kept following him. I was about ready to yell at the ignorant owner, who was just casually walking towards us, but she called them back. 



In all, I don't care what your reason is why your dog is off leash, but it is dangerous to the dog, other people, other dogs, and even to the owner, who could chase after them and could get hit by a car, fall and hurt themselves, or any other reason. I don't care if you're walking your dog in a public field or park, in a neighborhood, or in an unfenced yard, you are a dick. What if it got hit by a car, or attacked an on-leash dog or attacked a person, or just ran away? The ONLY public place your dog can be off leash is a dog parm, but anywhere else is unacceptable!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go in this field by my house, because we track rabbits in it, him being a beagle, and usually go in the morning while the weather is still cool.

It is NOT a dog park and there are signs that say all dogs must be on leash, which I don&amp;#39;t know if these ignorant people don&amp;#39;t know or just don&amp;#39;t care. I don&amp;#39;t give a shit if your dog is good and pays attention to you and is obedient, because if they see a rabbit run across the street and the dog is in &lt;em&gt;hunting mode&lt;/em&gt;, they&amp;#39;re not going to listen to squat! I got my dog as a young adult (4) and he was abused and a stray, so he wasn&amp;#39;t socialized with other people or dogs. He doesn&amp;#39;t bite, he just barks because he gets scared (which he calms down once I pick him up), but that&amp;#39;s for other people. Yes, I do socialize him with friends and family that he hasn&amp;#39;t met and the process to do so is time consuming and the new person needs to do what is needed so he doesn&amp;#39;t get frightened. I obviously can&amp;#39;t do this with a person I walk by on the street, so I pick him up or cross the street/move away from them, and (hopefully) they understand and don&amp;#39;t move towards us or use a baby voice that sets him off. When it comes to other dogs, I can&amp;#39;t pick him up because it&amp;#39;s a dumb thing to do with another dog because they think my dog is a toy or something. If the other dog is on leash, I just move the opposite direction, if they are off leash, however, I simply can&amp;#39;t do this. I&amp;#39;ll give some examples of instances of other off-leash dogs and my, on leash dog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) I was walking in an alley way and this loose dog ran up and went to sniff my dog (who was sniffing or eating grass or something). This loose dog was nice and playing with my father&amp;#39;s dog who loves other dogs and was a huge, mastiff like dog. My dog jumped around, frightened, and snapped at him, scaring him off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) I was walking on a trail when I saw these 2 full sized poodles running at us. They didn&amp;#39;t want to be aggressive, they just wanted to see my dog, which is natural. I see them run across the street (a car was coming and almost ran one of them over) and my dog got startled and started to panic and bark and try to run away, which the poodles kept following him. I was about ready to yell at the ignorant owner, who was just casually walking towards us, but she called them back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, I don&amp;#39;t care what your reason is why your dog is off leash, but it is dangerous to the dog, other people, other dogs, and even to the owner, who could chase after them and could get hit by a car, fall and hurt themselves, or any other reason. I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;re walking your dog in a public field or park, in a neighborhood, or in an unfenced yard, you are a dick. What if it got hit by a car, or attacked an on-leash dog or attacked a person, or just ran away? The ONLY public place your dog can be off leash is a dog parm, but anywhere else is unacceptable!&lt;/p&gt;

 1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will not he my first dog, I have significant experience owning/training dogs, have worked in shelters to socialize and train rescue dogs in the past. 

  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * Reputable breeder. I have rescued in the past, but my circumstances are different now. 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.


    * Friendly with people and animals, velcro dog, trainable, happy personality, enjoys walks and outdoor adventures but isn't hyperactive in the home. The dog will be with me at work, surrounded by other dogs and people, so he must be friendly with everyone. I know much of this comes down to early socialization, which is partly why I want to get a puppy from a reputable breeder. Low prey drive is also important. 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?


    * I love ALL DOGS. It's so hard to decide. I'm leaning toward havanese at this point because I think they line up best with my needs. I want a small breed because I have a rabbit. (I know large breeds can be gentle, but the possibility of accidents is higher with a dog that can take out a rabbit with just its paw.) Also, the dog will accompany me to work on public transit every day, so a small dog is easier. 
I also love toy poodles and papillons, but they may be a bit too hyperactive. Am open to all breeds. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?


    * Basic obedience. 

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?


    * No plans for sporting or work. 

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?


    * The dog will be with me at work, so I'll be with him all the time. But in terms of active interaction (playing/training), probably about 2 hours on weekdays, more on weekends. 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  


    * 1 hour a day, walking. No dog parks since I want a small breed and I'm not comfortable having a very small dog in a dog park. 

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?


    * I'm willing to brush daily and do basic trimming at home, or pay a professional. High grooming needs are not a problem. 

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?


    * Toy/small. 

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?


    * Shedding is fine, slobber is also fine for a small dog. I do not want an excessively yappy dog. An alert bark is fine. 

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?


    * Not important. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?


    * Snuggly. 

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?


    * Eager-to-please. 
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  


    * I want him to be friendly with everyone. An alert bark when someone knocks on the door is fine. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?


    * No. I mean, yes, I'll manage any dog that begins showing signs of dog aggression and have done so in the past. I won't give the dog away or anything. But I want to avoid dog aggression at all costs. This dog will be with me at work, around other dogs. 

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?


    * High prey drive and human aggression. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?


    * Pretty much never. 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 


    * My girlfriend can help care for him and her preferences are the same as mine. 

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?


    * Yes, I have a rabbit and would prefer a dog that doesn't actively try to kill it. Of course, they won't be unsupervised together. 

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?


    * We don't have kids now, but plan to have them in the future, so I do want a dog that is safe around young chileren. 

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?


    * No, we own our home. 

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?


    * United States, no breed bans. 

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?


    * We are in the Pacific Northwest, so it's a moderate climate. 

    **Additional Information and Questions**

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.


    * I do NOT want a brachycephalic dog such as a pug, Japanese chin, shih tzu, or French bulldog. They are sweet dogs but I just don't believe that it's humane to breed dogs for this trait. 

   Thanks in advance for any advice!

My dog has mild environmental allergies that are controlled with benadryl on instruction from my vet.  She would scratch at her stomach giving herself red areas of irritated skin.   To start, she needed the benadryl 3 times a day and we kept at that schedule for probably 4 weeks or so.  I was able to back off to twice a day and she still was doing fine.  She seemed to be hardly itching at all anymore so I skipped a day entirely but then went back to just once a day starting last week.  That seemed fine.

Since I first noticed the scratching and started the benadryl she has not had a bath at all.  I really only bathe her when she needs it which is only every few months.  She was starting to get a bit smelly to me so I gave her a bath on Monday and its as if I opened the gates of allergy hell on my poor dog.   It was the same shampoo she's been bathed in previously, which is  Burts Bees mild oatmeal shampoo for puppies.  Its never been an issue.   She started itching a lot that day and by the end of the day I noticed many red spots on her belly to between her back legs.  I immediately got her back on the 3 times a day benadryl.  Its been three days now and the itching isn't as bad but the red spots remain and I also noticed she's got a hint of a hot spot forming on her hip which she's never had before, although I haven't seen her licking that area in particular.

I can't figure out what went wrong...could it actually be that the bath washed off some sort of protective layer of natural oils or something that was keeping her itching at bay?   I've been wiping her down with a cool cloth, I have an tea tree and aloe spray for dogs that is supposed to relieve itching and I've been using neosporin on the worst looking patch between her front legs.  Should I take her to the vet or give it a bit longer before doing that?  Is there anything else I should be doing or am I doing what there is to be done right now?

Hello, this is my first time posting hopefully its alright aha. My dog mika who is 3 years old mix breed, her usual behavior is loving and always sits on the couch or relaxes on her own bed, but recently she just moved the cut off corner of the room behind the couch or under my desk and is hesitant to move from there.

The only thing that changed was that I went away for a week on holiday and I took her to my parents, Unfortunately half way through the holiday.

I called to check up on her but it turns out my parents dog ( my old dog ) attacked mika because of a fight over food or toys ( we couldn't pin down the proper reason ) which is upsetting but they said they took mika to the vet and that she is fine but I have noticed little scabs on her body which I suspect was my other dog. My parents played it off like it was just a barking match and now I think its something else.

Since then she's adopted this new behavior is anything I can do ? She's back at mine and safe with no other pets just me and my girlfriend

**Background**

 So my dog seems to be fine in every regard except when she has to climb or jump up on anything, which she no longer seems to be able to do. She is a service dog, so this was really apparent as she frequently has to hop in an out of my car and has never had an issue in the past but now she has trouble even going up stairs. My vet recommended severely restricting her activity and gave a prescription for an anti-inflammatory to see if it is a soft tissue problem. She is only 3 years old and is is great health otherwise.

**No Play Makes Shadow a Dull Dog**

 I am in day 5 of the 14 day bedrest and my dog is already starting to protest the lack of movement/ change in routine. Nothing severe, but it is small things like opening the recycling cabinet and removing one item to place on the floor and just generally looking at me and sighing.

My problem is that she has never seemed that interested in low impact activities like toys or bones and while I have been doing a bit of training to keep her mind occupied- I am even kind of limited in that I don't want to do anything that requires to much movement. I do use kongs and other puzzle like toys to put her food in when not training but that only seem to be able to engage her for limited periods of time. I have even frozen those suckers with some peanut butter but she still goes through in no time.

The location of the house isn’t far from where Hyuna and I used to live. The house we moved into is actually right behind. The smells of the houses and the surrounding area hasn’t changed much.

In the previous house, Hyuna usually has her food and water outside (my parents doesn’t like having her food inside), sleeps inside (on a different bed) and she gets showered either every week or fortnight. However, even if I don’t shower her in between those times, she doesn’t have that wet dog smell.

In the new house, Hyuna has her food and water inside but has a water bowl outside, still sleeps inside but on a different bed (bed used to be from outside undercover cause it couldn’t fit in my previous room) and her shower consistency are still the same.

Hyuna used to have ticks and flies but we have gotten rid of them. 

However, lately, Hyuna has started to have a wet dog smell and I’m not sure why. What could be the causes and/or triggers of this?

TL:DR: Recently moved into a new house and my dog has started to smell. Why??","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I moved to a new house with my partner and with my dog, Hyuna (5 y.o cross-kelpie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of the house isn’t far from where Hyuna and I used to live. The house we moved into is actually right behind. The smells of the houses and the surrounding area hasn’t changed much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous house, Hyuna usually has her food and water outside (my parents doesn’t like having her food inside), sleeps inside (on a different bed) and she gets showered either every week or fortnight. However, even if I don’t shower her in between those times, she doesn’t have that wet dog smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new house, Hyuna has her food and water inside but has a water bowl outside, still sleeps inside but on a different bed (bed used to be from outside undercover cause it couldn’t fit in my previous room) and her shower consistency are still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyuna used to have ticks and flies but we have gotten rid of them. &lt;/p&gt;

But we did it. We drained the checking account and setup a CareCredit account and it was worth it. You were healthy. You had quality of life.

And what a life we had together. Runyon Canyon. So many beach trips. Overcoming your fear of the water. Hearing Obama speak. Flying on a 737. By my side in federal court, state court. Cross-country road trip in a Porsche. Playing in the snow in Utah. Hanging out at the office in Beverly Hills, and nomming on Sprinkles doggie cupcakes. Flying to Sedona for Christmas. Flying to St. Louis to meet the family (a couple of times!). Flying to Utah to hike around the 4th of July. Harvesting grapes. Hanging out at vineyards, and wineries. Snuggles with me and Astrid, your street-stray adopted sister. Enjoying steak at Hitching Post II.

My rock. My best friend. My everything, my savior on so many occasions. A reason to get out of bed every morning when I wasn’t sure I had one. My erstwhile companion. Rest in peace, buddy boy. You weren’t a good dog. You were the best. You’re gone, so suddenly, and I’m devastated.

She&amp;#39;s also been terrified of fireworks her entire life and even had to be sedated to calm down this time of year for a few years, and she wasn&amp;#39;t remotely phased by them today, not one bit. I know she&amp;#39;s not deaf. I swear she&amp;#39;s like a completely different dog! I still love her so much, and I think that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s hard to feel like she doesn&amp;#39;t care for me anymore.
I don&amp;#39;t want the last years or months of her life to be like this. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose her feeling bitter or sad about this time. How do I get over this?&lt;/p&gt;

TODAY IS THE FOURTH OF JULY :

Today is the single most dangerous day of the year for dogs and other fuzzy friends.

Make certain before the fireworks start, you have a soft safe place set aside for your furry family members; it should be away from doors and windows, comfy but with easy access...many dogs I work with feel comfortable in bathrooms for some reason, but even if its just a crawlspace under the stairs. Go ahead (now is as good a time as any) and find a place, lay down some comfy blankets and toys and maybe a treat or two, and show it to your fuzzy buddies. Do this early because you never know when your neighbors will start firing off fireworks, it may go on at any point and all day and/or night, so earlier rather than later is vital.

When the fireworks start you can help show them the area again so they can snuggle in away from the noise and feel safe. Don't get mad or feel offended when your furry kids don't want to be near you or enjoy in the firework fun; animals have much much better hearing than we do, and we need to take them into account BEFORE the fun starts. Every now and then during the festivities its a good idea to go check and see how your buddy is doing, give them a treat and some love, let them know everything is okay.

Today is a well documented day for animals to suddenly run away, sometimes for days, weeks, or even for good, and even the best trained animals are uncomfortable around these sounds. Some dogs are known to destroy fences, windows or doors in panic, severely hurting themselves and/or running out into traffic. My little grrl is VERY well trained and though she will not run off when fireworks start going if I command her not to, she still shivers in fear from the sounds and eventually will enter a low panicked state. NO DOG likes fireworks, please don't force your buddy to be around them.

Today is one of the three scariest days of the year for your adorable fuzzy family (New Years and Halloween are the other two)...since we cannot sit them down and explain to them that fireworks are fun and a way for us to celebrate and let off steam, on nights like tonight they think the world is ending and fire is raining down from the skies to lay waste to all that is pure and good. Take care of them first, then you can go enjoy the fun and celebrate guilt-free.

I have researched a lot on the surgery and I am worried about all of the complications. I have also heard that a good brace with some therapy may help him. I have a fixed amount of income and am afraid of the cost. I hear anywhere from 2500-7k. I cannot afford that without getting a loan. I feel really bad and not sure what approach to take anyone have ideas? He is 9yo and good size 110lbs so rehab may get tough. Any thoughts on the TPL surgery or if formed braces actually worked Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

On Saturday night, I was walking to the baggage claim  with my mom and dog at the airport and was about to get on the escalator when I heard my dog yelp. I turned around and there was an employee with a wheelchair looking the other way talking to another employee. I wasn't going to outright accuse him of hitting my dog, but a couple behind us said directly to the employee ""you just hit the dog"". Before me or my mom could say anything, the employee ran back to the checkpoint that said ""do not enter"". 

I picked Mowgli up and we walked around until we found someone who we could report what happened to. The man we found was nice enough, but pretty dismissive about the whole thing, saying things like Mowgli is fine (he was very clearly limping. Not consistently, but I was making him walk, so I could see if he was ok). The man said he would report it to his boss in the morning, but me and my said that we want to fill out an incident report. The man insisted that that was not necessary and we insisted otherwise. Finally, he called someone over to bring a form to fill out and it was the same employee that hit Mowgli. The employee apologized, but only wanted us to quickly fill out a form that was clearly not an incident report. We wrote down everything that happened with the date and our signatures and asked if he could fill out the information on the top of the form, which included his information, so we could take a picture. 

This set the employee off. He got very defensive saying that he was not required to give us his information or fill out the rest of the form, but we could take a picture of what we wrote. That wasn't good enough for us, so we kept escalating the situation, asking to speak to someone higher up. He kept denying us this option and finally we said ok and walked away to find someone who could help. 

Me and my mom finally found a very nice employee from a completely different company that was able to get someone to help us. Little did we know, this was actually the first employee we spoke to. Once again, we were told that there was no one we could speak to. Finally, my dad showed up to pick us up and told the man that if he doesn't get someone higher up, we would call the police because my dog was definitely injured and the employee that hit him needed to be held liable. After a bit of back and forth, we finally were able to get two people in charge to come speak to us and give us all of the contact information for the company the wheelchair employee worked for. It was actually the higher up employees idea to go through with calling the cops. A police report was filled out and is now in my possession. 

All of the vets around me weren't able to get me in until this coming Sunday. The only reason we never took my dog to an emergency vet was because he wasn't consistently limping and it stopped up until today. We are going to hold this man/company liable in any way possible if this is more than just a sprain or bruise, but is there anything I can do besides wait and see what the vet says? He already has one luxating patella, but it's the other leg that he is lifting. I'm scared that the appointment is too far away so the company can claim that he was injured elsewhere. We have videos of him limping from that night.

TLDR: airport employee hit my dog with a wheelchair and didn't want to give me and my mom any contact information or an incident report until we threatened to call the cops. Cops were called by higher up employees. Dog is limping. Sad. Confusion.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugh I just need to vent and ask for advice. &lt;/p&gt;

So we both take one dog and run opposite directions then &amp;#39;joust&amp;#39; by running towards each other. The dogs run full speed and meet in the middle where they play fight until one gets tangled or ends up on the ground then we break and do it again. It was super fun Since there was so much running and playing the dogs get tired out quickly and we do too! What do you do to tire your dogs on trips? We are always happy for suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* Not for me, but it is my boyfriend's first dog. I grew up with dogs, but never trained a dog from puppy to adulthood so I'd prefer a more beginner dog. My parents have a 13 year old shih-tzu X poodle, but I was young when we first got him so didn't do much of the training/barely even remember what the training included.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a breeder? \* Preferably a breeder. We're open to a rescue, but we do want to raise a puppy and properly socialize it from the beginning, so that's probably easiest through a breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Our ideal dog is one who does not shed (I have asthma and do need a dog with a hypoallergenic coat. It's been perfect with my family's shih-tzu/poodle), doesn't bark much, and is relatively clean. We know that all dogs bark, and we're willing to put in the work to minimize barking as much as possible, but we live in an apartment (and probably will for the next 10 years) so don't exactly want the condo management sending angry letters. We definitely want a sociable dog who enjoys meeting new people and dogs. Not crazy active, but happy to go on a few hikes (4-5 hours) throughout the year.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* We've been looking at Miniature Poodles because of their intelligence, size, and non-shedding coat. I am interested in the Havanese, but have read that they can experience severe separation anxiety. While we want to be home as much as possible with our new pup, we also want to be realistic and know that we may be away from home for longer periods of time than 4 hours. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* Obviously the basics, but I'm interested in doing some more complex training (especially if we're considering a poodle since they need to be challenged). We'd like to train a dog to stop barking on command. I'm not sure if that's realistic though. A random thing I'd love to train a dog to do: There's a cute trick I've read online where dogs pick up a toy and bring it to the door when someone enters. Not only will this occupy their mouth so they're not barking, but it's just adorable! 

 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* No.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* If this includes cuddle time on the couch and exercise, probably 4-5 hours a day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* Around an hour each day. We live in a walkable neighbourhood and will walk often on leash. We'd like to go to dog parks - on and off leash - a couple times a week. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* We're willing to do quite a lot of brushing. I have bathed my shih-tzu/poodle and groomed it, so am comfortable with giving our dog baths, trimming hair, and brushing. I'm not a professional though, so would be willing to occasionally bring it in if we need a more thorough cleanup. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Small-Medium. We don't want toy breeds, but we don't want large ones. We think a shiba inu is the perfect size (too bad they shed like crazy).

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* No shedding. Minimal barking. Preferably no slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Important! 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* A little bit of both. We want a snuggly dog, but it'll need to be somewhat independent since we're not home all the time.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* More eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Enthusiastically and friendly, but with little to no barking. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. This is partly why I want to get a puppy - so we can socialize it often and frequently during the early days. The shih-tzu/poodle hates puppies and kids, and it's often stressful because he looks super cute and friendly so people start to pet him before asking permission.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* I just really want the dog to be friendly. As much as I love the family shih-tzu/poodle, I wish he didn't have such a big aversion to children or puppies.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* We both work full time, but my boyfriend works night shifts so he'll be home, but will need to sleep. I live closeby, so am able to come back during lunchtime. I also work in a dog-friendly building, but this isn't a permanent career position, so I can't depend on this schedule forever. It's a good way to work around the early puppy stage, but as an adult, ideally, the dog should be able to withstand 8 hours of being alone (with lots of exercise and activity when we're home). We are open to using a doggy daycare if necessary.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* My boyfriend really wants a dog who's very clean. We'll share responsibilities, but I'll be taking care of it more so since he works nights.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* No, and we aren't planning on having more.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but we live in a neighbourhood with lots of kids. We don't want kids in the future.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* We currently rent. No restrictions that we know of, but small dogs are preferable.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* Alberta, Canada. Not aware of any laws.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* It's nice during the summer. Freezing during the winter. We'll need a coat and boots for the dog during the really cold days.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* Because we plan to live in condos for the foreseeable future, it's really important to us that the dog won't feel restricted by the amount of space we have (we'll likely live in around 700 sq ft for a long time).

It’s been a constant battle since the day we adopted her. She only gets into them when we’re not home, so it’s really difficult to correct the behavior. I’m starting to feel at a loss as to how to block her from getting to the litter box. Here’s what we’ve tried so far:

1. Our first home was two stories, so we kept the litter box and cat bowls upstairs. We blocked the staircase with a gate and left the dog downstairs when we weren’t home. However, she eventually discovered she could jump the gate and still get upstairs. 

2. So we bought a tall gate and put it at the top of the stairs. That worked for a while until she figured out how to pull it out of alignment in order to make the door pop open. 

3. We bungee strapped the gate to the banister so she couldn’t pull it off anymore and that worked until she figured out how to wedge her head in the door and pry it open, even when it was locked. So we started bungee strapping the door shut too. 

4. When we moved from that place we moved the gate to our bedroom door and left the little pet door open for the cats (while we packed and moved boxes down the stairs). We learned pretty quickly that she can wiggle herself through the pet door, so we knew the gate in a door frame would never be a permanent solution. 

5. Our second home was a single story with only one bathroom. Since we already knew we couldn’t count on using the gate as a barrier we bought a litter box cover that looks like a small bench/cabinet. It has a hole cut on the side for the cats to enter and the litter box sits on the far side from the hole. Cool. Except the freaking dog can still reach in, pull the litter box over, then stick her head in to eat the poop!

6. We finally got a (very small) cat door so the cats have access to go outside, so we started closing the bathroom door when we’d leave the house. This worked really well until she discovered where the cats were going to the bathroom outside.

7. We recently moved and we’re in a two story townhouse again. The way the staircase is designed, we won’t be able to put up the gate with multiple bungee cords to secure it in place like we had before. I’ve already tried putting the gate up in the bathroom door and strapping something to the pet door in order to make the hole smaller. But I’m pretty sure she still tried to go through, got her head stuck, and when she pulled back it pulled the entire gate down. 

I don’t know what to do anymore! I’ve been looking at dog proofed litter boxes online, but I can still see her getting past them if she really wanted to. She’s so damn persistent and so smart! I’m about ready to go get an invisible fence for the bathroom so she keeps her distance. 

Does anybody have any advice or recommendations? Anybody dealt with a similar issue and figured out a solution? I’m desperate here!

But based on my (limited) understanding of behavioral science, it seems like there are some issues with it.

Many times it seems that ""reactive"" is just the new word for what would have been called an ""aggressive"" dog in the past. That's not necessarily a problem in and of itself, and may be an improvement. ""Aggressive"" wasn't any more clear a description of behavior, and it sounds a lot scarier than ""reactive"". Although sometimes that fear may be warranted based on behaviors being labelled ""reactive""...

It seems to me that an approach based in behavioral behavioral science could be to make a clear and concise statement describing the behavior in the most basic terms. The more specific, measurable, and observable the better. Something like ""when I am walking my dog and approach within 50 feet of a man with a hat, my dog barks 10 to 15 times and pulls hard on the leash, towards the man"" seems much more descriptive and useful, from a behavioral standpoint.

My understanding is that this approach is preferable for a few reasons. First off, two people can communicate this way and will always have a clear understanding of what is being said. If I just said ""my dog is reactive"", we don't really have any information about what the actual behavior is we want to change. Secondly, this gives us clear criteria to work with to change the behavior. We can describe the behavior we want to see ""I want my dog to be able to walk within 5 feet of a man in a hat without barking or pulling on the leash"", and come up with a plan to get there that has clear criteria and can be reinforced with incremental goals (5 barks, 0 barks, 40 feet, 30 feet, 20 feet, 10 feet, etc).

Anyways, hopefully I've done more here than just complain about a word I don't like. As far as I can tell, it's used by trainers who seem to really know their stuff and be quite committed to behavioral science. If people are using it to communicate in a way they both understand, it has at least some value. However I do think that any real behavioral approach to the situation is going to need to more clearly define the behavior anyways, so there might not be a lot of sense in using the term ""reactive"".

I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this. Maybe I'm way off base, or really misunderstanding behavioral science (I'm certainly no expert).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like the term &amp;quot;reactive&amp;quot; is widely used and accepted both on this forum and in the wider (internet, at least) dog interested community.&lt;/p&gt;

I am looking to purchase a puppy and have been talking with the breeder about how over-vaccinating dogs are common nowadays and most vaccines only need to be done once in their lifetime. They state that vaccinating on a yearly basis can potentially cause health problems for the dogs. Has anybody else come across this before? It is the first I have heard about it and they are wanting me to agree with it before purchasing the puppy.

They have a lot of information on the subject on the site and while they post articles about it most are pretty old or from one source (dogsnaturallymagazine.com). While it's not fully don't vaccinate, it more takes the approach of vaccinations last many years (potentially the entire dog's life) and the yearly boosters are unnecessary.

I am doing my own research now (this concept is new to me) and was curious if other people are aware of this or know a bit more about it.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking to purchase a puppy and have been talking with the breeder about how over-vaccinating dogs are common nowadays and most vaccines only need to be done once in their lifetime. They state that vaccinating on a yearly basis can potentially cause health problems for the dogs. Has anybody else come across this before? It is the first I have heard about it and they are wanting me to agree with it before purchasing the puppy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a lot of information on the subject on the site and while they post articles about it most are pretty old or from one source (dogsnaturallymagazine.com). While it&amp;#39;s not fully don&amp;#39;t vaccinate, it more takes the approach of vaccinations last many years (potentially the entire dog&amp;#39;s life) and the yearly boosters are unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am doing my own research now (this concept is new to me) and was curious if other people are aware of this or know a bit more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

Long-time lurker here, first time poster, feeling pretty desperate for some potty/poop training advice.  I have seen similar questions posted here and read through the advice, which has been great, but doesn't seem to be working and may not apply fully to our situation.

Our dog (a 2 y/o Shih Tzu/Lhasa Apso mix), refuses to go to the bathroom (poop or pee) in the lovely fenced in backyard of the home we recently purchased and have been living in for approximately a month. We have had our dog for a little over a year. When we adopted him, we lived in a third floor apartment with no yard. When we got him he had very few accidents in the house despite being allowed to roam free while we were gone from the beginning (we had a kennel, but he showed some very serious disdain and fear towards it, so we ditched it). By all accounts he seemed to be potty trained (we adopted him from a shelter and know nothing about his background). While living at the apartment we took him out on a walk four times a day to do his business. There were a ton of dogs living at our apartment complex, and he was always sniffing around for other dog scents and doing his business on top of them, marking his territory.

Now, at the house, we are letting him outside the same amount of times (at least four per day) but he refuses to go in the backyard and will only go on a walk. One of the reasons we purchased the home was for the dog, and obviously since we have a backyard we do not want to take him for a walk every time. For awhile we gave in and went for walks at the house so that he would be able to relieve himself. In the past couple of weeks we have put our foot down and decided there will be no more walks until he learns to go in the backyard. It's not going well. Despite not having another option, he still will not go in the backyard and instead is now going in the house. He will hold it for hours, which worries me that he'll get some kind of urinary infection or something. I have limited his access to only the kitchen during the day, but every day I come home for lunch and after work I'm cleaning pee and poop from the kitchen floor. 

As mentioned above, he would always pee over other dog's scents at the apartment. He still does this on the walks we take him on. The only time I have had success getting him to poop/pee in the backyard was when I had my friends bring their three big dogs over to go to the bathroom all over the yard. This worked for about a day and half but then he stopped going back there after that. 

We have tried walking him around the backyard with a leash with very minimal success (has peed a few times, but still has accidents in the house the same day), bring treats into the yard with us (hot dogs - his favorite!), use word association, all that. Nothing seems to be working.

Thoughts? Ideas? I'm trying to stay patient, knowing the move has been a big adjustment for him, but getting quite frustrated and discouraged.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: moved from apartment to house, dog refuses to go pee or poop in backyard. Wants to go on a walk and pee over other dog's scents. Has been trapped in the kitchen until we can get this figured out, and poops and pees in the kitchen every day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, dog people of Reddit.

I don’t like to let my girls outside to go to the bathroom unattended before 7am because they bark occasionally at squirrels and birds, and I try to be courteous to my neighbors. So since it was 5am, and the girls had gone to the bathroom at midnight before, I knew they’d be fine until 6:30 or so when I could go out with them. I also didn’t want to listen to tug-of-war or squeaky noises until I turned this document in, because I needed to focus, so I put them both in their crates in our guest room off from my office. No big, they’re both crate trained and walk in with a command. They settle in and I get to work. 

After 15 mins  I hear my 3 year old golden let out two small barks. I figure it’s been awhile since she’s been in the crate when she knew I was home, and so she probably just wanted to be out with me. I don’t even look up from my computer, let out a “shhh!” And carry on. A few minutes later, I hear some shuffling around. Normally they’re really quiet in their crates, totally comfortable in there—but I’m freaking out about this deadline so it barely registers. Then I hear the clang of one of them pawing at the door for a few seconds. Again, “shhh!” from me. All is quiet for the next few minutes. 

And then I smell it. The distinct smell of dog poop, impossible not to recognize. I go in there and my golden—who has NEVER had an accident in her life—is huddled as close as she can get into the front corner of her crate, looking sadly at me. Behind her, all of her blankets and her favorite stuffed toy... just COVERED in diarrhea. Her floofy pants, her tail, they have shit in them.

I got her outside immediately and she went some more. Called my fiancé and it turns out when he went shopping for her wet food yesterday, they were out, so he grabbed a substitute and gave her that for dinner last night. I’m thinking that’s the culprit but keeping an eye on her, of course, and will call the vet if she has another episode.

So now I just finished cleaning diarrhea off of the wire in the back of her crate, which took forever because she tried her hardest to like... go *outside* of it, the poor little thing, so it was alllll up in those little spaces, and I’m just like... ya know what, I deserve this; this is what I get for not listening to her when she was trying to tell me something :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working on a time-sensitive document very early this morning and majorly stressed out about it.

* Other days, we will be more present, and I can go home at launch to take care of it.

I knew there were challenges, I knew there would be a lot of chewing and barking and pooping and I accepted that. I just didn't anticipate her (seemingly) trying to fight me every step of the way to peaceful cohabitation. 

She runs when I pick up her harness. She runs when I pick up her leash. She runs when I put my shoes on. She runs when I put my coat on. She runs when I try to pick her up. She fights me when I do manage to pick her up. She fights me when I try to cuddle her. She runs when I pick up the treats!! Because apparently that means I'm up to no good. What kind of dog runs from treats?! 

And you know what? She loves walks! She loves meeting new people and sniffing things and running around. She loves it so much if I open the door she's half way down the street before I can blink! 

She just doesn't like her harness. Not even the *wearing* of the harness, just the putting it on. That's it. That's all. And somehow that has bled into literally everything to where I can't even give her a treat without her suspecting foul play. Today I had her harness on and she hid behind the washing machine from the leash because she associates that with her harness *even though she already had it on*!! 

I can't not let her go outside because she turns into an unholy terror, and I can't get her outside because she runs from anything and everything to do with her harness! Yes I've bought her a new harness. No joy. Yes, I've bought her a collar, but I'm trying not to traumatise her with that too and training is going really slow because again: she runs from her freaking treats and me and everything!!! Yes, I've bought her a *third, different* harness but it's not arriving till friday. And then we still have to train her with the new one which is going to take freaking weeks if her collar is any indication!!!

I don't know what I want with this post flair, maybe advice I dunno. I'm just trying to do the right thing. I just want to be able to cuddle my dog without her feeling trapped and fighting me because I might potentially put a harness on her for effs sake. How do I get her to understand harness/leash=walk=good? Thanks for letting me rant.

What can I do to give this dog the good, happy life my brother wanted to give him?

&lt;p&gt;In September my brother was hospitalized and they only really saw each other when it was okay to bring the dog there. This precious pup has been with me ever since. A couple weeks later my brother passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do to give this dog the good, happy life my brother wanted to give him? He seems to have adjusted okay, except he won&amp;#39;t leave my side and gets really sad when I leave, which isn&amp;#39;t often since I work from home. My dad watches him and sometimes he won&amp;#39;t eat if I&amp;#39;m not here. I&amp;#39;ve just been trying to keep up the routine that he had with my brother, take him to his favorite spots and stay active, get regular vet and groomer visits, play with him as much as I can, and give him his favorite toys and treats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I can or should be doing to give him a good life? A long life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if these are dumb questions. Everything has been an adjustment for me, but this little guy is the one thing I have to get right. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

My Brussels Griffin female, Ruby, 14 years old but extremely healthy, had to go to the ER last night. She was panting very fast and has never done that her whole life so I took her to the ER at 1 AM and was told that all of the ERs were flooded with dogs with anxiety problems because of Fourth of July week and sounds that they can hear that we can't hear. She was given a painkiller, a nausea shot, and we took home trazodone which I administered to her this morning. 
This afternoonI left her with someone at home for a couple hours and came back with chicken and rice as the doctor directed. I bathed her as well. 
Last nights of the painkiller shot they gave her had her so clumsy she could barely walk and today the trazodone just seems to have her very sedated. My worry is that she is not drinking water or eating the chicken and rice and she has had diarrhea since yesterday.
The vet has told me that they are jampacked with people with dogs going through the panting and anxiety and that it's because of the holiday week, but I am worried about Ruby beyond words. This is my best friend and I don't know if I am overthinking it and it's normal for dogs to have sick days like this or if I should be back at the ER again. 
I'm sure you guys all know how I feel, but Ruby is my best friend and I've called the hospital and they're going to give me some medicine for the diarrhea and said to watch her for three days but if anybody can let me know if their dogs are getting sick because of the supposed fireworks that I can't hear.

She was panting very fast and has never done that her whole life so I took her to the ER at 1 AM and was told that all of the ERs were flooded with dogs with anxiety problems because of Fourth of July week and sounds that they can hear that we can&amp;#39;t hear. She was given a painkiller, a nausea shot, and we took home trazodone which I administered to her this morning. 
This afternoonI left her with someone at home for a couple hours and came back with chicken and rice as the doctor directed. I bathed her as well. 
Last nights of the painkiller shot they gave her had her so clumsy she could barely walk and today the trazodone just seems to have her very sedated. My worry is that she is not drinking water or eating the chicken and rice and she has had diarrhea since yesterday.
The vet has told me that they are jampacked with people with dogs going through the panting and anxiety and that it&amp;#39;s because of the holiday week, but I am worried about Ruby beyond words. This is my best friend and I don&amp;#39;t know if I am overthinking it and it&amp;#39;s normal for dogs to have sick days like this or if I should be back at the ER again. 
I&amp;#39;m sure you guys all know how I feel, but Ruby is my best friend and I&amp;#39;ve called the hospital and they&amp;#39;re going to give me some medicine for the diarrhea and said to watch her for three days but if anybody can let me know if their dogs are getting sick because of the supposed fireworks that I can&amp;#39;t hear.
Thank you for any and all advice!&lt;/p&gt;

I got home around 5:30, we let him outside around 6, and when we went to let him back in a couple minutes later he was gone. He has only gotten out of the backyard twice before and both times he was waiting by the front door when we went out looking for him. This time he was at the neighbors house again, but came right back. I'm worried that something happened with that neighbor that scared him or made him uneasy. He is no longer shaking, he stopped after my husband let him out to the front yard, but he is acting off. Any ideas?

But not together. Also, I have never owned a big dog, who i trained. 

Backstory: Got my girl from a shelter, where she was being fostered till she was old enough to be fixed, and adopted. They knew the mom was a ""designer"" dog Golden Retriever, and Black Lab. No idea what dad was. To make this short they took the mom from the puppies as soon as they could eat a little, I think 3-4 weeks. I met the mom and she was amazing, and medium sized. 

I got to bring my puppy home, and she has always been shy. She cowers from most new people. Twice she has jumped back and gotten defensive. Once with a man and once with a kid in the park. Never growling, snapping, or anything. Just jumping backwards, looking scared, and ready to defend herself.  Anytime she acts shy I give her time to smell, and get comfortable, then I encourage her with lots of praise to try what scared her. Never forcing, encouraging her to progress.  I did find out the foster simply fed, and watered the puppies, who were in the laundry room. The house was filled with too many other foster animals. 

She has never ever done any of this towards anyone in my family, and close friends. Only strangers. 

Today the kids, and the dog were playing (they are always supervised), when she got tired of playing, she would remove herself, and the kids did not follow (we have taught them to give her her space). She joined in the playing again, my son was being rough, and I reprimand him, he stopped, but after a few minutes got rough again. I was heading over to put him in timeout, when the dog flipped out. She did that snapping growl barking thing. She immediately cowered and ducked from the kids. When I yelled she hopped up, got excited and decided it was a game. She wasn't submitting, and continually running away, with her tounge out, and tail play wagging. I never hurt her, I tap her butt as a ""spanken"". When she gets too rough I roll her onto her side.

 I forgot to say she is big. She is eight months, and can already reach the counter.  She looks very much like a German Shepherd. 
She goes for walks almost every day, usually over a mile. I work on her training at least once a day, usually twice. She has puzzles in the yard, and we play with her all day. I just want to know how to train a dog like this. Since this happened she has been in her Kennel, and has not been allowed out. (Its been four hours, but she doesn't even want out)

My kids come first, but I feel I must be missing something in training or  socializing. I am also trying to teach my son too.

Last December I weened her from Core Wellness (grain-free) over to Wellness Complete Health (Not grain-free) due to the publicized health issues from a grain-free diet. She did well for a full month  but in February she began to get pretty violently ill several times a day, mostly vomiting up pure yellow bile. Other than the vomiting she was completely fine; eating, playing, drinking, pooping, all normal. Took her to the vet, they did an exam and bloodwork- all was negative for issues. They put her on antibiotics, a prescription food, and a probiotic but she continued to be sick for a full 9 days. I took her back to the vet, they did a stool sample this time, more bloodwork and again there were no issues found. I did a quick transition back to her old grain-free food and she started to get better, but then eventually the vomiting started up again. Desperate, I was pointed in the direction of a third food, Grandma Mae’s Country Naturals and this seemed to do the trick!  She’s been on this food for about three months without issue until two days ago. She puked up a baby carrot I gave her (those are her treats, she’s been getting them all her life), then yesterday I came home to several small spots of yellow bile,  and today there was one large spot.  She doesn’t get people food and hasn’t been kenneled  or gotten into anything. Other than the vomiting, she’s acting completely fine. I can’t figure it out and I feel horrible over it. I just want her to be okay, I’m so worried that it could be something serious.

UPDATE:  thank you all for your advice. It seems to have been the heat that was getting to her. Since lowering the ac temp just two degrees while I’m at work, she hasn’t gotten sick again!!  I ordered a cooling pad off Amazon but it hasn’t arrived yet, in the meantime I’ve been putting down the damp towel- sometimes she uses it, sometimes not. I can’t thank you all enough, I feel like an idiot but I never would have figured out on my own that the heat was the root of the problem.

I should also mention that this is a throw away account because I hold a lot of guilt for this.... it just felt better to use one. 

2 years ago my dog passed away in the night. She had been very sick for many years. Not a quality of life affecting thing, because we had it under good control, but a threat regardless. Maybe thats what killed her in the end, I really don’t know. She was my first dog, and we were extremely connected. She was years from the average age of death for the breed. My guilt started the day she died and I have felt overwhelming guilt and sadness from that day when I think about her. I really don’t know what to do.

What brought it up is I’m getting a new dog soon. The new dog is a different breed, size, type, has a VERY different name, basically everything as different as possible from the first. I was looking at toys for her and one reminded me of dog #1. I don’t feel I ever got closure for her death because:

1) the guilt
2) she had an unknown cause of death. At the time I lived with my parents and they didn’t want an autopsy so we didn’t get one. This leads into the guilt I experience
3) I didn’t get to see her after she died. My parents hid her body from me 

The reason for the guilt is.... very complex. A lot of questioning and ‘what ifs’. I didn’t check on her that night, if I did would she still be alive? Should I have noticed something before her death that ended up killing her? Maybe I didn’t spend enough time with her before her death. Did she know I cared? 

Honestly, I’m crying while I right this, so I’m sorry if the grammar is off. I don’t even know what I’m expecting, but I suppose I’m hoping to find someone who went through something similar. I’m hoping to find a way beyond this. I want to be happy when I remember her and be able to remember good times without overwhelming guilt. 

Thank you if you read this far. It’s been a really hard week.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the wrong subreddit I apologize.

He goes absolutely crazy for any chance to get food or a treat. We've had to change his diet a few times now to find a food that wouldn't upset his stomach. The last type of food recommended about 5.5 cups a day for him (\~100lbs) per what was listed on the bag, and that's about what he was getting plus a few treats throughout the day. We just switched to a new food that seems to be helping his stomach (fingers crossed) but it recommends \~3.5 cups a day. Keep in mind, they are both Purina Pro Plan. When I mentioned to my fiance that we needed to dial back how much we were giving him, she didn't agree saying that those recommendations on the bags are not accurate (says our vet told her that). Now, I am not saying she's wrong (*cause she is never wrong - wink*), cause I sure as hell don't know the answer, but I don't see how it shouldn't at least give us a baseline. He shouldn't be getting the same amount of the second food just because that is what he was getting with the previous type.

So last night after giving him his nightly treat, he was acting like he needed more food. However, I can't tell if he really isn't getting enough or if he just thinks he can demand more and maybe we'll give in. There was a little while where we were giving him a small cup right before bed because he now wakes us up around 4am wanting breakfast. About 3 months ago it was 6am and he has slowly worked it back to 4am. Maybe he was just looking to get this cup that he was starting to get used to.

I have a 10 week old puppy. She is a blue heeler/border collie mix. On Sunday, June 22nd, my puppy was playing out at the dog park with another dog and she did a little run over; she yelped once but that was that. The dog left and we played for about 10 minutes and then she kept collapsing and walking sideways. I carried her inside and she then started shaking and wobbling. She was just constantly drooling too. About 20 minutes in, she vomited all she had eaten over the past day. She was coherent, but she couldn't control herself. She didn't stop shaking for about an hour. She napped it off after a couple of hours.

On Tuesday the 23rd, I went to the vet and mentioned what happened. They thought it was heat exhaustion. So then Thursday the 25th rolls around and I decide to take her out to the same dog park. We play for a bit and then two labs come and play. She runs with them and after about 10 minutes, she collapses. I took her in and filled the bath with water to cool her off. She starts shaking and the same symptoms ensue. Nothing helped. I took her out of the bath and let her lay while I got her a bowl of water. She tried following me to the kitchen but stumbled to stand up so I laid there with her. It took about an hour again to stop shaking. She returned to normal after a short nap as well.

On Sunday the 30th, I take her to my friends place; they have a pool they let the dogs play in. I take her out and she plays with the two dogs out there and gets a drink from the pool. After about 5-10 minutes, her legs start to lock up. She waddles over to the grass and pees, then collapses. My friend's dad picks her up and her episode starts. We tried giving her glucose to see if it was blood sugar and that didn't change anything. About 45 minutes into the episode, she squirms out of his hold and lays flat on the concrete. Drool everywhere. She's shaking and ends up vomiting and also pooping uncontrollably. After about 10 minutes, she does this again and pees and poops, while shes shaking and wobbling. We ended up taking her to the emergency vet, but by the time we got there she had napped it off and we were in a long line.

After an hour of waiting we decide to wait until the next day to take her to the regular vet. Today we had the appointment. After explaining it all to the vet, he didn't have a clear answer. Hew was surprised that she was so young and already having seizures. He suggested a couple of things it could be, but in the end suggested we go and see a Vet Neurologist.

My question to you guys is, has anything like this happened to your dogs? Do these symptoms sound like epilepsy or a seizure?

She is about four years old, a cavalier, desexed. She's got a beautiful personality, but every single morning when my parents leave for work she will go crazy barking, sometimes she runs around the house and backyard, other times she just sits in the kitchen barking. 

She doesn't destroy the house or anything and she calms down after about 30-45 minutes and goes to sleep. I've tried bringing her bed into my room, I've tried sitting with her, I've tried giving her treats when she stops barking etc the only time she didn't bark was for about a month there was a cat here and she was scared of the cat.

It's honestly not too huge of a deal, but sometimes I work night shifts and when I'm just falling asleep, my parents leave and the dog starts barking which is a little frustrating. 

My parents know that she does it and they've looked into a few things (even before we moved in because they knew the barking could upset their neighbours) but when people talk about dog anxiety they talk about the dog destroying furniture, carpets etc but their dog doesn't do any of that so we are kind of stuck and not sure where to go from here. 

At first I thought maybe the dog was getting bored because my parents are usually gone for around 8 hours before they get home and give her her walk, but she has lots of toys, a big back yard, I also started taking her for walks on the beach and most mornings ill take her on the drive into town to drop my partner off at work etc

From [“The Risks of Using Ace as a Sedative For Fearful Dogs”](https://www.puppyleaks.com/sedative-for-fearful-dogs/)
&gt; Ace works by blocking the receptors in the central nervous system; and the effects generally last between 6 – 8 hours. During that time many dogs have problems with their coordination; just walking around can be troublesome.
&gt; Your dog will appear sedated but his mind will be fully alert and functioning. Using Ace on a dog with extreme anxiety can make the phobia worse. Your dog will remain anxious and fearful, yet not have the ability to do anything about it because of the sedative effect.

Ace also can pose severe health risks to certain breeds of dogs. 

It also can be a personal safety risk when used to sedate fear-reactive/aggressive dogs as it can make their aggression worse and does not always inhibit a dog’s ability to bite.

We probably should have done more with her but at this point it seems like a lost cause. She’s definitely improved since we first got her though. Once reactive, always reactive...to some extent?

I’m mostly curious why she tries to start stuff with so many dogs when we have her on leash, but she always gets glowing reports from her cage free daycare. We stopped taking her to dog parks because she was starting to get into little tiffs with other dogs. I’ve asked her daycare and they always say she’s fine. I’m always tense when dropping her off because I don’t want her to fight another dog in the reception area while I have her on leash. 

We are moving to a new area and almost all the daycares age cage free. They’ve sent me paperwork where I have to certify that she’s never been aggressive with another dog. I obviously can’t do that because while she’s never gotten into an actual fight with blood, she will definitely growl and lunge. 

She also always targets certain dogs. I would say she reacts to other dogs about 80% of the time on leash. But if we see a dog that is white with blue eyes, she 100% reacts and reacts intensely. 

I’m not sure if she even enjoys going to daycare so maybe I should just let it go. I would like for her to socialize with other dogs besides our 2nd dog, but maybe it’s time to just have someone come and dogsit at our home. They won’t be able to walk her in the neighborhood because she has extreme reactivity to cars. She has to be driven to a secluded location with no cars and preferably not a lot of other dogs.

I recently had a dreadful experience with a breeder and I wanted to share what I've learned from it. I'd like to explain each step where I should've known something was wrong and what I should've done differently in each of those places. I'm hoping other people can learn from the mistakes I made.    
*I'm not an expert and don't know everything, though, and I'm generalizing with most of this! It's been my personal experience and your mileage may vary.*    
 
&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR: Ask right up front if they health test, which tests they do, and at what age they begin to breed their dogs.  Ask them all of the 'hard' questions and get them out in the open, and don't be afraid. You'd think it was common practice to only breed dogs 2+ years old and who've passed their health screenings, but don't do like I did and assume that.**    
 
&amp;nbsp;

 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #1:
I found the breeder through the breeds club website under the referral section, and my mistake here was assuming the breeder was going to be reputable just by association with the club. This was wrong, and most club websites even say, for dummies like me, that they do NOT necessarily endorse the breeders listed, and that you should be a little cautious.     
 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #2:
I like to email breeders, or call if they prefer that, because I can't visit shows often. If I had the option, I'd visit shows a lot more and meet more breeders there. When I had emailed the breeder, I was of the mindset that I really didn't want to be irritating and I just wanted to get a reply. I had sent maybe 15+ emails to different breeders previous to this and only got a few replies back in general, so I was desperate. In my desperation, I slipped up and made mistake #2. I didn't ask the breeder up front about their breeding program (their health testing, ages of dogs being bred, how many litters per year, show/sport/work that she does with her dogs). If I would've asked, and gotten an honest response from her (she turned out to be a bit of a liar), then I would've walked away right then.    
 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #3: 
I should've been cautious when the breeder proudly told me that she 'usually doesn't allow visitors', but that I had sparked her interest and could come over. So, basically, I wouldn't have been invited if I didn't paint dogs for a living already and live 10 minutes away. I've been told by other breeders now, sadly after the experience has already happened, that a breeder should be welcoming to visits and they should want to meet you in person to get to know you, and so you can get to know them as well. A breeder who doesn't allow visitors (and therefore get to know each other) may not be a breeder you want to work with. Not always and not 100% of the time, but for me it's very important. You should be invited to their home to meet them and their dogs openly, not just because you meet some unspecified criteria that doesn't relate to dog ownership.    
 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #4: 
During our visit, I got to meet the bitches that she had at her home (her studs were elsewhere) and we talked about the breed in general. This visit is the critical moment where, if I knew what I know now I'd have ran, but I was being naive. So far I've made a few mistakes in this story, the most important so far being that I didn't ask her up front in our emails if she health tested. This visit would've been the perfect place for me to ask her questions relating to her breeding program, but instead, I was nervous and let her set the pace for conversation topics. I was being too trusting of her and not doing my part as a responsible prospective dog owner, which was to ask these important questions.
I didn't ask her anything directly, so this is my fault, but also it's telling of her as a breeder that she 1) never talked about her dogs achievements or mentioned any work, show, or sports she likes or does with them, 2) completely skipped talking about health testing, minus genetics, which she talked briefly about, and 3) was not completely truthful about some of the information I was given. She told me she had been taking a break from showing for the past few years and only bred infrequently nowadays. I asked how many litters a year she had, since she brought it up, and she said 2, MAYBE 3 at most. 
When she said she hadn't shown in a while but was still breeding, I understood that as she finished titling/working with her dogs and was now breeding them while taking a break from showing her newer ones. That is not what she meant, though.    
 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #5: 
As I said, I completely trusted her and thought she was going to be the one. I assumed she did all of the things I want in a breeder, but I hadn't actually asked her if she did any of the things. I messaged her the next day and asked if I could get on her waiting list, to which she said to get on the list you'd need to pay your deposit for the puppy in advance ($300). This is another critical moment when I should've reconsidered, but I didn't because I thought it was normal/how breeders do things. It's not. It doesn't make sense to put down a $300 deposit to get on a waiting list for puppies who aren't going to be born for another 4 months, plus waiting the 2 months after until they're ready to go home. Why would she accept my money for a litter who may not even be conceived, or where a puppy may not be available for me? My mistake was not thinking this through and for being too eager to get involved and on the list.    
 
&amp;nbsp;


* Mistake #6: This is the last mistake in the story before things erupted into chaos.
I paid the deposit through paypal (she made me pay through family and friends so she could purposefully avoid the fee (against TOS) and so I couldn't force a refund (I didn't know this last bit til later)) and she sent me a receipt after she received the money. On the receipt it says, in tiny writing at the very bottom of the page, ""This deposit is nonrefundable"". Again, long before I paid the deposit I SHOULD have asked about her deposit policy and if she does refunds, and if she doesn't then why not, etc. But this doesn't excuse her for never mentioning in our multitude of emails back and forth after our visit that the deposit was going to be nonrefundable. She withheld that information and used it against me later.     
 
&amp;nbsp;


Then it all kind of unraveled. Later on it was revealed that one of her bitches was pregnant and she'd be giving birth in a few days. The litter we were planned to get a pup from was going to be ready at the end of the year, so it was surprising to us that there'd be one sooner. She left out the name of the sire, so I asked, and she gave me the kennel name of a dog. The name didn't include any titles, and I thought that was a bit odd. I looked him up within the facebook group she'd invited me to, and I found a dog who was not show quality (IMO) and didn't work or do sports. He was co-owned by a pet home who had been doing agility with their other dog. Finally, I saw that he was only a year and 3 months old when he was bred to the dam. She told me afterwards that she started breeding all of her males beginning at this age and her mentors before her did this, and their mentors, etc. Defending herself by saying everyone's doing it, basically.
I dug deeper and counted how many litters she's had over the past few years. She's having 4 or more this year, had 4 last year, and 5 the year before. Double the amount of litters she told me she does, and all of this is while she's not been showing. She's been using her own males from her lines and not anything from other kennels, so no diversity.
Finally, it was revealed after many emails back and forth that the only health testing she does is a genetic screening and hips, and only on a few of her dogs, telling me that it's expensive and she thinks the OFA is a scam basically.
After telling her I wasn't going to go forward with getting a puppy from her, she flipped and wrote me petty things over two emails, including some taunting that she'd be keeping my deposit. She said she was going to keep breeding yearling males and that I'd wasted her time.    
 
&amp;nbsp;

 
&amp;nbsp;


Don't do what I did and be shy and naive, and afraid to irritate a breeder. Ask them right up front questions about their dogs and their breeding programs. These questions shouldn't irritate them, and it will tell you a lot. As for me, I've met a new breeder of a different breed who does extensive health testing (checked her out on the OFA site as well), only breeds dogs 2+ years old, and immediately invited me and anyone else important to me to visit and meet her dogs. They only take deposits when pups are born and when it's confirmed you'll be able to have one. They don't cash checks/your money until after you've had your pup for a week or two just in case anything happens. It's a completely different experience and I can't believe I thought the other breeder was responsible. We visited the new breeder this weekend and are on her waiting list now- a waiting list that you don't have to spend $300 to get on.    
If you're curious, the new breeder that I'm hoping works out for us breeds keeshonden, a breed I've been thinking about for years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been searching for a dog of my own for years and have been trying to find a responsible breeder for almost a year now.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I grew up with a dog but am now graduated from college and in the workforce looking to get myself and my girlfriend a dog. No experience training.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would prefer to rescue.


3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Cuddly, mostly mellow with flashes of energy. Looking for a breed that we can take hiking in San Diego temperature and camping in the Sierra Nevada’s but will be mellow enough in our smaller apartment (650 sq ft). My girlfriend hates large amounts of hair so a short hair would be preferable. I prefer larger breeds but I am aware it’s not quite fair to keep them in a small apartment so we are looking for something medium sized.


4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Bulldogs, Shepherds, Retrievers, Border Collies. We are active people and have both grown up with either a shepherd or a retriever. We have always enjoyed the playful side and the activity of them, but due to size limitations we think we may be able to get the same characteristics out of a French bulldog or something of the sort.


5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Sit, stay, but most importantly listen and be an off leash companion when desired.


6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, we plan to do neither.


**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 or more hours


8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. Girlfriend works from home so a walk in the morning and then a walk in the evening after dinner. Also weekends at the dog beach.


9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I will groom daily.


**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium sized


11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal


12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Important


**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly


14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.


15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Kindly and with discipline. I would like somewhat of a protector but without the display of barking or aggression.


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No


17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing except barking


**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Likely never. My girlfriend works from home and I work a 7-4 shift


19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Girlfriend just wants cuddling and minimal shedding. She or I will likely walk the dog in the morning and we will both enjoy evening and weekends being active with the dog.


20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets


21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No


22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We are renting. No restrictions that we are aware of.


23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* San Diego, CA


24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer: 70F, Winter: 60F

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, we plan to do neither.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Commitments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 or more hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2 hours. Girlfriend works from home so a walk in the morning and then a walk in the evening after dinner. Also weekends at the dog beach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will groom daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium sized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snuggly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kindly and with discipline. I would like somewhat of a protector but without the display of barking or aggression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing except barking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely never. My girlfriend works from home and I work a 7-4 shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girlfriend just wants cuddling and minimal shedding. She or I will likely walk the dog in the morning and we will both enjoy evening and weekends being active with the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No other pets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are renting. No restrictions that we are aware of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Diego, CA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summer: 70F, Winter: 60F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

At our last check up in March I pointed out three lumps that my BC had developed. The vet checked them out, said to keep an eye on them but were probably just fat lumps.

He now has about 6 of them and I'm starting to feel concerned. I have an appointment Thursday morning, but just need some reassurance and/or advice from someone who may have gone through this.

No evidence of pain, he's slowed down a bit, but that started before the lumps developed. I changed his food in the fall as the quality of his previous one was declining. Previous food change was after he had most of his teeth removed in February in 2017

As with most of you, my dog is everything to me and I terrified of losing him and even the decisions that may be coming up (potential surgery, chemo, etc).

Thanks in advance

Edit: Just got back from the vet. She's not concerned about them, but did give me pricing if I want to have them tested.

He’s 17 kilos and the packaging says one per ten kilos so I was kinda suspicious of what she says but whatever, she’s the doc. Well, today is day two. The day started normally.

Howling, pacing around the room, trying to get non-existent food from the counter and knocking stuff over! Just crazy. He did that when he was younger A FEW TIMES, but not nearly for as long as this! The only times he still does this is when he needs to poop, so he zooms around for about five seconds and then goes to his poo spot to poo, and then comes back chill af again. But this time, he had been going at for at least fifteen minutes, I got him to the rooftop where there’s some space to try to play fetch to tire him out so he can calm down but he was still just going around, being uncooperative as ever. He pooped. I thought this would be it and maybe he was just having some trouble and it’s over. But. We went inside. It continued. My mother couldn’t take it, so I told her to take us to the doggy park (we have to go by car, since the nearest dog park is 50 minutes away on foot lol) and we stayed there for 1 and a half hours. He didn’t run around much, but he did chase the ball a few times and went around overall snoopin the place.

But the way he was pacing around... it was exactly how he did when he had to poop. Which isn’t like how he gets the zoomsies. Which made me think that there was something unsettling his stomach. He pooped again about half an hour ago, very small quantity and kept going at his spree until a few minutes ago when he finally laid down.

He pooped again about half an hour ago, very small quantity and kept going at his spree until a few minutes ago when he finally laid down. Do you guys think that there was something else disturbing his stomach, or just the virnains giving him more energy? Or were the vitamins bothering him? Is something else going on entirely? Has this happened to you? WHATS GOING ON!&lt;/p&gt;

Like the title says I want to adopt a Cane Corso (Italian Mastif) but I want to know a few things about the breed from people that own one.

1. How does it get along with other animals (I have another cat)
2. Is it an ""apartment dog"" friendly?

3. How expensive is to maintain (this one is a bit less important because I honestly am crazy about a dog)
4. How stubborn is it to train? (have an episode of Dog Whisperer experience, don't think that counts as dog trainer)

Unfortunately we had to put her down this morning. 

We had noticed her losing weight and her apatite decreasing. We put broth on her food and that helped a little with her eating. 

We had been having to help her up sometimes. Which was okay. Sunday night she went down the stairs into the yard and couldn’t get back up. We figured she’d pulled something so I carried her in. 

Monday she was a bit out of it, she needed to be carried up the steps again. 

The second time I carried her yesterday I knew. She laid her head on my shoulder and sighed as I carried her and helped her in. 

I was in denial, doubting myself on what I know she was saying. 

Finally last night after getting groceries my mom and I came inside and her back legs were sprawled, and she was laying in her own urine. 

We got her up, picked up her bedding to wash it. We all kinda knew. 

We fixed her a hamburger, gave her some cheese and she ate it. She got up herself some to eat some cheese balls we were eating. Cheese was always her favorite. If it had some cheese or cheese flavoring, she was on it. 

After midnight she started visibly not feeling good and we agreed to call the vet first thing if she hadn’t passed in her sleep. 

I woke up at about ten till eight to her trying to get up. I got up and helped her. She was having issues with her hip, trying to kinda limp but the other hip was failing. She was trying to use the tops of her back feet to walk. 

She made it to the back door and used the bathroom on the puppy pads we had. She sometimes had trouble holding it all night. Even in the end she didn’t want to pee where she wasn’t supposed to. She was always a very proud dog. 

She then went to have a bowel movement and fell. She laid on her side and went, that just wasn’t like her. My prideful girl was pitiful and defeated. 

I helped her up, her balance was worse than when we first got to the back door. I helped her on her bed. 

I told my mom to call the vet, and at 10:30 AM, we took her in. That was when they had an appointment.

She laid her head in my lap the short two minute car ride, I pet her and sang to her. It was a beautiful morning. Still is, actually. 

We took her in, carrying her. They got a weight and she only weighed 32Lbs. Not even a month ago she was 37lbs. 

They took us to a room and we laid her on the table, on a plush blanket. We spoke to a new vet, and our older one, the owner of the practice. They both agreed, separately, that it was time. 

Our main vet stood her up, felt her belly which was all swollen. At this point she was trying to stand on the tops of both her back feet. We’d right them and they’d just go back to that, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. 

They sedated her as my mom and I held her, she relaxed and we talked to her. Told her what a good, good girl she was. How she did such a good job. 

We laughed a little as we remembered the time she bit my mother, the one time. I was little and I had skinned my legs. My mom scooped me up and carried me in, I was screaming and blood was running off my legs from my kicking.

Angel thought my mom had hurt me and she bit her, trying to save me. From that day we knew nothing would ever hurt me when she was around. 

Through her false pregnancies she’d treat me as her pup. She’d grab me very gently by the arm and lead me to her bed and make me sit with her. She’d lick me and guard me. If I got up, she followed. 

My mom told her that they did a good job at raising me. My mom and Angel. 

They gave her the injection and within a few minutes she was gone. She passed in our arms, a small little smile on her face. 

She looked so peaceful, so perfect. 

Angelic, just like her name implied. 

I’m going to miss her. I’m in shock kinda. I knew it would be soon but... Man. It’s hard. It’s never easy. 

To my sweet, sweet girl. I love you. Thank you for being *my* dog. Out of the thousands of people that could’ve owned you. You were mine. You came to me. You choose me when you stumbled out of that briar bush, into my tiny, toddler hands. 

I hope you’re running laps again. I hope you’re happy, and I miss you. I’ll always miss you. 

Rest In Peace, Angel. 

2004ish - July 2nd, 2019.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y’all have probably seen my posts gushing about my sweet old girl. Unfortunately we had to put her down this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had noticed her losing weight and her apatite decreasing. We put broth on her food and that helped a little with her eating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been having to help her up sometimes. Which was okay. Sunday night she went down the stairs into the yard and couldn’t get back up. We figured she’d pulled something so I carried her in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday she was a bit out of it, she needed to be carried up the steps again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I carried her yesterday I knew. She laid her head on my shoulder and sighed as I carried her and helped her in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in denial, doubting myself on what I know she was saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally last night after getting groceries my mom and I came inside and her back legs were sprawled, and she was laying in her own urine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got her up, picked up her bedding to wash it. We all kinda knew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed her a hamburger, gave her some cheese and she ate it. She got up herself some to eat some cheese balls we were eating. Cheese was always her favorite. If it had some cheese or cheese flavoring, she was on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After midnight she started visibly not feeling good and we agreed to call the vet first thing if she hadn’t passed in her sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up at about ten till eight to her trying to get up. I got up and helped her. She was having issues with her hip, trying to kinda limp but the other hip was failing. She was trying to use the tops of her back feet to walk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She made it to the back door and used the bathroom on the puppy pads we had. She sometimes had trouble holding it all night. Even in the end she didn’t want to pee where she wasn’t supposed to. She was always a very proud dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then went to have a bowel movement and fell. She laid on her side and went, that just wasn’t like her. My prideful girl was pitiful and defeated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped her up, her balance was worse than when we first got to the back door. I helped her on her bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my mom to call the vet, and at 10:30 AM, we took her in. That was when they had an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She laid her head in my lap the short two minute car ride, I pet her and sang to her. It was a beautiful morning. Still is, actually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took her in, carrying her. They got a weight and she only weighed 32Lbs. Not even a month ago she was 37lbs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took us to a room and we laid her on the table, on a plush blanket. We spoke to a new vet, and our older one, the owner of the practice. They both agreed, separately, that it was time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main vet stood her up, felt her belly which was all swollen. At this point she was trying to stand on the tops of both her back feet. We’d right them and they’d just go back to that, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sedated her as my mom and I held her, she relaxed and we talked to her. Told her what a good, good girl she was. How she did such a good job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed a little as we remembered the time she bit my mother, the one time. I was little and I had skinned my legs. My mom scooped me up and carried me in, I was screaming and blood was running off my legs from my kicking.&lt;/p&gt;

TLDR at the end

I've honestly never been a big fan of all the tennis balls that just lay scattered around dog parks (sometimes for years) for a few reasons that I was never overly concerned about:  they're dirty and grimy, you never know if theres a bug in or on them if your dog grabs the ball before you can (I've seen some things and they've been nasty), when my dog is done running around he'll lay down with a tennis ball and start ripping it apart, they can be a chocking hazard for some dogs, some dogs will resource guard ""their"" toys

Before yesterday I didn't want to bug other people by doing something about the tennis balls because many people and dogs do use and love them and it didn't effect my dog greatly to the point I was concerned (my boy wont even chase a ball if he sees other dogs running after the same one, there's no way he'll try to take aa ball out of another dogs mouth and if another person appeared at the small park I normally go to I always ask if it's ok to have toys out before they open the gate, no big deal right? WRONG. I get to the dog park yesterday with one dog already there and right away my boy was interested in some bushes/weeds/grass inside the park. I didn't think much on this, just thought there was an interesting smell. I open the air lock and my boy goes straight to the bushes been eyeing and the other dog goes after him, and then starts snapping and snarling and trying to bite at him. When my boy takes his head out of the bush he has a grimy old tennis ball in his mouth and now the other dog is going after his face....where he's holding the ball. This is when my boy finally was like, ""wait why are you barking at me and trying to bite me, leave me alone!"" so now my boy is showing teeth and snapped back at the other dog and is now trying to get away so he can go play with the ball. Other dogs owner manages to grab him ( I grab mine too even now he's very much uninterested in other dog and try to check him over a bit to make sure other dog didn't get him) and other owner is aghast, her dog has never acted like this before she doesn't understand what happened, she's very much in shock. I suggest it's because of the ball my dog unearthed but at this point she's frazzled and apologizing and repeating how this has never happened before and how she's taking her dog out of the park she's so sorry, so she didn't even hear me. I'm not blaming the dogs or the owners, and someone else who goes to the park also has a vendetta against the balls because they disappear and reappear, but I do blame the balls and whoever is trying to do a good thing by leaving the balls in the park for the dogs to play with them. I'm not against having a bucket with toys hanging from the fence or outside the park so if someone comes and there's no dogs they can play with their dog, but just having them rolling around inside the park can be dangerous, thoughts/feeling/ anything we can do to get people to put toys in the designated buckets?? (there's also the oposite end of this where this old lady's dog kept grabbing a dirty frisbee to play with and after three times of the dog ignoring ""leave it"" she grabs the frisbee and throws it over the fence and into the woods next to the dog park...right as a family in the park is going ""no, nO, NO, THAT'S OUR FRISBEE!"" from where her dog had originally stolen the frisbee from that family and their dog and they've been subtly trying to get her attention so they could get their toy back)

TLDR: My dog found a tennis ball under a bush before he even made it into the dog park and the only dog in the park at the time made a beline to my dog (who was making a beline to the bush) and started barking, snapping, and biting at my boy when he emerged with a ball and thankfully other dogs owner was attentive and got him right away but was super shaken cause he's never acted that way before (unknown resource guarding problem is what I'm thinking) I think just having tennis balls rolling around inside the park can be dangerous, thoughts/feeling/ anything we can do to get people to put toys in the designated buckets where dogs can't get them without a human getting a toy out first??","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just commented about this in the dog park post that blew up, but what are your thoughts about all those tennis balls rolling around dog parks cause I have a story to share.

Edit:The best way to keep them safe is to keep them indoors

Secure your dog in a fenced yard or on a leash Missing dogs are often the result of an unsecured area or unleashed pet. No matter how well-trained you think your pet is, don't let him wander around outside unsupervised. Many pets get lost or stolen this way. You can prevent a lost dog by keeping him inside a securely fenced yard, or safely tethered to a leash. Fences should be tall for jumping pets, buried at least 6 inches into the ground for digging pets, and without open cracks or loose boards for pushy pets and tiny pets. Invisible fences or pens work for some dogs, but others barrel right through these barriers, not minding the electric shock if it means they get to chase that squirrel. On outings, use a leash and never leave your dog unsupervised. Many dogs get stolen, injured by the tether or other animals, or even strangle themselves when left alone on a leash. Best if kept inside. 

Approaching a Lost Pet
First things first, it’s really important to remember that lost pets are out of their element, and their behavior is often unpredictable. Be mindful of your approach:
Stay calm place food and a recently worn shirt at last seen location. The 
Walk slowly toward the pet.
If the pet starts growling, back away.
Don’t make any sudden movements, like a quick grab for a collar, or you may provoke the pet into aggressive behavior.
If you can approach the pet without scaring it, try talking to it to give it a little reassurance.

If you do not know animal or yours is acting strange or agressive:
Never put yourself at risk when trying to rescue a lost pet. Back away slowly and call animal control for help.
Sick and injured pets are almost always on the defensive, so in those situations, you should call animal control services for help. Even though you want to help, only trained professionals know how to handle these situations in a way that protects the pet and people involved.

When your animal comes to you DO NOT DISCIPLINE for running off. Give them treats and love for coming to you. 

What to Do With a Lost Pet :
You’re standing toe-to-paw with a lost pet, now what? The first thing you need to do is check for a collar and ID tags and immediately call the number on the tags. Often, a pet will have an owner tag and a vet’s tag. Try to call the owner first, and if she doesn't answer, try the vet.

As you may know, many lost pets don’t have collars. Cats generally don’t wear collars and tags, and lost dogs also have a tendency to lose their collars, too. So it’s pretty common to come across a lost pet without a collar and ID tags.

You have a few options for what to do with a lost pet with no form of visible ID:

Take it to a vet clinic or animal shelter to be scanned for a microchip.
If you take the pet to a vet clinic, please be aware that they may not shelter the pet until the owner is located–except maybe in the strange circumstance that it’s one of their patients.
Call a local shelter with animal control services to come and pick up the pet.
Not all shelters have animal control services, so you may have to call more than one.
If a microchip scan positively identifies the pet, then you have to decide whether to keep the pet in your care until the owner arrives or leave it with a shelter. This, of course, is a decision only you can make, and it depends entirely on your circumstances. All PetRescuers need to remember to keep any lost pets separated from their children and other pets. This helps ensure that everyone is safe, so that your good deed doesn’t end badly.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a collar and I.D. tag on your pet at all times.

Fences should be tall for jumping pets, buried at least 6 inches into the ground for digging pets, and without open cracks or loose boards for pushy pets and tiny pets. Invisible fences or pens work for some dogs, but others barrel right through these barriers, not minding the electric shock if it means they get to chase that squirrel. On outings, use a leash and never leave your dog unsupervised. Many dogs get stolen, injured by the tether or other animals, or even strangle themselves when left alone on a leash. Best if kept inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching a Lost Pet
First things first, it’s really important to remember that lost pets are out of their element, and their behavior is often unpredictable. Be mindful of your approach:
Stay calm place food and a recently worn shirt at last seen location. The 
Walk slowly toward the pet.
If the pet starts growling, back away.
Don’t make any sudden movements, like a quick grab for a collar, or you may provoke the pet into aggressive behavior.
If you can approach the pet without scaring it, try talking to it to give it a little reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not know animal or yours is acting strange or agressive:
Never put yourself at risk when trying to rescue a lost pet. Back away slowly and call animal control for help.
Sick and injured pets are almost always on the defensive, so in those situations, you should call animal control services for help. Even though you want to help, only trained professionals know how to handle these situations in a way that protects the pet and people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your animal comes to you DO NOT DISCIPLINE for running off. Give them treats and love for coming to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to Do With a Lost Pet :
You’re standing toe-to-paw with a lost pet, now what? The first thing you need to do is check for a collar and ID tags and immediately call the number on the tags. Often, a pet will have an owner tag and a vet’s tag. Try to call the owner first, and if she doesn&amp;#39;t answer, try the vet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, many lost pets don’t have collars. Cats generally don’t wear collars and tags, and lost dogs also have a tendency to lose their collars, too. So it’s pretty common to come across a lost pet without a collar and ID tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a few options for what to do with a lost pet with no form of visible ID:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it to a vet clinic or animal shelter to be scanned for a microchip.
If you take the pet to a vet clinic, please be aware that they may not shelter the pet until the owner is located–except maybe in the strange circumstance that it’s one of their patients.
Call a local shelter with animal control services to come and pick up the pet.
Not all shelters have animal control services, so you may have to call more than one.
If a microchip scan positively identifies the pet, then you have to decide whether to keep the pet in your care until the owner arrives or leave it with a shelter. This, of course, is a decision only you can make, and it depends entirely on your circumstances. All PetRescuers need to remember to keep any lost pets separated from their children and other pets. This helps ensure that everyone is safe, so that your good deed doesn’t end badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I was walking my 6 month old Belgian Malinois this morning around a park (a park that specifically requires a leash on your dog), we were stopping every so often so I could reward her for good leash behavior. Everything was going smoothly until we reached a rather populated section with about 20 people, I saw a few dogs but they were all on a leash so I thought nothing of it, that was until a HUGE dog (Cane Corso I believe) ran out of the bushes without a leash or an owner from what I could see. It ran directly at us and I put myself between it and my dog who was already scared and beneath my legs (shes really skittish around unfamiliar dogs), that was when the owner ran up and called the dog over (at least it had good recall). Then the owner started yelling at ME because my dog was on a leash, saying how his dog doesn't like other dogs and especially ones that are on a leash and how I should be more mindful about HIS off-leash dog. I kinda just nodded and walked away because I didn't want to have a screaming match in the middle of a park. On my way home I called the park office and reported the incident and found out that the man does this often (including the screaming at another person), despite multiple fines and court appearances.

&lt;h1&gt;Reminders and Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be respectful to one another.  Say nothing you wouldn&amp;#39;t say to someone coming to you for opinions or advice face-to-face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs, dog training, and dog ownership are not one-size-fits-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog ownership and culture is different around the world.  Be aware of cultural differences when reading or posting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Be aware of the disparity in &amp;quot;common knowledge&amp;quot; between the two groups when reading or posting.  Not everyone has the same knowledge, background, or experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing comments or posts, give some thought to the overall tone.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not downvote someone for being naive, ignorant, uneducated, or having a disagreeable opinion.  When you downvote someone, tell them why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upvote posts you enjoyed and posts you want to see more of. Upvote posts that could use the exposure to get OP more assistance.  Upvote posts that are controversial but have good discussion.  Upvote solid comments. Upvote comments that cite sources. Upvote comments that ELI5. Upvote comments that say something a little different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive reinforcement isn&amp;#39;t just for dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We've had this little guy for only a week.  I know it's still very early for all of us, and our dynamic is still changing almost every day, usually for the better.  We got him from a shelter, the last owner returned him because he ""didn't get along with"" their other dogs. He's 4 months old, mother was a jack russell mix and father unknown. I used a dog identify app on him and got [this](https://imgur.com/DsF2ICy) result. (also see for pic of pup)

We live in an apartment. He's only had 3 pee accidents inside, and finally caught on within the last 2-3 days that he can whine near the door or pounce on it and we will take him out. So, wanting to encourage this, we always respond and immediately take him out to either the yard right outside our building or a small, wooded clearing nearby (with free poop bags and a trash can.)  We try not to do anything else at this time and avoid walks so he doesn't use this tactic to go outside just for fun.  He pees great every time, right outside our building. 

So there were a few days where he pooped off-leash at the small dog park in our apartment community.  (There are very rarely any dogs there.)  This is fine, but it's not super close to our building and we were hoping he would start going in the wooded area nearby.  Sometimes he really has to go, starts acting like a maniac compared to his usual self, and we take him out to that ""ideal"" spot over and over and he refuses to go.  Sometimes he'll just sit down and stare at me like I'm crazy.  I let him sniff around a ton, and nothing.  I stand and wait for him for 15 minutes while being eaten alive by mosquitos; nothing.  He also has some anxiety and leash aggression because of bad experiences before we got him, so being at an apartment community he gets distracted by **everything** around us, constantly.  Trying to take him anywhere he doesn't want to go at this point is difficult and you're basically pulling him along.  When I take him back inside without pooping, he'll usually get the zoomies or act crazy for about a minute then goes to the door to go out again.  Repeat.  He *has* gone in that area about 3 times total, but tonight he is being really stubborn about it.  After about 4 trips and no go, he finally gave up and fell asleep on the couch.  Right now we're not sure if he has to go at all, even though all the signs were there earlier.  We do try to give him enough walks to get things moving, but we're in Raleigh and mid-day he just gets really wiped out by the heat very quickly.

It's just frustrating for us when he goes to the door over and over and we take him out and he doesn't do anything.  Will this eventually ease up over time?  I'm not completely against taking him to the dog park every time if it just gets it out of him and returns him to a non-possessed dog again, but my concern is creating a bad habit if he only ever went poop off-leash.  We took him there but left the leash on and he didn't like that either.  He's also played there with other dogs a few times, so I don't want to encourage whining at the door/potty break cues to mean ""dog park time.""  Is this reasonable, or should we just take him there and let him go?  We are moving to a building even further away in September, so while I'm willing to take him there daily *now* I won't be in 2 months, so I am wondering if I should just avoid that behavior right now.  

Any suggestions or ""stop doings"" are super appreciated.  Any comments about me over thinking are also probably valid and welcome.

Though he was taught tons of tricks, he was never taught to trust people. His history is lengthy and not really why I'm posting. 

When I got him, the rescue pointed me to the vet he went to with his old family. Thinking it was best to go somewhere he knows, I continued to take him to said vet. One small print aspect of Edison is that he has episodes of ""seizures"". I only put quotes because this behavior is very different than how seizures typically manifest. Having two family members and one family dashound with epilepsy, I figured it was a good match. Upon experiencing his episodes, I wonder if these are even seizure related. 

Edison will get really close to me when the episodes start and even leans into my body. He then starts having odd and irregular breathing. The kind of breaths that intake quickly and shakily (almost like several small breaths in rapid succession). His head and chest move with these breaths and you can see his lips sucking in. 

These episodes typically build in severity and slowly die away. This whole endeavor can take the entire night. He will walk around, lay down, relax, and go about his typical routine after the worst of it is over. 

To me, it seems to be  trouble breathing or  blocked air ways? The vet has not been helpful in this issue and many others. I'm searching for a better place, but I aslo don't want to go on a while goose chase for something that really isn't hurting him.

However I ended up being his primary caretaker and when we moved recently I was the only one who could take him. We were not prepared to have a dog at all, but all in all I really love him and things have been going well. Except today my friend who adopted him was walking him and he bit a woman out of the blue. There's maybe some factors here, the woman was jogging and even though my friend kept a distance she didn't hold him under his chin right under his face harness like I do any time anyone passes by. I feel that I know him a lot better and while I never expected him to bite someone he can get excited and want to run at someone or he has growled a few times, so just having a good grip on him is a must for me. We even had someone violent provoke our dog and our dog still didn't bite.

The people we adopted him from didn't get him fixed, and while I lived with the friends it just didn't end up happening. We'd talk about it and then it just didn't happen, and I was traveling a lot at the time. Now that I have him I have looked into it more, I just need to find someone who can drive us because I dont have a car and I am new to the area. I totally recognize how irresponsible we have all been with this. I contacted his previous owners for his vet records today in case the victim needs them. They had told us that his shots were up to date but looking at his records that doesn't seem to be the case at all. In fact it seems that maybe they only took him to the vet once? This is the thing I am also flipping out about. I really dont think he has rabies but still he should have had his shots.

There&amp;#39;s maybe some factors here, the woman was jogging and even though my friend kept a distance she didn&amp;#39;t hold him under his chin right under his face harness like I do any time anyone passes by. I feel that I know him a lot better and while I never expected him to bite someone he can get excited and want to run at someone or he has growled a few times, so just having a good grip on him is a must for me. We even had someone violent provoke our dog and our dog still didn&amp;#39;t bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people we adopted him from didn&amp;#39;t get him fixed, and while I lived with the friends it just didn&amp;#39;t end up happening. We&amp;#39;d talk about it and then it just didn&amp;#39;t happen, and I was traveling a lot at the time. Now that I have him I have looked into it more, I just need to find someone who can drive us because I dont have a car and I am new to the area. I totally recognize how irresponsible we have all been with this. I contacted his previous owners for his vet records today in case the victim needs them. They had told us that his shots were up to date but looking at his records that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the case at all. In fact it seems that maybe they only took him to the vet once? This is the thing I am also flipping out about. I really dont think he has rabies but still he should have had his shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recommended a really good trainer today because I just asked around after this all happened. So I am going to contact them too. I am just really overwhelmed and I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or some advice?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi fellow dog people!

I was looking into fostering kittens (as a lesbian it's what my biological clock is telling me to do rather than having babies), and I noticed that one of the reqs for foster parents is that all pets in the home are UTD on vaccines, which makes sense. A while ago I asked my mom if our dog, who is a 16 lb terrier mix/mutt was UTD on his vaccines. She got quiet, and when I pressed her told me the vet told her that ""his immune system was too fragile"" for vaccines. 

I should note that this vets office is very catered towards a type of owner that wants to feed their dogs only the *Best Organic Gluten-Free Non-GMO Raw Meat Premium Food^TM*. One of the things they offer is homeopathy which is obviously complete bunk, but their hearts are clearly in the right place and they were very good with his 2 teeth extractions and his checkups.

Our dog is between 12 and 16 years old and is very healthy for his age. He had all but 9 teeth removed (they were in bad shape when we got him), and our vet recommended supplementing with broth as he had some kidney crystals. He also sometimes has loud stomach gurgling/bloating + doesn't want to eat breakfast maybe 2-3 times a month. Recently the poor thing had a foxtail go all the way through his paw, but he recovered well/quickly once it was out and it's all healed now. 

6-7 years ago he *did* have a serious illness which may have been from him eating rat poison, but we aren't sure. The vet couldn't tell what exactly was wrong, and his outlook was very bad, w/ internal bleeding. However he recovered fully. I do know he was on steroids for a while afterwards.

Now, I looked through all the immunodeficiency-causing diseases I could find on the internet, and **as far as I can tell**, my dog has none of the symptoms. He is a shelter dog, so unless he's some sort of new mini Glen of Imaal Terrier designer breed, he shouldn't have any genetic issues from inbreeding. He's basically super healthy and happy.

The only type of immune disorder he could have is immunoglobulin (antibody) deficiency, or some other immunodeficiency caused by a virus. However we weren't with our current vet when he got really sick 6-7 years ago. He was also fully vaccinated when we got him.



####**How do I talk to my mom about getting him vaccinated without putting her on the defensive?** Does anyone here have a partially vaccinated dog, or know someone with one? Is it even legal for him to not be UTD on his vaccines?

I was looking at my puppy's eyes and I noticed that the black edge around one of her eyelids was disrupted by some patch.

Our vet is currently closed, so I won't be able to see them until tomorrow, but I'm a bit worried about what it can be.

My late fur baby developed a growth around her eyelid later in life, but nothing ever happened with it. But because of events that happened around her passing, I've been super worried with any health concerns regarding this one, especially after already having a few issues that resulted in several unplanned visits to the vet.

Ex and I dated for 6.5 years. We got two dogs, brother and sister, just a litter apart. I'm the big dog guy, and while she loved them we got them cause of me. The only problem is, both times we got them I was away on work for a few months both times so they bonded more closely with her as puppies. It was is to the point were if I would have them on leash and walk away from her they would get separation anxiety and scream. People would stare. When we broke up she offered to take one of them, but they are very close to each other so I offered her both or none. She chose none.

I am about to move out of the state and probably never come back. Its been nine months since we broke up and since the last time they saw her. I have to go pick up some stuff from her before I leave and will have the dogs with me in the back of my SUV in crates. They wont be able to see her out of the truck unless I let them by opening the rear hatch/taking them out.

I could care less about the Ex seeing them, I know she misses them but thats not the issue here. I care more about the dogs missing her. I know my they miss her and would love to see her. I just want them to be happy, so what would be better.

1. Letting my dogs see her one final time and be happy for 5 minutes
2. Not let them see her ever again

Its really tearing me up. I feel horrible for the dogs because they don't know what happened just that their mom isnt around anymore. When we broke up, I stayed in our apt for a month and she moved to her her dads while I found a place to move in to. Anytime they heard someone at the door they ran to it cause they thought it was her finally coming home. Always brought a tear to my eye.

Posting out of desperation trying to see if anyone else has run into this issue with their dog or can tell me what’s going on. 

My dog:
-5 years old male
-mixed breed (father was Maltese, mother is unknown)
-neutered
-Costco brand dog food 

Medications:
-frontline plus for flea 
-turmeric and curcumin chewable for joint and immune system

History:
This has been going on/off roughly for the past 2-3 years. It happens like clockwork. Every 3 months, he will suddenly scream out in pain, whimper, and roll up like a ball. This lasts for about 5 seconds. Then he starts licking the ground around him constantly and moves in a circle using only his front two legs. He then gets up and stretches in a downward dog position. Begins to pant and looks for a dark place to hide. About 15-30 minutes later, same exact thing. This goes on for a day or two and then he’s completely fine. 3 months later, same exact thing all over again. 

I have taken him to the hospital on four separate occasions (three different vets). Two have said it might be a muscle strain. Prescribed meds but no change. The other said it might be fleas biting. 

Observations:
No guarding when I try and touch any part of his body. Don’t feel anything weird in the abdomen. No deformities in his extremities. No diarrhea/vomiting/bloody stool. Normal eyes. No limping, dragging, exertion. 

Please help!! Just pains me to see him like this. A horrible, vicious cycle. 

Really appreciate it,

&lt;li&gt;How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less than hour on weekdays, over a hour on weekends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m completely fine with a moderate amount of brushing or trimming, and I would definitely be doing most grooming at home. either weekly or several times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) What size dog are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium-large&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moderate or minimal amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moderately, I want something that&amp;#39;s reliable/obedient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dog Personality and Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a balance of both (but if forced to choose, personal space)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a balance of both or eager to please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barking or initially cautious is fine, and then I would want them to respond to me telling them it&amp;#39;s okay. guard dogs welcome but not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation anxiety, destructiveness, excessive barking, hostility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approx 8-9(ish) hours on weekdays as I work full-time, less on weekends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a obedient dog who is well-behaved and non-obtrusive (wont be noisy, destructive, hostile, needy etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, and we do not plan on getting another animal besides the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no, none that im aware of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sydney, Australia, not that im aware of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summer is hot and humid ranging from 20-30 something Celsius, winters can be chilly but shouldn&amp;#39;t be severe enough to jeopardize dogs health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dog will have access to spacious, grassy backyard with a dog house and shelter on a patio. Dog will be allowed in a spacious house in evenings with owner but sleeps outside.   My work arrangements are flexible so I can work from home to help dog settle into its new life initially. I prefer a puppy, not a adult dog.&lt;/li&gt;

Body of a greyhound, fur of a wolfhound, ears of a shepherd. Just to give you an idea on size. She’s now 7 months old.

Same thing in the park the other day. Had both my girls with me. Other dogs and humans set her off big time if they were passing the girls and I. This behaviour has only happened while she was recovering from her desexing and having her dew claws removed. We stayed home for those two weeks while she healed and the week before that as we all had a virus so did light exercise in the backyard. 

It seems she feels the need to protect the kids from other dogs and strangers. 

There is a trainer in our area but I’m not happy with her training methods. I feel they’re a bit aggressive.

I love looking stuff on reddit because the community and variety. The site/commenters are almost always doing so to be helpful and/or enlighten people on subjects the happen to know more about. 

I have a 2 year old male lab dog who I got when he was 8 weeks old. It’s important to note I we live in an apartment so he is an inside dog. He has always been extremely smart and learned a lot of tricks. Ever since I’ve had him he has always slept in bed with me laying against me. I have no complaints and is one of my favorite things about him. He lets me cuddle him if I want but always lays and sleeps on my side. I would guess there has been 7-10 days total in the 2  years that he slept somewhere else. (My moms when he was young and I worked long hours) the problem and point of this entire post however is that late at night if I’m not ready for bed and he is he will let out short whines/cries. He absolutely will not sleep at night with me in the room. (He will take naps on the weekends during the days at the time I’m normally gone at work) 
I have tried putting him in the kennel, a water gun (very recent, so just  a few times) and flicking him in the nose/chest. This is last resort as I don’t believe in physical abuse to teach. I want him to be the dog that doesn’t flinch when others go to pet his head.  Feel free to comment if you think more physical could help but it will be hard to convince me. When he was a puppy and stayed with my mom he was bad about jumping on people, always a loving way but no sense of boundaries so my mom got him a shock collar. I did not like this but that was her rule after awhile. She never turned it past vibrate and while it did work to a degree, he was a different dog with it on. He was obviously scared, nervous, and opposite of his happy go lucky self. So my fellow Reddit fam, please send suggestions on how to get him to quit whining late at night when he’s ready for sleep and I’m not. If any questions feel free to ask, I’ll check, however I’m not sure if I will get updates on replies or just need to manually look on here. Also final thing, the  easy thing is to say put him in kennel. While I know I shouldn’t give in, this normally happens late at night so the whining is magnified. If I have friends over and put him in the room while we all hang out in the front, he will whine. I know stay strong but as someone who has roommates and lives in apartment it is easier said then done because I break after awhile due to fear of waking others up. All suggestions welcome, if this is his worst trait I can live with it because he is the happiest dog I’ve ever known and is all love with a pure soul. Kind of like how they say babies are born pure and all love. Had to put that in there for my first post. Based on how this go will determine if I have a second.

She was very shy and anxious when we first adopted her. But with each day you could tell she was becoming more comfortable. The entire time we've had her she's been a great dog. I mean really a great dog. It seems couldn't have gotten luckier.

We have completed 20 weeks of obedience training, which she did really well. 

A month ago my wife and I went on a two-week trip. Our dog was staying half of the time with my parents and half of the time with my in-laws. 

When we returned from our trip it's like something changed in her. All of a sudden she's a barker when she wasn't before. She barks and snorts when she sees other dogs, which she didn't before. I don't believe it's aggression because she plays well with dogs, cats, kids, and adults. I have to assume it's excitement and frustration when she can't play with them. She pulls a bit on the leash to get to other dogs. She sounds vicious. People look at her breed and assume the worst.  

The only thing I can think of is that my parents have a pomeranian who isn't trained and it barks ALL OF THE TIME. I don't know if maybe while our dog was with my parents she learned from my parent's dog that barking gets her things. 

It's far from the worst problem to have but it is a behavior we'd like to change.

* I live alone, in a house with a chain link fenced in backyard
* I have a 9 year old male calico cat named Bob
* I have a 4 year old female golden retriever named Rapunzel
* I work about 10 hours a day
* I have depression, which can often get in the way of things (or make me have constant negative thoughts as I am right now)

&amp;#x200B;

Rapunzel is a good girl who enjoys walks and playing with some other dogs, but mostly enjoys lounging around in the backyard. We would occasionally go hiking on the weekends, baring any work work that comes up. For all intents and purposes, I feel like Rapunzel is the perfect dog for me.

I've thought about getting a second dog, thinking that Rapunzel would have a playmate and they could keep each other happy while I was either at work, or at home doing work/chores.

&amp;#x200B;

**The prelude**

A bit over a month ago, I saw a post from a rescue group about a female husky mix (named Leena). She looked very pretty, and she was about 9 months old (about 11 months now), so I made an impulse decision to go for it. I put in the application, and the foster wanted to do a meet and greet a few days later.

The meet and greet at my house went great! The dogs seemed to follow each other around the house, and played for about a half hour in the backyard. This play was mostly chasing each other, not a long of physical contact.

The foster seemed to be impressed by my dog and house, and I was the best of the few candidates that applied so far, and that a decision would be made within a few days. A few days later, I was told that I was the best choice and that Leena would be mine. **I was happy to hear this, but looking back, I don't think I was ecstatic about this (telling friends, etc.).**

&amp;#x200B;

**The beginning**

Fast forward to the next weekend, Leena was dropped off at my house, and I signed the paperwork for the foster/rescue. The dogs were seemingly happy as before. Once the foster left, I let the two dogs into the backyard to play for a while while I sat out there with them.

The playing was immediately a lot rougher. There was a lot of physical contact, mouthing, play attacking. This seemed okay to me, since both Rapunzel and Leena were initiating and the seemed to be having fun, which is what I wanted.

There were many toys in the backyard for them to play with, Leena would pick one up and run around with it while Rapunzel would chase after Leena, trying to get it, and this would eventually translate to more play fighting.

I walked the two dogs at the same time, to be as efficient as I could with limited time. Leena would constantly pull on the leash, Rapunzel would walk with a loose leash. I figured this was normal for Leena, as she was excited to see everything around her.

&amp;#x200B;

The daily routine is:

* Get up
* 1 hour walk
* Get ready for the day
* Feed the dogs and cat
* Put Leena in a crate for the day (will explain more below)
* Go to work
* Come home, let the dogs out in the backyard for a half hour or so
* Go for an hour walk
* Dinner for me, dogs, cat
* Training with dogs (some separate, some together)
* Relaxing / playing
* 30 minute walk
* Leena in a crate to go to bed
* Sleep

&amp;#x200B;

**The complications**

1. Leena had a pretty bad separation anxiety for a while. The first few business days after getting her, I stayed home and tried to gradually work on her crating. **The foster said Leena was great in crates and would voluntarily hang out in there and be okay at night and during the day (while the foster was gone/sleeping).** I initially considered the separation anxiety as a response to a new environment / routine, and Leena has improved in that area a good deal over the last few weeks. However, she can still be a bit destructive if I leave her out of the crate while I work around the house (outside) or make a quick trip to get food.
2. Since I've gotten Leena, she has taken over a lot of Rapunzel's favorite things to do. Running back and forth the fence when the neighbor's dog comes out for a walk, some of her favorite toys, favorite spots to lay down inside and outside, constantly getting in her way during walks, and so on. **This has caused Rapunzel to be sad (or at least pushed out), and she has stopped trying to do those things.**
3. The playing has very recently (last few days) gotten more aggressive. Leena will now attempt to go for Rapunzel's hind legs or tail, if she ""latches on"" (it doesn't seem to be a hard bite), she will start to thrash her head around. I am usually quick to respond to this and break it up, **but there are times when I don't notice right away, and this causes Rapunzel to want to run away.**
4. Other times, Rapunzel wants to play, and they will be play fighting normally (mouthing but nothing too rough). However, when Rapunzel gets tired or bored, she wants to lay down and look around. **Leena may still want to play, and will walk/run over to Rapunzel and start to tackle her / go for the neck or legs.**
5. Also this past week, Leena has begun to start play attacking Rapunzel on our walks. This makes it difficult to break them up, and often takes time to get them to calm down. I have been separating the walks (walking individually), and Leena will generally be okay but may sometimes want to jump up on me and be rough.

&amp;#x200B;

**The realizations**

**I'm not sure I feel a connection with Leena. She can be fun to be around at times, but a lot of the time I have been having negative thoughts about her, and am questioning if I really want to have her as a pet/companion. To me, it just feels as if Leena is just is task or a chore that needs to be taken care of, and not a lot beyond that.**

I'm sure a great deal of this is the overwhelming aspect of having a second (and much younger) dog in my life, and having to adjust to that. It has been a lot more than I had to deal with with Rapunzel, but it's nothing too crazy (e.g. every second I need to attend to them).

Since I've gotten Leena, I think I've been thinking even more about Rapunzel, because she's been unable or unwilling to do her favorite things. I want Rapunzel to be happy, but if Leena is butting into her things, she doesn't get that chance.

This may be my depression speaking, but it was so much easier when it was just Rapunzel, Bob, and I. I had more freedom to go out  and do things because the two were okay with my being gone for a while (and at any time). With Leena, I haven't been able to do a lot of those things. Maybe that's because of me, maybe that's because of her (being about 11 months old now).

&amp;#x200B;

**The question**

**Am I a bad owner for thinking about / wanting to give up Leena (back to the foster/rescue)?**

As I put in the realizations, I don't feel like I love Leena or have a connection with her. I want Leena to live a great life, and I am not sure if I am capable of doing that. Again, this may just be me being lazy or not wanting to work harder, but I just don't know if I can give her that great life.

I am concerned that the aggressiveness/dominance of Leena going after Rapunzel means they aren't a good fit for each other, especially since Rapunzel has been trying to get away (not wanting to play or being scared).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick background before I get into the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live alone, in a house with a chain link fenced in backyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a 9 year old male calico cat named Bob&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a 4 year old female golden retriever named Rapunzel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work about 10 hours a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have depression, which can often get in the way of things (or make me have constant negative thoughts as I am right now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapunzel is a good girl who enjoys walks and playing with some other dogs, but mostly enjoys lounging around in the backyard. We would occasionally go hiking on the weekends, baring any work work that comes up. For all intents and purposes, I feel like Rapunzel is the perfect dog for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought about getting a second dog, thinking that Rapunzel would have a playmate and they could keep each other happy while I was either at work, or at home doing work/chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prelude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit over a month ago, I saw a post from a rescue group about a female husky mix (named Leena). She looked very pretty, and she was about 9 months old (about 11 months now), so I made an impulse decision to go for it. I put in the application, and the foster wanted to do a meet and greet a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meet and greet at my house went great! The dogs seemed to follow each other around the house, and played for about a half hour in the backyard. This play was mostly chasing each other, not a long of physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foster seemed to be impressed by my dog and house, and I was the best of the few candidates that applied so far, and that a decision would be made within a few days. A few days later, I was told that I was the best choice and that Leena would be mine. &lt;strong&gt;I was happy to hear this, but looking back, I don&amp;#39;t think I was ecstatic about this (telling friends, etc.).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the next weekend, Leena was dropped off at my house, and I signed the paperwork for the foster/rescue. The dogs were seemingly happy as before. Once the foster left, I let the two dogs into the backyard to play for a while while I sat out there with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playing was immediately a lot rougher. There was a lot of physical contact, mouthing, play attacking. This seemed okay to me, since both Rapunzel and Leena were initiating and the seemed to be having fun, which is what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many toys in the backyard for them to play with, Leena would pick one up and run around with it while Rapunzel would chase after Leena, trying to get it, and this would eventually translate to more play fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked the two dogs at the same time, to be as efficient as I could with limited time. Leena would constantly pull on the leash, Rapunzel would walk with a loose leash. I figured this was normal for Leena, as she was excited to see everything around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily routine is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 hour walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ready for the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed the dogs and cat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put Leena in a crate for the day (will explain more below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come home, let the dogs out in the backyard for a half hour or so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for an hour walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dinner for me, dogs, cat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training with dogs (some separate, some together)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relaxing / playing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 minute walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leena in a crate to go to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leena had a pretty bad separation anxiety for a while. The first few business days after getting her, I stayed home and tried to gradually work on her crating. &lt;strong&gt;The foster said Leena was great in crates and would voluntarily hang out in there and be okay at night and during the day (while the foster was gone/sleeping).&lt;/strong&gt; I initially considered the separation anxiety as a response to a new environment / routine, and Leena has improved in that area a good deal over the last few weeks. However, she can still be a bit destructive if I leave her out of the crate while I work around the house (outside) or make a quick trip to get food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve gotten Leena, she has taken over a lot of Rapunzel&amp;#39;s favorite things to do. Running back and forth the fence when the neighbor&amp;#39;s dog comes out for a walk, some of her favorite toys, favorite spots to lay down inside and outside, constantly getting in her way during walks, and so on. &lt;strong&gt;This has caused Rapunzel to be sad (or at least pushed out), and she has stopped trying to do those things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The playing has very recently (last few days) gotten more aggressive. Leena will now attempt to go for Rapunzel&amp;#39;s hind legs or tail, if she &amp;quot;latches on&amp;quot; (it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a hard bite), she will start to thrash her head around. I am usually quick to respond to this and break it up, &lt;strong&gt;but there are times when I don&amp;#39;t notice right away, and this causes Rapunzel to want to run away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other times, Rapunzel wants to play, and they will be play fighting normally (mouthing but nothing too rough). However, when Rapunzel gets tired or bored, she wants to lay down and look around. &lt;strong&gt;Leena may still want to play, and will walk/run over to Rapunzel and start to tackle her / go for the neck or legs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also this past week, Leena has begun to start play attacking Rapunzel on our walks. This makes it difficult to break them up, and often takes time to get them to calm down. I have been separating the walks (walking individually), and Leena will generally be okay but may sometimes want to jump up on me and be rough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The realizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure I feel a connection with Leena. She can be fun to be around at times, but a lot of the time I have been having negative thoughts about her, and am questioning if I really want to have her as a pet/companion. To me, it just feels as if Leena is just is task or a chore that needs to be taken care of, and not a lot beyond that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure a great deal of this is the overwhelming aspect of having a second (and much younger) dog in my life, and having to adjust to that. It has been a lot more than I had to deal with with Rapunzel, but it&amp;#39;s nothing too crazy (e.g. every second I need to attend to them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve gotten Leena, I think I&amp;#39;ve been thinking even more about Rapunzel, because she&amp;#39;s been unable or unwilling to do her favorite things. I want Rapunzel to be happy, but if Leena is butting into her things, she doesn&amp;#39;t get that chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be my depression speaking, but it was so much easier when it was just Rapunzel, Bob, and I. I had more freedom to go out  and do things because the two were okay with my being gone for a while (and at any time). With Leena, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to do a lot of those things. Maybe that&amp;#39;s because of me, maybe that&amp;#39;s because of her (being about 11 months old now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I a bad owner for thinking about / wanting to give up Leena (back to the foster/rescue)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I put in the realizations, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I love Leena or have a connection with her. I want Leena to live a great life, and I am not sure if I am capable of doing that.

We were the only ones there. 5 minutes later a car rolls up. A man and a woman step out with what I would learn is a Chow-Husky mix. I'll call him, Chomps. 

When they enter the dog park I said hello to the owners. Instantly my dog and Chomps started running and playing. I had just finished a 12 hour work day and was sitting on the bench. The man was trying to get Chomps to play by continuously, loudly, clapping his hands and running around. Weird, but whatever.

Meanwhile, my dog found a spot to poop. I walked over to clean up after her. I was getting the bag out when Chomps runs over and jumps up at me/the bag. Weird, but I brushed it off. The owner saw and apologized. They said they thought it was the bag.

I threw the bag away and start walking toward the bench when Chomps runs by and grabs my arm. 

""I'm so sorry! He hasn't done this in so long."" I'm a little annoyed but, okay. 

I decided to get up and run with my dog a little. Before I took two steps Chomps runs by and grabs my hand. Keep in mind, these aren't hard bites. They are just enough to hurt and leave little welts that went away in a few hours. It was like Jaws. You didn't even see him coming. He'd jump up from the depths and grab your arms/hands.

Another couple shows up with their two dogs. Within a few minutes of arriving, Chomps grabs her arm. Again the owners apologize. 

I came to learn that Chomps was 2 years old. He was adopted via a Craigslist ad. When the owner went to see him they had two large cages, one with a husky and the other with a chow. When they showed the owner Chomps, they pulled him out of the crate with other dogs where he had to fight for food. They said he was a girl. Nope, he was a boy. When the owner said they would pay $X.XX for him, the seller said they would have to ""clear it with the handler,"" and made a phone call. Chomps was 7 weeks old when he was adopted. 

Chomps has severe food aggression and intermittent dog aggression. 

In total, Chomps chomped me 6 times and the other woman once. I had told them to get Chomps under control. All they did was apologize. 

He started to go after my dogs back legs and tail which pissed my dog off. I removed my dog from the park before my dog decided to stand up for herself and hurt Chomps. 

Needless to say, Chomps should have been taken out after he chomped me the second time, without the bag. Arguably, knowing Chomps history, he shouldn't have been in the dog park to begin with. 

What is the appropriate action to take against a dog like this?

The carpet scratching is awful and he literally keeps at it in the same spot until you physically move him. Although he is old he is in very good physical condition, and aside from these weird nighttime behaviors, he seems to be doing well mentally as well.

I've gotten him higher rise beds so he can see me at night but that didn't help; I even got him a little stuffed animal with a heartbeat that worked for like two days. Aside from that I'm at a complete loss and I'm getting desperate. It's unbelievable how long he keeps it up without wearing himself out.

It is always much worse when my boyfriend sleeps over, so now my bf doesn't like to sleep over because he can't actually sleep. Since I have a dog and live alone I can't sleepover at my bf's either.

I’ll start off by saying I’m willing and ready to take her to the vet, I just want some more opinions on whether I should observe a little longer before doing so. 

Relevant details:

She is in heat. I know this affects digestion and is why I think maybe I’m being a little overly concerned.

She also just got all of her puppy boosters the day before yesterday. I’m not sure if that can upset her stomach.

It’s been happening on and off that her stools will be runny or hard, and she looks like she’s struggling. It seems to regulate again pretty quickly.

She hasn’t had any trouble with eating until last night (last night I spoon-fed her dinner)

She poops every time she eats, with only a couple exceptions that have only been when her schedule is thrown off.

I feed her high quality dry food mixed with wet food and I add some pumpkin to help things along (a little under 2 tablespoons- she’s a big girl- it really seems to help) Her diet hasn’t changed.

As far as I know, she hasn’t eaten anything unusual aside from some leaves off an unidentified bush in the back yard.

Last night after dinner, she pooped twice and it was runny. She had an accident in the house before dawn this morning (again runny) and she also threw up. I’ve had her about five weeks, and this is the first accident she’s had since one on her first day here.

This morning I’ve barely been able to get her to eat anything. She’s had some, but only with a lot of coercion. She pooped again once this morning. Still runny. 

She’s 65lbs and about a year old. She still seems happy and wants to play, though she’s a little more low-key today than usual.

I’ve stayed home from work to monitor her for the day with the thought that if it wasn’t better by morning, I’d take her to the vet (her vet is open until noon on Saturdays).

I have a (soon to be) 4 year old female Canaan named Kairi. She's very aloof to strangers(people) but an extremely friendly dog to those she knows very well. She's a lot better dealing with dogs that she doesn't know, especially off leash. She hasn't shown any signs of aggression in the context of wanting to hurt any dogs, and any type of resource guarding has been trained out of her. She has never went after another dog in a vicious way. 

She's a pretty chill dog and is very forgiving to dogs that she doesn't know, including young and smaller dogs, as it takes a bit to get her worked up.  The one thing that she is, though, is aggressive in her play. With her best friend, she is very rough in her play with the vocal growls and the play bow, with body slamming/hip checking, and her friend has learned to play rough back to her. 

What Kairi will do, and I have found it mostly with other females (like her friend), is that she gets in a play bow, and the other dog won't answer, or they do but she will jump at them and push them down very hard.

Kairi seems to do this the younger dogs. But once these younger dogs start pushing back at her and bringing the play to her, she relaxes. I have also found, the more ""confident"" or dominant dogs, she is much easy going with and won't go as hard but she still is rough with her play no matter.

&lt;p&gt;I have a (soon to be) 4 year old female Canaan named Kairi. She&amp;#39;s very aloof to strangers(people) but an extremely friendly dog to those she knows very well. She&amp;#39;s a lot better dealing with dogs that she doesn&amp;#39;t know, especially off leash. She hasn&amp;#39;t shown any signs of aggression in the context of wanting to hurt any dogs, and any type of resource guarding has been trained out of her. She has never went after another dog in a vicious way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a pretty chill dog and is very forgiving to dogs that she doesn&amp;#39;t know, including young and smaller dogs, as it takes a bit to get her worked up.  The one thing that she is, though, is aggressive in her play. With her best friend, she is very rough in her play with the vocal growls and the play bow, with body slamming/hip checking, and her friend has learned to play rough back to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Kairi will do, and I have found it mostly with other females (like her friend), is that she gets in a play bow, and the other dog won&amp;#39;t answer, or they do but she will jump at them and push them down very hard. A lot of the times, the dog is instantly submissive and Kairi will push again, and then will calm down and sniff the other dog and won&amp;#39;t push it further if the dog remains submissive. &lt;/p&gt;

I write this today not for sympathy, but more so awareness and advice. This is the story of Chance, a 7 week golden retriever puppy that my girlfriend and I picked up last Saturday morning. When I say I’ve never met a more sweet, innocent little guy I mean it. We had been waiting for Chance for nearly 6 months, had his name picked out for even longer. 

The first couple days he was a normal pup. Wagging his tail, playing with his brand new toys and eating as much food as he could. We introduced him to our other pup, Myah, a 1 year old Husky and she teased him like any big sister would, but fell in love with him immediately. 

Monday comes around, and Chance hasn’t eaten anything halfway through the day, and only took a few sips of water. Growing up with 6 dogs throughout my lifetime I figured it was just a case of leaving his brothers and sisters and getting sad. So I didn’t think much of it and moved onto Tuesday. Throughout most of the day, he still wasn’t eating and drinking. Throughout the day he started vomiting and having diarrhea. I called our vet, ran him out there but it was too late in the day to get him seen so we had to take him to the nearest emergency vet. While there, the vets ran blood work and did some other tests and diagnosed him with Gastroenteritis. My biggest fear was that he would test positive with Parvo, which would be a whole other story. 

The whole next day Chance hungout at our regular vet and was sent home with some medication include Probiotics, a pill to help his vomiting and diarrhea, as well as an appetite enabler. Let me tell you, this little pup is a fighter. It took me forever to get those pills in him without him spitting them out. Stubborn little guy. 

As we continue to monitor him throughout the night, much is the same. Barely any appetite and small amounts of water. Then came something i never expected..

Later in the day the following day, Chances stomach started to bloat. It’s an understatement when I say it was like a balloon being inflated. Once again, we rushed him down to the hospital. What follows is the worst news I could have heard.. Chance has sever kidney problems and was given a 10% chance to live through the night. Our little man was going to leave us after not even a week of being home. 

After consulting with the vet of what could have happened, she gave us three options before he went in for tests. 1. He was born with a kidney disease 2. He was exposed to a toxin that took over his system or 3. He had Addison’s disease. 

My heart was broken. I didn’t know what to do or think. How could this happen? Such an innocent little guy not deserving anything that’s happening to him. My girlfriend and I talked, and decided he’s fought this hard so far, we can’t give up on him. We go to the Dr and ask about treatment options. To our surprise, and more so disappointment, she recommended uthinization. Simply because she wasn’t 100% sure what caused his kidney problems, but said there’s definitely some severe there and that he more than likely wouldn’t make it through the night to get to a specialist near by. Based off of the emergency vets tests, she completely ruled out Addison’s disease, even though their tech wasn’t capable of knowing whether or not he had it and gave us the other two options, which is where she gave the 10% chance to live. We asked for a second opinion because it didn’t make sense that they could come to that conclusion without clear results. 

The Dr recommends a specialist near by, but said the chances of him making it through the night simply just being hooked up to an IV weren’t high at all. Sitting up all night, no sleep and anxiously awaiting that phone call... I never got one. Chance made it through the night. Before we took him, signing the release papers, the vet asked again, if we want to move forward with this and we agreed to completely. 

Balling our eyes out in what seemed like the longest 20 minute drive of my life, praying he wouldn’t leave us in our arms, we made it to the vet this morning. After the initial screenings, we went over what the last couple of days consisted of with our baby boy and how hard he’s fought. The Dr. analyzed and gave the same three outcomes. The more severe being a birth defect, in which our only option would be to say goodbye, and the better of the 3 being Addison’s or a toxin, being as those can be treated to a degree. 

After leaving our little boy there for today, as I type this we await the results. About a hour ago, the Dr called and gave us the best news of the week, that baby Chance wasn’t born with a defect, but actually had slightly larger Kidneys that normal, which is much better then shrunken kidneys. The second I got that phone call my heart dropped awaiting what the response was going to be. We won’t know until tomorrow what’s fully going on with him, all we know is we’re so proud of him for fighting as hard as he is and trusting us to not give up on him so soon. 

I will provide updates as time goes on, but I just wanted to advise to always get a 2nd opinion, even if you’ve been seeing the same vet for 15 years like I have. It could save your animals life. Maybe that’s why we named him Chance so long ago, because that’s all he needed.

I did my research and wrote a report on chihuahuas, presenting them with the facts and why this was absolutely the dog for me. Writing a report always worked when I wanted to talk them into something, so not long after, I was riding with my dad four hours away to pick up a puppy I had found in the city paper. It took us forever to get there, we got lost more than once, but eventually we arrived and I picked her out of a cardboard box in some strangers kitchen. What I didn't realize as an early teen was... The dog picks the person, the person doesn't pick the dog. Sure, she loved me, but within the month she was following my dad to bed every night. She only gave me the time of day when he wasn't around! She passed a few years ago, at twenty years old, a big grump of a girl. Everyone that knew her had a fond memory of her, even if that memory was of her being a brat. I miss her and I know my dad does too, more than anyone.

The first dog that was truly, solely my dog, came somewhere in the middle of all of that. I live in a rural area so, when a chihuahua appeared out of nowhere one day, we knew it had likely been let out purposely. He was five pounds and terrified. Everyone tried to catch him. We tried food. We tried sitting in the yard, being patient, and letting him warm up to us over time. Weeks passed and nothing was working. Then one day, as my brother sat out on the porch, someone fired a gun. That's not so uncommon around here, people shoot targets for fun. Something snapped in this little guy though because, as my brother opened the door to come back inside, he dashed with all his five pound might and darted into the house before the door was shut. I guess he figured whatever was in there had to be better than whatever was currently happening out there! We bathed him, picked the prickles out of his fur, and tucked him into bed with me. He stayed with me for twelve years. He was a nervous guy who didn't like a lot of things, including people coming near his room, silverware, and thunderstorms. He loved peanut butter with all his heart. The day he was put to sleep I took him outside one last time, carrying him and letting him sniff the air and feel the sun on his face. Once he was gone, I missed him so much that I swore I'd never get another dog. I missed our routine together, I missed his warm little body in bed, I missed his smell. I lasted through three months of loneliness before I broke because of a picture on Facebook.

I didn't know his breed (turned out, dachshund/chihuahua), just that he was tiny and needed help. He was pretty sick when I got him, and I think too young to have been separated from his mother, but a couple of months and a couple of vet visits later, he settled in. It still took me a while to warm up to him. I don't know how common that is, I just missed my old dog. I sometimes wished I could trade back. I can gladly say now, almost a year after first getting him, that feeling is gone. He's insane. He's nothing like my old dog! And I love him for all the ways that he's different. I still miss my little guy but I understand, they're different souls. I think I always understood that, even in my grief. He loves to shower with me, he doesn't care that much for peanut butter but he loves apples, and he gives so many kisses. 

I'm writing this today because I received a package including a new toy for him and he went insane for it, as he does with every new toy. It made me think about things. My little guy would have hated him (way too much noise and energy) but -if dogs can- I think he would have been happy to know that another little guy didn't end up dumped on the side of the road like he was, terrified and alone. That another little guy ended up with his momma instead.

Writing a report always worked when I wanted to talk them into something, so not long after, I was riding with my dad four hours away to pick up a puppy I had found in the city paper. It took us forever to get there, we got lost more than once, but eventually we arrived and I picked her out of a cardboard box in some strangers kitchen. What I didn&amp;#39;t realize as an early teen was... The dog picks the person, the person doesn&amp;#39;t pick the dog. Sure, she loved me, but within the month she was following my dad to bed every night. She only gave me the time of day when he wasn&amp;#39;t around! She passed a few years ago, at twenty years old, a big grump of a girl. Everyone that knew her had a fond memory of her, even if that memory was of her being a brat. I miss her and I know my dad does too, more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dog that was truly, solely my dog, came somewhere in the middle of all of that. I live in a rural area so, when a chihuahua appeared out of nowhere one day, we knew it had likely been let out purposely. He was five pounds and terrified. Everyone tried to catch him. We tried food. We tried sitting in the yard, being patient, and letting him warm up to us over time. Weeks passed and nothing was working. Then one day, as my brother sat out on the porch, someone fired a gun. That&amp;#39;s not so uncommon around here, people shoot targets for fun. Something snapped in this little guy though because, as my brother opened the door to come back inside, he dashed with all his five pound might and darted into the house before the door was shut. I guess he figured whatever was in there had to be better than whatever was currently happening out there! We bathed him, picked the prickles out of his fur, and tucked him into bed with me. He stayed with me for twelve years. He was a nervous guy who didn&amp;#39;t like a lot of things, including people coming near his room, silverware, and thunderstorms. He loved peanut butter with all his heart. The day he was put to sleep I took him outside one last time, carrying him and letting him sniff the air and feel the sun on his face. Once he was gone, I missed him so much that I swore I&amp;#39;d never get another dog. I missed our routine together, I missed his warm little body in bed, I missed his smell. I lasted through three months of loneliness before I broke because of a picture on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know his breed (turned out, dachshund/chihuahua), just that he was tiny and needed help. He was pretty sick when I got him, and I think too young to have been separated from his mother, but a couple of months and a couple of vet visits later, he settled in. It still took me a while to warm up to him. I don&amp;#39;t know how common that is, I just missed my old dog. I sometimes wished I could trade back. I can gladly say now, almost a year after first getting him, that feeling is gone. He&amp;#39;s insane. He&amp;#39;s nothing like my old dog! And I love him for all the ways that he&amp;#39;s different. I still miss my little guy but I understand, they&amp;#39;re different souls. I think I always understood that, even in my grief. He loves to shower with me, he doesn&amp;#39;t care that much for peanut butter but he loves apples, and he gives so many kisses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this today because I received a package including a new toy for him and he went insane for it, as he does with every new toy. It made me think about things. My little guy would have hated him (way too much noise and energy) but -if dogs can- I think he would have been happy to know that another little guy didn&amp;#39;t end up dumped on the side of the road like he was, terrified and alone. That another little guy ended up with his momma instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss you, bud, but me and the kid are doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes - I grew up with dogs but have never been the primary caretaker or lived with one as an adult. My family had GSDs and other herding/guard breeds (Sheltie, BC) growing up. My parents currently have a GSD &amp; a GSD/Malamute mix - I am comfortable w/ large dogs. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Would prefer to rescue. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog loves to snuggle and sticks to me or my partner when we're home and prefers to be in the same room as us. I love running and super long walks (5+ miles) so ideally our dog would have good stamina and energy. We also have other pets (cats, a rabbit) so a low prey drive or high pet friendliness is important. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* None in particular...I think pretty much all dogs are cute! My partner is pretty interested in poodles but there are not many poodles or poodle mixes in shelters/rescues near us. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Ideally I'd like my dog to be a running partner. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* This sounds super fun, but I've never done anything like this. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* My partner works from home and will be able to take the dog out for bathroom breaks during the day - in terms of play, grooming and exercise, between 4-6 hours per day of awake/active interaction time from me. Maybe more from my partner. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* No dog park - we can exercise the dog as much as needed. I'd probably plan for two 1-hour walks per day and ramp up from there. I currently go for walks or runs of that duration daily anyway, so it will be much more fun with a dog. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm not a huge fan of big grooming - I'd prefer to do this for a max of 15-20 minutes a day. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to giant 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding...no problem. We have to vacuum daily anyway. Would prefer low slobber and only alert barks. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important at all. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* As snuggly as possible! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* With a wagging tail! We would prefer the dog to be very friendly to all guests and neighbors. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Child fear - we have small nieces/nephews and need a dog that is friendly towards kids ideally

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not super often...max of 4 hours at a time

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner prefers short-haired or dogs with hair, like the Portuguese Water Dogs, standard Poodles, etc. while I like fluffier dogs like Border Collies and rough Collies a lot. I'll be in charge of the grooming/hair management so the burden of a heavy shedder falls on me anyway. He will walk the dog, feed the dog and also participates in vet appointments. The feeding and walking are shared responsibilities. We will both train the dog. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, cats and a rabbit. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA (MA) - I don't think so

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer - mid 80s - Winder - mid 10s (Farenheit) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I own my home and have a large yard available for the dog. The cats have lived with dogs before and are not dog averse/scared.

I just need you to find me a solution, or explain an existing one because I am a dog virgin (never touched one before even, coincidentally)

1- I want a level 1 dog, not lazy but he MUST be not hyper-active.

2- I am concerned about the diseases that dogs transfer to humans but I have no idea what are they, how frequent they do and if I should be concerned for real.

3- My country is too hot, it reaches up to 52 in summer and it is very humid and dusty, what type of dog would withstand all that? This means also that I can't let him live outside, and I would have to build him a place inside and turn on the AC all the time, which is a huge cost.

4- does a dog significantly scratch stuff and flip stuff and make chaos? (particularly furniture, particularly sofas)

5- Easiest dogs to train on potty and other stuff generally.

6- I would like the closest shape to wolves, but I could see other options so feel free to recommend

7- How much time and effort would I spend to keep the dog clean.

8- how frequent I have to take it to the vet?

9- Can I stop the dog from licking me and kissing me? I hate that, I would only accept it to jump around me and hug me.

10- Fleas?

11- I want a dog who would not annoy other people on street.

12- Also he/she has to not bark all day and night without a reason and annoy my neighbors.

13- How to arrange their sleeping patterns for them not to disturb mine.

&lt;p&gt;6- I would like the closest shape to wolves, but I could see other options so feel free to recommend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7- How much time and effort would I spend to keep the dog clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8- how frequent I have to take it to the vet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9- Can I stop the dog from licking me and kissing me? I hate that, I would only accept it to jump around me and hug me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10- Fleas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11- I want a dog who would not annoy other people on street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12- Also he/she has to not bark all day and night without a reason and annoy my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13- How to arrange their sleeping patterns for them not to disturb mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the way, I live alone!&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway in case I wind up having to answer personal questions. 

So, for some reason my usually chill dog absolutely hates my office, to the point that she constantly harasses me, and I cannot get any work done. I'm wondering if anyone has any insights on what might be bothering her, and what I can do to make her more comfortable.

Here's some details:

She is normally completely chill in working environments. If I work from home, she happily snoozes on the couch more or less all day while I work. If I work in the common area of the office building, she will happily plop in a chair and snooze all day while I work.

But in MY office, she is a wreck. She absolutely cannot settle. She will almost immediately start making an ""awoo"" and pawing at me and jumping on me until we leave the office. 

My office \*should\* be very comfortable for her. It is very spacious. It has a comfy chair that she is welcome to sit in very similar to the chairs she likes in the common area. There's a big plush shag rug to lay on, which she usually \*loves.\* She even has access to a yard through a doggy door out the back. 

I just can't figure it out. Anyone have any insight? Something about MY office bugs her out.

I can't say for sure when it started because she eats less during the summer. At first I thought it was a reaction to the neighborhood fireworks (which go on at least a week before and after Independence Day.) My grandfather died last week, so I've been a bit in my own head.

I've been trying the last few days to entice her with different dry stuff, dry food softened with broth, softened food mixed with canned, straight canned, and canned mixed with rice. It seemed to work at first, but now she's barely taking a few bites. She still seems interested in treats and polished off the last bit of my carne asada burrito last night.

I'm not working at present. I'm looking, but now that she's sick, I'm afraid to leave her alone. I know that the easy answer would be to take her to the vet, but I'll barely make rent this month, as is. I'm new to this area and don't have a local vet here in Oakland.

I'm losing my dog and I don't know what to do. She doesn't seem to be in pain, just sleeping a lot. I'll keep trying to entice her with food when she gets up to go out - she's still drinking water, just barely any food at all.

My second foster we've actually been thinking about adopting. She's great, loves kids and hikes. However, her first two weeks here I had to repeatedly deal with her having diarrhea and the rescue DIY methods of treating it. No vet visits.

Now I was told when we recieved her that she had a fully treated skin condition. I was not told what it was at the time, and only just found out it was mange.

She currently has patches of scaley skin with hair loss that looks like ringworm to me. I assumed before that these were the treated skin condition, however they aren't getting better. I was busy with the diarrhea before and didn't realize they weren't improving.

My son had a scab on his forehead, I assumed was from a scratch. However yesterday and today the scab part fell off and revealed a light coloured mark with a dark pink edge. I was filled with dread as I had dealt with ringworm on my older children last year from my mother's cat.

I'm bringing my son to the doctors today for confirmation and treatment, but the rescue is adament that the dog (who they have not seen in two weeks) does not have ringworm, and it's mange. That is treated.

I love dogs. I want my own badly. But I'm thinking that I may not go through a rescue at this point. They get so many dogs (30ish a week) and there's only two people in charge. I doubt they can keep up with every dog and it's not good for these dogs. They import from out of country, and don't often know the full history and have to rely on what other shelters say about these dogs.

I find it adorable and hilarious but I’ve never seen anything like it before, my GSD doesn’t like blankets and a family friend of ours has 4 dogs and has never heard of it (all Velcro breeds btw, 2 BC’s, an Aussie, and a Dutch Shepherd). Has anyone here heard of such a thing before or is Cana just a quirky weirdo? I’m fine with either but if it’s a behavior I need to stop for some reason let me know because I have no experience in something like this!&lt;/p&gt;

The shelter provides a free checkup with a local vet after you adopt the dog and also 30 days free (somewhat limited) accident and illness insurance (which can be extended at your option by buying a plan and becomes much more comprehensive). The next day, June 24th (Monday) we called and activated the free insurance policy and also took the dog for the free vet check.

There were two findings. The dog had an ear infection and the doctor noted a subcutaneous mass on her right rear hip. He tried to do a fine needle aspiration but was unable to draw any conclusions.

On July 8th, I signed her up for health insurance through my insurance company (Progressive -&gt; Pets Best).

Today she went back to the vet for follow up on her ear infection (all gone). The doctor decided to take another try at aspirating the mass on her hip. When he came back into the room, he said that he could see ""abnormal cells"" under the microscope and he wants to send it in for pathology. We will have results tomorrow.

If this is something serious, is the insurance that I bought going to cover it? Or is it going to be useless? The doctor noted that she had a ""subcutaneous mass"" on the visit on June 24th. I assume this means it is a preexisting condition for my policy purchased on July 8th? If this is the case, though, I should be covered by the free policy from the shelter? It only covers $1000 total, maximum of $500 per incident, in that first 30 days of coverage, but I would think that I am covered, even if it only pays part of the bill? I still have the option to pay for coverage from this company and extend the insurance beyond 30 days. If I do that, am I covered or not covered?

How do I find out the answers to these questions? I am a little bit nervous about just calling the pet insurance companies in question and asking because I am sure if I answer a question wrong, I will get any claim I make denied.

This dog is young, only a year old, and she is such a good dog. I am also afraid that I am going to be ""not covered"" by insurance even though I bought a policy two weeks after adopting her because they will say, well she was probably sick when you adopted her.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting ready to travel without my dog for the first time and am trying to sort out care. I have a dog walker I love and trust, but for trips they only offer 3-4 drop-in visits each day and don&amp;#39;t do overnights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dog is very people oriented and active at a year and a half old, and I am not convinced this is sufficient. No separation anxiety, but she&amp;#39;s never been alone overnight. While I wouldn&amp;#39;t even consider this for a longer trip, I will be away for two nights so maybe it&amp;#39;s ok and would have the benefit of being someone I already trust a lot with my dog in my home. This seems like it&amp;#39;s really a much more reasonable option for much less active/much older dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

I started socializing my puppy (Corgi) based on the puppy socialization list only after he was 4 month old, probably missing the most critical period (&lt;3 month) according to the internet. I took him regularly to the dog park and different places, so he's used to playing with different dogs and is doing OK when encountering different people, sound, objects, etc. Overall, he's very well behaved when he's with me and I am very proud.

**But there is only one problem, he doesn't like to be handled by other people.**

In retrospect, this is probably due to my ignorance to raising a puppy, such that he was confined at home prior to his full vaccination.  That is, he definitely didn't meet at least 100 people before he was 3 month old.  Starting at 4 months, we started to take him outside on walks.  During walks, he will walk up to people and accept petting because he's on leash.  But at the dog park, he will avoid people if they try to pet him. Don't get me wrong, he's not scared of people.  He will get a ball to a stranger at the dog park and ask them to play fetch. Just in general he refuses to be held and handled by anyone else not in my family and is anxious when left with someone else (he's ok being left alone).  I can imagine this becomes a big problem if we need to travel and board him somewhere.  

**He's a little over 7 month old now. Is it too late to socialize him on being handled by other people?**

Any tips on how to get him enjoy petting by other people? And any suggestions on how to train him to get used to being handled by other people? I mean, I can't just walk up to a stranger on the street and ask them pet my puppy, can I?  Will sending him to a puppy daycare help (he's not neutered yet so most daycare won't accept him)? Please, any suggestions will be much appreciated.

Another relatively minor concern is that he doesn't like to initiate play with other dog. He would rather sniff around or play fetch me if no other dog approach to play with him at the dog park.  And if his playmate is intercepted by another dog, he will just walk away and mind his own business.  I know this may not be of concern.  But he's only 7 month old and should be the most playful age.  As much as I love to play fetch with him, I want him to play with other dogs more.

When my parents wake up they take him straight to the hospital where he gets the “proper” procedure done. They do the blood tests and everything looks fine. 

But when I come back, July 7 I find out about this for the first time. They hide it from me. So I just take it as best as I can and understand it was a mistake.

I don't know if this is the right place to put this.  I was trying to think of ways to reach dog lovers that might be down to help. I have a number of friends that live in Ridgecrest, which was one of the closest areas to last week's 7.1 earthquake. A lot of families in the small military town were displaced, and a lot of animals ran off as they were freaked out, by the more than 1000 earthquakes they've had in the last week.

A friend of mine, who is an animal lover, and special needs teacher in Ridgecrest, went over to check out the animal shelter to see how they were fairing in the wake of last week's crazy quakes. This is what she posted to her private fb account:  
*I went down to our animal shelter to see what they needed and as I walked through the kennels I realized that every single one was filled. It absolutely broke my heart to know that most of these dogs have endured the events of the past week alone in these kennels. As soon as I got to my car I broke down and cried. Everyone is so focused on taking care of their own families and fur babies and homes right now so I doubt many people are looking to adopt, but there are so many who need to be rescued. They will even allow you to just take a dog out into their yard and love on it and play with it if that's all that you can do. There are some Mama dogs that have been there for a long time and could use some interaction and love. I posted the list of items they need so please consider donating supplies or adopting. Giving back and helping others seems to always help in our own healing process.*

I live about 200 miles away but I primed some stuff and thought others might be interested in helping as well.

Even if you plan on never competing with your dogs, it's so helpful to have some level of training, even for a dog that is just part of the family. You can manage your dog's environment, but it's helpful to have just in case something goes wrong. In this case, I was caught off guard. Now there are things I can do in the future to make sure this doesn't happen again, but in the moment I was glad to have it.

However, sometimes management fails. I've had leashes break on me before. Not because my dog was pulling either. Murdock was just strolling next to me when the handle came apart. No one expects their leash to just fall apart on them, but when that happened there was no worry. He had a wait, he had recall. He was able to wait patiently by my side while I made a makeshift slip lead out of what remained of the leash.

I was grateful then to have learned a wait, and I was grateful today with Morgan. Both situations could have ended poorly if we didn't have that training behind us.

Or can I wash my dog right away and apply a different flea and tick product? Is there a different modality I can use to repel ticks until he&amp;#39;s due for his next treatment?

At the dog park he we very sociable with all dogs and humans, including smaller dogs and puppies. There was one incident where he was snapped at by a larger dog (who was then kicked out of the dog park by other owners) and his reaction was to get on his back and run to me after the dog had left.  After that he was back playing like normal.

&amp;#x200B;

He just returned from a week long boarding experience, and my parents said that when they picked him up the workers had said there had been a minor fight that morning. I didn't get the whole story, but apparently my dog was playing a little too exuberantly and a new dog that had just enrolled that morning had snapped and either bit his face or scratched it. The scratch/scar right on his muzzle and it's about 2 inches long with part of it going inside his mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think too much on it this past week since he was acting normal. Yesterday we went to the dog park for the first time in while and he acted the exact same as always. There were three dogs and he alternated between playing fetch with them and just running circles around the park. I took him again today and we started off great, him and the dogs there did lots of sniffing, then while I was standing at a bench he came to stand near me and three dogs (who he had been playing with)  followed him over and went to sniff some more. My dog snapped at them both with full teeth snapping in their face and letting out a weird yipping growl/bark and I had to pull him away. After the dogs left he was fine again until we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty worried now that he's turned more defensive/aggressive because what happened at the boarding. I have never seen him snap or snarl at anything before and I was shocked. I'm guessing it was a combination of being cornered by the three dogs (even though that's never caused a reaction before) and having their mouths close to his face, but it still freaked me out since before this he's always reacted submissively.

Back in January, my wife and I bought a 3 month old Chihuahua. She's about 9 months old now, and has a set of bad hips.

In May we took her to the vet and had x-rays done, after noticing a brief period of limping after she got excited around another dog. The actual vet did not sit down with us, but a vet tech explained her results. He did not use the words hip dysplasia, but said that she had a ""bad set of hips"" with flattening of the femoral head on the left side (I don't have access to the x-rays, or I would post them). He said the vet doesn't feel that surgery is appropriate for her, and we were given joint supplements to give her every other day.

We're in July now, and although she doesn't limp all the time, it seems as though any type of strenuous activity causes limping. She can't be around other dogs, because she gets very excited/hyper and runs around until she won't even put weight on the leg anymore. The other day she jumped from our couch to a nearby chair (something she doesn't usually do, but she was excited as there were people at the house) and limped for the rest of the day. Even today she was playing hard and started limping. During walks, she has a strange gait like she's dropping her butt to go pee, but it's just how she's walking.

I'm just looking for advice, and to see if anyone else has had dogs with hip problems this early in life and what their outcomes have been like. We have made a few changes to her environment (putting down carpet squares all over the house to help her get traction on the hardwood floor, got her a ramp for all the furniture, gated off the stairs so she can't hop up them), we're keeping her away from other dogs so she won't get overexcited, and trying to limit her amount of rough play (as much as you can with a puppy). She still gets her joint supplement routinely, and has carprofen on an as-needed basis. The current plan is to monitor her for frequency of limping for the next two weeks, and if she continues with it, to get another appointment with the vet.

Other than the intermittent limp, she seems like a happy dog. She still plays, she's still active, and has a healthy appetite. She doesn't show signs of discomfort in any other situation aside from when she does something strenuous or gets overexcited, although that could obviously just be that she is in pain and not showing it. So, does anyone have any suggestions or advice for what our next steps should be? Is the vet not taking it seriously enough? Are there other environmental things we should be doing, or things we haven't thought of? Or is this just going to be what her life is like? I grew up with mutts who never really needed the vet aside from a few rounds of shots, so I'm open to suggestions or advice from anyone who's dealt with this kind of thing before, especially in a dog this young.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I had a Yorkshire terrier for 16 years and an hound mix from the shelter. I am trained them both and they had AKC trick titles and CGC/CGCAs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am leaning towards a rescue. Maybe a breed-specific rescue.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Low grooming maintenance, Medium sized dog: 40 pounds prefered, low prey drive

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* A standard poodle: low shedding, biddable, smart, and generally friendly. Vizsla: I had a friend who has one and he is so loving. I really missed the velco-ness of dogs. Miniature Australian Shepherd or Border collie: I am in love with their physical appearance and their intelligence. However, the amount shedding may be not right for me.  

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Training will be an outgoing process. I would train pretty much everything from trick, obedience, and sporting activities .

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Most likely a dog sport whether be it disc dog, rally, etc. Ever since I watch Crufts years ago, I would love to try freestyle.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Training would probably be 30 minutes a day. I would play with him with him a couple times a dog. Any outside activity that is dog -friendly, I will bring him.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I would do minimum walks 30 minutes ~ 1 hour. I did use to run and use roller blades with my previous dogs so I may do that again with the future pup.  Definitely going to dog parks.  

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I always enjoyed bathing, grooming my dogs. I normally do grind my dogs' nails, brushes, and ear-cleaning weekly. When my Yorkie shed, it would be in furball stuck on the carpet. It was easy to pick up the furballs and throw it away. However, with my hound, his fur was like glitter and it would get out of hand though it did lessen with twice a week furminator.  I would prefer not to have fur glitter anymore. My dog has passed a year ago and I still would find his hairs everywhere.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium sized dog: 40 pounds preferred. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Low shedding, low barking, low slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important. I have trained previous dogs to be offleash around the community neighborhood ( I even got a real time gps tracker that would snap on their collars). 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I prefer a more snuggle one. I do not mind if the dog was in the middle ground; enjoy some time with owner but knows how to be independent. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I prefer the dog to be friendly to strangers. I do not mind a couple barks if someone knocking on the door. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I prefer not to. I enjoyed going to dog-friendly events and would still like to take my future dogs to those.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I would love to a low prey drive. I do have a pair of cockatiels and they like to hang out of their cages for 4 hours in a day. My previous dogs would leave them alone, got along with them, and I would like to keep it that way. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* At the moment I am a full time online student, finishing in a year or two. I will be picking up a part time job after that so the dog may be alone for 4~5 hours a day in the future. I of course will spend time/exercise the dog before work and afterward.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband won't really do anything. He also would prefer a dog that does not shed a lot, bark a lot, and not too big or small. He prefers a dog more independent spirit. My son would do the same activities with the dog that I do, he is my little helper. My son enjoyed grooming, walking, and playing with my dog. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have cockatiels. I may get another parrot in several years. I do cat sit for a friend every once in a while ( like a couple times a year). 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. Children under 7.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We just bought our house. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Pitbulls been restricted on banned from daycares I believe. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 95+ in the summers, under 20 degree in the weather. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. I had a Yorkshire terrier for 16 years and an hound mix from the shelter. I am trained them both and they had AKC trick titles and CGC/CGCAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a &lt;a href=""http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html""&gt;reputable breeder&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am leaning towards a rescue. Maybe a breed-specific rescue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Describe your ideal dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low grooming maintenance, Medium sized dog: 40 pounds prefered, low prey drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A standard poodle: low shedding, biddable, smart, and generally friendly. Vizsla: I had a friend who has one and he is so loving. I really missed the velco-ness of dogs. Miniature Australian Shepherd or Border collie: I am in love with their physical appearance and their intelligence. However, the amount shedding may be not right for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

A year ago, he was happy to sit on my lap and snooze, or lie next to me while I petted him peacefully. He was always a bit protective of me and would chase away the kids if they were crying or whining. Over the course of several months, though, he stopped coming over for physical interaction. He was always happy to see me, but stopped wanting physical affection. Further, while he wasn’t aggressive with me, his protectiveness turned into aggression towards the kids. He would chase them, barking and growling aggressively, back into their rooms were they to leave, particularly at night. 

I had him evaluated by his vet, who couldn’t find any source of pain or illness. While he was anesthetized for his dental, the vet performed a thorough physical and x-rays, which showed nothing out of the ordinary. He suggested we try an anti-anxiety med as Noodle is fairly high strung. We used the med for three months and saw no change. 

We contacted a trainer who had us modify behavior by offering treats when he didn’t bark and chase, and when he would come near. His behavior improved with this approach, but he still doesn’t want to be touched. He will tolerate quick pets, but he freezes and his paw goes up, indicating he’s not comfortable with it. The trainer is a bit stumped as to why he still doesn’t want to be touched. She says it’s one of the weirder cases she has taken on. There were no traumatic, catalyzing incidents as far as we know. 

Obviously, I’m sad about this, for both me and him. He is missing out on love and affection he used to seek out and enjoy, and I miss having a companion. I work from home and he is my partner and company, often lounging in my office while I work. I’m coming to the conclusion that maybe this is a sign of neurological or physical illness, but we have no idea what.

Pup's a golden retriever, currently 11 weeks old, but my sister, her husband and my niece and nephew are going away in mid-August for 4 nights. They basically called me yesterday and say they'll only say yes to this puppy if I can house watch and puppy sit for those 4 days while they're away. She says no pressure and they'll understand if I say no, but she's left me in an unfair position where I might have to disappoint an eleven-year-old girl. They shouldn't have told her that a puppy was available until I said ""yes"". I honestly think they should be cancelling their trip if they're getting a puppy, especially one so young. Can a puppy that young be left? I've got work on 2 of those days. My sister says don't worry about leaving it as they'll be leaving it when they go to work/school in the weeks leading up to the trip. Still, I'm worried even if my shifts are only for half a day (3-5 hours).

If I say yes, am I part of the problem? This is just the latest red flag. Others include:

\- My sister said it had to be a golden retriever as those were the only kind of dog she liked. When I gave her the details for some GR rescue centres, she said, ""well, if you're going to get a dog, you might as well get a puppy for the full experience.""

\- She is adamant that it will be an outside dog and it makes me anxious to think of a small puppy outside during a Brisbane winter. She doesn't want to be constantly cleaning up hair and doesn't want to risk him/her pooping in the house.

\- My 8-year-old nephew is saying he doesn't want to touch any balls the dog has had in his/her mouth. Good luck with that.

I've spoken to my mum and she's said: ""don't let them make you a crutch for when they go away"" as they like their trips. They only just went on a trip a week ago. I've told them I'll help out when I can, but it has to be on a case by case basis.

Neither I nor my sister has ever had a dog, let alone a puppy, and I think she's about to have a rude awakening on what's it's like. She seems to want the dog to fit in with their lifestyle as opposed to changing their lifestyle for the dog. I'm a little excited as I want a dog someday and this would be a good way to test whether I can handle a puppy, but I'm worried this will lead to a dog with separation anxiety. When you make a mistake, it's the animal that suffers and I don't know what I'd do if that happened.

On a separate note, is there a website that will sell puppy safe toys? I'm looking for a retriever sized soft toy as a snuggle companion to help the pup settle in.

Does anyone do puppy safe water bottles? Does such a thing exist? Don't get me wrong, if I'm looking after the puppy and he/she is crying outside in the cold, sorry sis, but I'm bringing them in, but I'm rarely going to be there.

I&amp;#39;m a little excited as I want a dog someday and this would be a good way to test whether I can handle a puppy, but I&amp;#39;m worried this will lead to a dog with separation anxiety. When you make a mistake, it&amp;#39;s the animal that suffers and I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;d do if that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a separate note, is there a website that will sell puppy safe toys? I&amp;#39;m looking for a retriever sized soft toy as a snuggle companion to help the pup settle in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone do puppy safe water bottles? Does such a thing exist? Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, if I&amp;#39;m looking after the puppy and he/she is crying outside in the cold, sorry sis, but I&amp;#39;m bringing them in, but I&amp;#39;m rarely going to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**The backstory:** My 5yo male dog (mixed breed, 65lbs) began showing symptoms of a UTI (polydipsia, polyuria and lethargy) by the middle of March. He had just had a stomach obstruction a couple of weeks before (no surgery but he got fluids and antiemetics overnight at a local emergency vet - beware pork femurs folks), so I chalked it up to recovery from that at first. I watched his behavior for 1.5-2 weeks before realizing that I wasn't being overly neurotic, it wasn't recovery, and that he needed to go back to the vet.

&amp;#x200B;

**The initial diagnosis:** That vet agreed it might be a UTI so he ordered a urinalysis and a urine culture with sensitivities at my urging (I work in the medical field, know what a UTI looks like and felt it was worth the extra money to culture his urine from the outset). His urinalysis came back pretty clear except for crystals (no blood), and his culture grew streptococcus. He was put on cephpodoxime and completed a 10 day course of treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 1st retest:** He was retested 3-4 days after the completion of treatment as advised. I don't know the results of the urinalysis because a vet didn't call me with his results (one of the front desk employees did), but his culture was negative. Now, I would be fully on board with the sentiment ""his infection just came back"" if I hadn't been adamant with the vet at that retest appointment that his symptoms (still polydipsia, polyuria &amp; lethargy) NEVER went away. This felt like a false negative of sorts (I later found out that the sample was very dilute), but at that re-test appointment the vet (a different one than the first : young, brand-new) dismissed my fears, said it was behavioral and that he looked fine. She didn't want to do the culture and said all we needed was the urinalysis (even though the first urinalysis was relatively clear). Clearly I won that battle and she did perform the culture, as evidenced by the fact that we have culture results from that visit.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2nd retest:** My poor boy continued with his UTI-like behavior for months, eventually had an accident in the house, and started licking himself so often we couldn't get through a walk without him licking multiple times per walk (like his penis was irritated). I finally called my vet's office 2-3 weeks ago requesting that a vet call me to discuss his symptoms. A third vet (with 15-18 yrs experience) returned that call. She gave alternatives for the behavior (many of which I had already considered), but ultimately said she'd want him rechecked as well. I made the appointment, but ended up with that second vet from the first retest (the brand new one) who, again, argued with me about the culture and didn't want to do it. I won that battle as well, and she performed the culture with sensitivities which was... wait for it... POSITIVE for the same damn strain of streptococcus as before. Urinalysis was mostly clear except for crystals and abnormal pH (I was on an noisy train, having a hard time hearing her and cannot remember if it was more acidic or basic)... but still no blood.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now:** My baby is now on a 3 per day, 2 week course of clavamox. He started vomiting profusely a little more than 48 hours into treatment, so I withheld  one of his doses until the office opened and I could speak to vet for instructions on how to proceed (otherwise we've kept to a strict schedule). He is now on cerenia for the nausea, and I am supplementing his meals with probiotics. The nausea seems in check, but his UTI symptoms are STILL going so strong 4-5 days into his treatment. I have an appointment in \~2 weeks (7 days after he finishes his medication) for a retest. I will be requesting imaging to check for stones at that appointment because at this point he has had this for nearly 4 months now, crystals have been consistently present in his urinalysis, and I am NOT making him wait until he is symptomatic again (presuming he will be asymptomatic) before we check for them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions &amp; TL; DR:** My dog has had a UTI for \~4 months and is 4-5 days into his second antibiotic (clavamox) for it. He is still lethargic, has polydipsia, and is licking his penis continually. When should I start seeing his symptoms subside? What else I can do to ease his discomfort? Should I be asking this in /r/askvet? Has anyone else had an experience like this, especially with a male dog? At this point, I *am* the overly neurotic pet parent I was worried about being at the beginning of this! He has been suffering with this for so long, and I feel so bad. I just want my spunky super-hyper boy back.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone has advice, reassurance or experience with chronic/ongoing or male UTI&amp;#39;s, I&amp;#39;d greatly appreciate hearing from you... regardless of whether or not you take the time to read.&lt;/p&gt;

I have two.

I spend a lot of time and money on these dogs, I love them to pieces. We're buying a car that can specifically accommodate them comfortably. We go on a lot of road trips, and pay premiums for places that allow dogs, with dog fees attached. It ends up being quite a bit.

I don't think I can financially take on another dog, because I will get additional pet insurance, and Nexgard and heartgard, and vet visits, and we'll now have three dogs to travel with. It's just not in the budget.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you will tell me to not get another dog that&amp;#39;s outside of my budget. But what about giving it a good home, at least from the perspective of people who love them, without all of this stuff? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just neurotic for spending all of this money at the expense of helping another dog that we have the space and the yard and the love to accommodate? What if I didn&amp;#39;t spend any of it, and stuck with the bare minimums?&lt;/p&gt;

So,  there is the most, perfect dog who needs a home. An adorable, super well  behaved puppy, the runt of the litter, as soon as I saw he was perfect.  He's only 2 months old I believe. [Some sort of collie mix I think.](https://imgur.com/ruKThDr)

I grew up around golden retrievers, so I'm not totally ignorant on how to take care of a dog, but I've never raised one myself.

The  big thing is, I live alone, and I'm typically at work 8 hours a day. I  know that they need stimulation, and he'll definitely need some walks. I  can rely on a friend to stop by maybe a few days a week.

Being  that I've never actually raised a dog, I want to know how to keep him  properly mentally stimulated, keep him happy, and what sort of diet he  should have. I also want to do dog training, but all of the classes here  are in Korean, and I'm not a good enough speaker to attend. So  puppy/obedience training would have to be without help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey! Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and I'm wondering how much of what we're experiencing is just normal adjustment behavior or if it's something with which we need to be more concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

Not quite 2 weeks ago, we adopted a bonded pair from the shelter - hound mixes about 2-3 years old, male - Cooper, female - Poppy.  Nothing much is known about them other than they were found together and appeared to be healthy.  They were in the shelter on hold for 10 days and subsequently ended up in a foster home for 5 days and then we adopted them from there.  Everyone at the shelter and the foster home raved about how sweet these dogs are.  And they really are so that's why I'm hoping some things we're seeing are general ""I'm settling into my new home"" things.   (FTR - our previous dog passed away in the fall at 15 and we had him since he was a puppy so we aren't new dog owners but it's been a long time since we've had young dog.)

&amp;#x200B;

My husband was initially opposed to crating them but after the first 5 days of no sleep and some accidents in the house along with some destructive behaviors the couple of times we left them, he agreed.  Crate training is going relatively well but I think we made a mistake in that we only bought one large crate so they could sleep together.  They haven't had to be in the crate much during the day and aren't thrilled with it, Poppy in particular.  She definitely whines and barks when she first goes in during the day but she goes in easily enough and I spent some time listening and she settles within a few minutes.  We're going to keep working on positive crate training.  Nighttime, they've slept in it with no issues but last night Cooper definitely growled at Poppy over the kongs.  I took them out and they went to sleep but it made me start to think that having them crated together isn't the best idea so we've ordered two crates that will be here tomorrow. I do worry that Poppy is displaying a little separation anxiety but I'm thinking maybe she is just going to take some time to get comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Other issue - today we we're playing with some new toys that I had gotten them.  They had played for about 20 minutes and I picked the toys up to put them away because they were starting to just want to shred them.  Well, Poppy approached Cooper to lay beside him and he definitely was aggressive.  He start snarling and posturing, starting to grab at her and she returned the gesture.  I grabbed her by the back legs since she was closest and told them no and that was the end of it.  They are playing together fine right now.  

&amp;#x200B;

So do I just need to relax?  They've obviously had a ton of changes over the last month and they haven't even been in our house as long as they were at the shelter.  We're working on training sessions, giving them 1-2 walks a day, plus playing with them in our fenced yard.

I currently use a IDC blue belt harness as I thought it would be cooler. it is a little bit cooler but obviously the straps are the same thickness, so the entire harness is thicker. It's a bit hard to adjust but a well good harness to say the least. My dog hasn't had any movement issues since going on the harness nor any fur rubbing off. She was prone to that with her previous harness. 

I use julius K9 as I like the handle on their harnesses, the changable labels and how easy they are to put on and adjust. My dog finds it just fine. Only problem I've had is that sometimes my dog's paw can get up and out of the harness but I bought a Y belt which has solved the problem and has helped distribute the pressure. I love the amount of customisation with side bags, chest belts and labels. And it isn't a bad price for a high quality harness that has videos of strength testing. £25.59 in the UK to buy this harness, £31.99 normal price as I got mines on sale from https://julius-k9.co.uk/ as it's the cheapest place and with it being an actual stockist it's legit.

I've never been a dog person because of experiences in my childhood with aggressive dogs or dogs that just rush onto you. 

The problem is that my husband made it very clear in the last months that he expects us to get a dog when we're having kids, so that I can take care of the pup since I'll be home anyway due to the baby. Only problems are my past experiences with dogs. 

When I was beginning elementary school I had a friend whose Lasaaptzu was not trained at all and would instantly hump my leg or lightly bite my ankles when I entered their apartment. When I visited my grandma it was almost the same with her Shitzu. On my way home from school there were Jack Russell Terriers who might bite your ankles if you were riding a bicycle. Those and other, similar, experiences led me away from dogs. In addition I just can't stand the idea of picking up their poop, having my face licked by some animal that licks its own anus or having ticks and fleas in my home.

In addition I fear my kids to be bitten by a dog or experiencing the same stuff I did.

Knowing my husband he will play very wildly with the dog, which fears me the most since I don't like dogs being wild and unpredictable. I fear that he makes the dog more wild by playing with him that way. If we ever get a dog I want it to be calm. 
Also I react a little allergic to dogs with a stuffed nose. 

I would appreciate any advice you can give me. Should we still get a dog? Is there a specific breed of dog we could consider?

I have 2 male Huskies that have been together since they were born, actual brothers. They get along, they play, and they never fight.

My brother got a Husky, from the same family, and his landlord threaten to evict him over the dog, so he asked me to to keep him until he gets his own place.

Here's the problem.

One of my Huskies and his do not get along. They want to fight. All the time. I keep them separate.

My other Husky got along great with my brother's but, for some reason, my other Husky no longer likes him.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get the dogs to get along. I don't want them to keep being this way, I want them to get along. 

Things I've tried are:

1) walking them around the yard in close proximity. Didn't work because they only wanted to fight.

2) putting muzzles on them and allowing them to go at it (their feet were covered so they would scratch). In the process of fighting, their muzzles came off and one of the dogs got a cut on his nose. Nothing serious but it could have been.

3) now I have both of them in cages next to each other. They continue to want to kill each other so I  have a blanket covering one side so they can calm down.

Any and all advice will help. Please. I thank everyone who has taken the time to read this and for any advice given.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted on the Husky Reddit but also wanted to post here to get more feedback and help if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

We've had her since she was 8 weeks old and she was afraid of a lot of things as a small puppy (stairs, anything that rolled, any strange noises, etc). She's now 4 and has gotten much better. Still, when we'd go out in public you could tell from her body language she was nervous (if we took a break she'd crawl under our bench, and if you touched her she'd be shaking) but always seems to enjoy going out and gets really excited when I grab her leash, and always seemed mostly happy to be out in the world and would even go up and say hi to people and occasionally other dogs. She's always been super friendly to both people and other dogs.

Lately it seems like her anxiety has really gotten much worse. I'm honestly starting to wonder if it is even anxiety and not a neurological problem. Her back legs tremble pretty much all the time now if she is standing. She used to just be a little shaky in public, or unfamiliar environments, but now she does it even inside of the house. If she is standing, her back legs are shaking. She still gets really excited when I grab her leash and happily jumps into the car to join me on adventures. She still enjoys cuddling and coming up for pets. But she just trembles... all the time.

She had her annual vet visit about a month ago and we put her on anti-anxiety meds (I think it's the generic version of prozac). The vet said it could take a few weeks before it took affect, but it's been almost a full month on the medication now and no changes. The vet also seemed fairly confident it was just anxiety, and probably not a neurological or degenerative disorder. But how quickly her trembling has gotten worse has me quite nervous. She is only four. Only in the past 6 months or so has her shaking been *this* bad pretty much all of the time. As a puppy she was shy, but not this level of shakiness or anxiety. I can't identify any triggers or traumatic experiences she's had that may have caused this change either.

Anyone have any ideas? Should I push for more testing?

So several weeks ago mis-clipped one of his nails. He never liked nail clipping before that but this put him over the edge.

Anyway, I've been trying to desensitize him via playing/touching his paws, giving treats when he allows me to and sits still. He is still DEATHLY afraid of the nail clippers and will flinch even if I light brush them against his paw/nail. I try treating him for this too but every time I hold his paw with the clippers in my hand he jumps away or tries to roll and I let go, I'm too afraid he'll pull too hard one day and hurt himself.

Does anyone have any suggestions for the plan moving forward? I'm losing patience with the desensitization. Unfortunately, we also have soft wood floors so there's some damage.

Let me preface this by saying that my dog is a 2.5 year old cane corso mastiff so stubbornness is in their DNA. However, it has reached an all time high. To be brutally honest, I'm losing my rule of the house and I'm 100% responsible for that. Murphy was diagnosed with heartworm disease and hes almost out of the woods. During that time, I tried so hard just to make him happy. Let him sleep on the bed with me, lay outside whenever he wanted, and spoil him relentlessly. 

Now he will whine constantly till I move so he can lay in my spot where I'm sitting. I've tried leaving the room to teach him a lesson but he still gets what he wants. I tell him to stop and each time I look away, he whines loudly and occasionally barks. He wont respond when I command him to ""come here"". Just blatant stubbornness. It gets really difficult to not be stern or yell. We did well for so long and I don't know if I cant get it all back on track.

As for the fearfulness of me, this is what breaks my heart the most. His ears go all the way back when I just try to pet him at times. Hes got his big floppy ears so I have to go in and clean them sometimes. This clearly bothers him but hes gotten an ear infection before and I'm trying to prevent that from happening again. I give him copious amount of treats after but it doesnt really help. 

The worst thing is that he gets REALLY BAD  folliculitis and/or furunculosis(canine acne) on his chin. I've had to get medicated chin wipes, sprays, and all sorts of stuff just to try and help them to heal. But they clearly cause him pain so when I try to apply these things, its hurting him. I just wish he knew I was trying to help. 

So my dog is stubborn and is scared of me. I'm at such a loss and really broken up about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

With my  fiance moved in and her cat, myself and my German Shepherd, a 48"" dog crate for Luna is making my place really crammed since I've also had to  turn my home into a home-office to work from home.

Luna  was crated as a puppy for potty training as was advised by the sub when  I first got her. I absolutely recommend it.  But she doesn't really  sleep in there during the night now.  She is allowed on all the  furniture, including the bed, and will sleep either in the hallway, on  the couch, or in the crate.  She spends more time in the hallway than anything - guard dog mentality, I guess, and it's cool on the floor over there.  In the past two years I've closed the crate door maybe 3 times  for 15 minutes each time.  The only reason I've had to keep the crate  was as a way to keep her somewhere in case we had company because she  can be reactive to strangers, but she's not that bad and we have a  balcony we can put her on for 15 minutes while the super comes in for  repairs or something.  That and pet gate for the kitchen if we need to.

Would  it be horrible of us to take her crate away so we can replace furniture  and make the space more functional?  We really just need more floor space, and removing a 48"" crate would really help.

PS:  Please don't pick on me for having a German Shepherd in a Bachelor. I  got her years ago and I can't change it now. And when I got her I  watched a lot of Dogs 101 and they said GSDs are adaptable to small spaces.

But she doesn&amp;#39;t really  sleep in there during the night now.  She is allowed on all the  furniture, including the bed, and will sleep either in the hallway, on  the couch, or in the crate.  She spends more time in the hallway than anything - guard dog mentality, I guess, and it&amp;#39;s cool on the floor over there.  In the past two years I&amp;#39;ve closed the crate door maybe 3 times  for 15 minutes each time.  The only reason I&amp;#39;ve had to keep the crate  was as a way to keep her somewhere in case we had company because she  can be reactive to strangers, but she&amp;#39;s not that bad and we have a  balcony we can put her on for 15 minutes while the super comes in for  repairs or something.  That and pet gate for the kitchen if we need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would  it be horrible of us to take her crate away so we can replace furniture  and make the space more functional?  We really just need more floor space, and removing a 48&amp;quot; crate would really help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS:  Please don&amp;#39;t pick on me for having a German Shepherd in a Bachelor. I  got her years ago and I can&amp;#39;t change it now. And when I got her I  watched a lot of Dogs 101 and they said GSDs are adaptable to small spaces.&lt;br/&gt;

They do not read the reviews you leave. They create a ticket for us to see but are automatically solved out even with a 1 star rating for the sitter. 

I have seen multiple horrifying things: 

Dog dies in sitters care? Trust &amp; Safety team will only help if you sign a Non Disclosure Agreement. Even though it is 100% due to sitter/sitter negligence. Sitter is still on the platform. 

Dog sitter known outside of Rover for Animal Cruelty? As long as you're not convicted of anything and it doesn't happen with anyone going through Rover: not Rover's problem. Sitter is still on the platform. 

Dog Owner leaves dog with Sitter and when Owner gets back 10 days later same dog is missing part of its tail? Nothing was done because ""it was reported over two months after incident"". Sitter is still on the platform. 

Oh you're a sitter? Well an owner can threaten you for a simple mistake you made, like falling asleep, and as long as they threaten Rover with going to social media they are given what ever you want. 

Don't expect them to remove any bad reviews no matter what is said because you can reply to the review. Replies that can't be seen on the app... the app which 80% of Rover users use instead of the website. 

Oh you're an owner? Didn't get what you wanted? Go to social media and they'll give you everything you ask for and a blowjob for good measure. 

You're an owner and you fear for your safety so you don't want to share your feedback publicly? That means no matter what happened we won't send it to our Quality team but we'll put a note on the sitter's profile. The sitter will never see nor hear any coaching or consequence because you feared for your safety. 

Every sitter has passed a background check? Nope. They have all HAD a background check. Passing it is another story. 

As customer service Representatives we were told to not ask if a caller/emailers needed more assistance, not give out our phone number, and not to say we were 24/7. Because we didn't want them to call back as it just cost Rover money.

She's been giving anti-biotics from some vets and is doing much better being active but they couldnt give me a clear answer on the problem(3 vets we went to)

Info: Female, not spayed, last heat cycle about a week ago

It started around 4am yesterday morning. A Few hours after we noticed her behavior, she got a swollen lump below one of her upper nipples. She gets these once in a blue moon in different areas but usually goes away after a few days.

I read this could be a lymph node thats enlarged because of possible infections(get filled with white blood cells) or maybe just a swollen gland because she is not spayed(We will be doing that ASAP when this hopefully goes away). It was excreting stuff the same nipple where it's located, likely milk. It doesn't seem like it alarmed the vets we went to since they were more worried about her not active or looking really pale/sad.

We took her to a few vets and they all gave different answers like pyometra, cancer, infection from not being spayed, maybe ate something. ultrasound seemed to have ruled out pyometra.

It could just be swollen from an infection and since she's doing much better, could go away.

Sorry if this isn't allowed here but we really don't know where to go with it before spending lots more money for no reason if it's gonna go away since she's feeling better.

I'm at a loss for what restraint system I should get my dog in the car! I drive a standard Prius and she's a 65 lb Labrador. Because of the hatchback slope, I can't fit a big enough crate in the trunk (it would need to be in the rear seats).

Options seem to be: [Ruffwear Load Up](https://ruffwear.com/products/load-up-harness), [Sleepypod Terrain](http://sleepypod.com/terrain1)  (or Sport!), or a [crate](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/90654?page=ruff-tough-kennel-intermediate) (most likely Large Ruff Tuff Kennel aka Ruff Land) in the rear seats. 

There are pros and cons to each!

* Sleepypod ($97) - supposedly crash tested by a third party (CPS), but the conditions tested under are apparently slightly misleading. Two attachment points. Crash tested to her weight (65 lbs). Apparently very restrictive, risk of tangling, hard to put on.
* Ruffwear ($80) - failed the third party testing (CPS) but has passed Ruffwear's testing. One attachment point. Only crash tested to 50 lbs. Less restrictive, so dogs supposedly like it more. Still hard to put on.
* Crate (large RTK $350) - I bought an intermediate RTK and it was way too small (she had to curl up). A large kennel would take up the entire back seat. It's also the most expensive option. But, maybe the safest.

If anyone, has any advice, I would love to hear it, especially if you drive a Prius or have used these restraint systems.

(I live in Canada) I've been housesitting + pet sitting for a couple people, both cats and dogs alike.

I got referred to someone via word of mouth. However, now that I am growing more of a clientele besides close family/friends and whatnot I'm having a hard time deciding what would be considered reasonable.

I mostly do live in house for days/nights until owners get back type of deal.

***That being said I would love what everyone would say is reasonable for anything, visits, walkings, days, overnights, staying at place etc...***

Currently though through the referral I am now helping out a couple with their two older dogs.

One has arthritis in back legs, sometimes he falls when goes down ramp or whatnot and I help adjust him. He gets two medications in the morning with breakfast and one late evening past suppertime feeding. The other has 5 different bottles of eyedrops, needing to be administered 3x a day. Then has alternating days taking 1 pill one day and then 1 pill another day. They also both get a vitamin pill in the morning. The one dog got an eye infection so I fetched their prescription and administering that as well on top of many ""pukes"" that occur with meds.

I'm currently helping them, staying at their place almost completely aside from going to my job for 8hrs max, at $25/""night"" so from 14th until 18th and in that it would be considered 4 ""nights"" (4x25 = $100), **is that an okay rate?

It was a really thorough identification test to determine what breeds are likely in a dog based on specific physical traits.
It was very in-depth, around 50 questions with lots of answers each such as lower muzzle size/shape, ear shape, ear hang, occiput prominence, jowl size, coat type, markings, webbing of paws etc.

It covered every base and seemed very helpful, especially moreso than the quizzes I'm finding now.

Googling just shows me DNA tests and shitty quizzes. 

It was a rather plain site from memory, text based and in a table format.

He likes to play with the other dogs. He’s never been around kids besides at the dog park. 

The first time he was around a kid at the dog park he was a puppy. A kid started running, and he chased the kid and nipped him from behind. But as he was a puppy and it wasn’t as big of a deal. I apologized, and they said it was fine. I starting leaving dog parks when kids under than six/seven walked in. After awhile, I got his recall solid and I taught him a leave it and he never chased another kid again. This also happened because I got my friend to run and I told him to “leave it” multiple times so he understood that people weren’t for chasing 

Now back to what happened. Him nipping that kid was 2.5y ago. He’s three now. He’s been around plenty of kids since, but only at dog parks. He doesn’t usually notice him because he’s distracted with play. 

So, today this guy at the park keeps talking to me. And then he tells me his wife is coming with his kid and he wants me to meet them. I do meet them when they come in, but I wanted to leave because I don’t like keeping my dog around kids that young. It’s a problem waiting to happen. The kid is around two, and he’s just standing around. They’ve been there for two minutes, no annoying kid habits yet, and my dog just walks by him and nips him and starts jumping around him. There was zero reason for him to start randomly wanting to play with this kid.

Aahhhhhhhhh, terrible situation. The mom freaked out of course. I grabbed him, and started apologizing a hundred times. The dad was nice and he was like, “it’s cool, don’t worry about it.” And it didn’t leave a mark or anything, it was a light nip, but I have no clue why it happened or what would possess my dog to do that when he has never done that to an adult in his adult life 

I kept apologizing, and they said it was fine and not to worry about it so at least they were nice about the whole thing. They even said, “It’s cool. We broke the rules by bringing our kid here,” which was surprising, to say the least. Most parents don’t acknowledge their breaking the rules by bringing their kids. They left after that, and so did I. 

What can I do going forward? I don’t want to stop going to dog parks because of this, but I haven’t been since this happened because I’m stressed out by the whole thing. 

Why did it happen? Why did my dog randomly do that? He’s not aggressive... So why did this happen? Would it be terrible to still go to dog parks? I’ll leave as soon as I even think I see a kid. I don’t want anything like this to happened again. It’s just so weird because my dog has been around plenty of kids before at this same dog park, and he just ignores them/avoids them. One even grabbed a squeaky ball and squeaked it for ten minutes, and he didn’t nip her or try to take the ball, and it was his favorite toy that he goes crazy for. So, what causes this? And what should I do in the future? Is this something worth seeing a behavioralist over? 

What I’m guessing happened is that the mom and kid walked in with no dog. When he saw us meeting, he walked over and tried to play with the kid since they didn’t bring in a dog? I think that’s what happened because all the kids that come to my dog park usually walk in with dogs, and this time they didn’t have one.

Aanndddd... I gave her my number and name in case their was a problem or something. I thought that was the nice thing to do, was that a good idea?

I’m pet sitting overnight for a family in my neighborhood that has 5 dogs, all King Charles cavaliers (Is this weird? It seems super weird..) 

I’d been to their house before to babysit so wasn’t focused on the dogs and didn’t notice how bad they are. I still have 5 full days of dogsitting and I’m starting to go a little crazy and was wondering if anyone has any tips/ advice on how to handle the situation. 

These dogs are HORRIBLY untrained. I hate even walking into the house because they jump on me and scratch my legs really bad and I have to kind of push them off me which makes me feel guilty. I’ve cleaned up 4-5 poops in the house every day so far, even after going outside with them every 2 hours or so and trying to be out there with them until they go to the bathroom. I was given no instructions about walking them and don’t even think I could handle all of them at a time. 

Every second I am at the house they are jumping on me and barking and needing my full attention. I can’t even walk from one room to another without a full freak out. Even when I was in the shower they were scratching on the door and barking the entire time. All of the dogs sleep in the bed with the owners, and that’s what I had posted on the petsitting subreddit about because after the first night I knew there was no way I was going to be able to sleep with them every night. They jumped on me and woke me up and snored and the amount of dog hair in the bed felt really gross. Figured that out by laying in bed with them until they calmed down and then sneaking into a different room to actually sleep. They run to where the treat container is like 10 times a day and start freaking out when I don’t give them one every single time, but it feels weird giving them so many treats when for example they go outside and don’t go to the bathroom and then want a treat before they pee in the house 2 seconds later. 

The owners said the dogs could be left alone 3 hours at a time, but basically I feel guilty because even though I haven’t left them alone for more than that amount of time it is really hard to spend time in that house with them especially because I need to be studying and can’t get anything done when I’m there because of how needy the dogs are and how much they bark/ whine. Does anyone have a similar experience and have advice on how much time I need to spend physically at the house during the day, or any tips to help them calm down so they’re more bearable to be around? I don’t know what to do because they are really cute sweet dogs but it’s so hard to be with them it’s giving me anxiety and is kind of a miserable job.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already posted on the pet sitting subreddit with a more specific question but I’m really needing some general advice.

All of the dogs sleep in the bed with the owners, and that’s what I had posted on the petsitting subreddit about because after the first night I knew there was no way I was going to be able to sleep with them every night. They jumped on me and woke me up and snored and the amount of dog hair in the bed felt really gross. Figured that out by laying in bed with them until they calmed down and then sneaking into a different room to actually sleep. They run to where the treat container is like 10 times a day and start freaking out when I don’t give them one every single time, but it feels weird giving them so many treats when for example they go outside and don’t go to the bathroom and then want a treat before they pee in the house 2 seconds later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owners said the dogs could be left alone 3 hours at a time, but basically I feel guilty because even though I haven’t left them alone for more than that amount of time it is really hard to spend time in that house with them especially because I need to be studying and can’t get anything done when I’m there because of how needy the dogs are and how much they bark/ whine. Does anyone have a similar experience and have advice on how much time I need to spend physically at the house during the day, or any tips to help them calm down so they’re more bearable to be around? I don’t know what to do because they are really cute sweet dogs but it’s so hard to be with them it’s giving me anxiety and is kind of a miserable job.&lt;/p&gt;

For a bit of insight, I have a 1 year old son and a 3 year old daughter. We also have an 8 year old pug who is completely blind.

Our pug is awesome- he loves to sit on the couch and snuggle the kids all day. However, if he goes outside in the yard and hears a noise (he always does) he will bark nonstop until you bring him in. I’m sure it has to do with the fact that he’s blind but it’s awful. 

Last week, my family went on a trip and we left my pug at my parents house. They have a pug, a Yorkie, and a 6 month old golden retriever. My pug and the golden LOVED each other and he was much calmer with the other dogs outside than he is at home. 

My husband and I took that as a sign that we should get another dog. The kids would love a dog to play fetch with and take to the park anyway. Our blind dog can’t do those things.  

The hard part is finding the right dog. We would love a golden. I grew up with them and my parents and brother have always gotten theirs from a local breeder. The dogs are always great. Finding a golden to rescue is rare but we aren’t in a rush and are willing to wait for the right dog regardless of breed.

The idea of adopting an adult dog sounds great to us. I’m already potty training humans for the next few years. I don’t love the idea of a puppy too lol. Plus, puppies and toddlers are so unpredictable. I am a stay at home mom though and my husband can bring a dog to work with him so we would both have the ability to train and care for a puppy if we chose that route.

Plus, puppies and toddlers are so unpredictable. I am a stay at home mom though and my husband can bring a dog to work with him so we would both have the ability to train and care for a puppy if we chose that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Should I go with the breeder I know is good or wait for the perfect dog to come in to the shelter?&lt;/p&gt;

I  have a soon-to-be 2 year-old rescue. I adopted her about 10 months ago, she had just turned one. We believe she is a mix between a German Shepherd and an Australian Shepherd, and that she has some dingo in her  as well. 

She truly is the happiest, most loving dog I, or anyone who knows her, has ever met. Her life motto is ""A stranger is just a friend I  have yet to meet"". She is ALWAYS happy, I swear. And the most loving dog as well, she just loves every single  living creature. That's not to say she is not protective though.

I adopted her knowing she had  seizures, as she was on Keppra (500mg twice a day) and was not having  any seizures on it. Tests were done to try and determine the origins of the seizures, but we couldn't find anything.

In December, she unfortunately developed Addison's disease, so she's on Prednisone daily, and we go to the vet every 28  days for her shot. She also has bad food allergies and needs to be fed  home cooked meals because of it, and she has an atrial septal defect for which she currently is not on medication, but she gets tested every 6 months for it.

The vet and I lowered the Keppra dosage to 500mg once a day, and it works perfectly as long as she gets her one pill a day.

She had one seizure back in February, that happened because I found out she had been cheeking her pills, and spitting them out while I wasn't looking. The seizure wasn't too bad. It happened at night: she was laying in her bed, and her legs started shaking, and she peed herself. I held her to make sure she didn't get hurt. When she came to, she was obviously confused. She growled at me once, so I left the room to give her space, and waited for her to come to me, which she did after just a few minutes.

Last night, she had a seizure. I think I forgot to give her her pill yesterday, and, after I went looking for it  this morning, found a pill in a corner of  the living room that I think she cheeked and spit the day before that. While she can go with one missed pill, two is too much. Her seizure was longer, and more impressive this time. She was also much more confused.

She left my bedroom and went to the living room after the seizure. When I tried to follow her, she started growling and baring her teeth at me. She was staring at  me from the living room, down the corridor, and her whole body language  was that of a dog that was scared, but ready to attack. I remained in my room, and gave her 20 minutes to calm down. After 20 minutes, I went to the threshold of my bedroom, and she hadn't moved. She started repeatedly barking at me, in her big voice, which she only uses when she's being protective.

She wouldn't recognise me no matter what I did, and just kept barking. I found some food in my bedroom, so I slid some of it on the ground, all the way to her. And she  just... snapped out of it. Ate the food, while wagging her tail at me,  then came to me, and she was happy to see me.

I  usually give her her meds in the morning, but I'm going to give it to her before bed now. I've already put a daily alarm to make sure I never forget again.

What I want to know is, should this ever happen again, what is the best way to react if she gets aggressive again?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

During the house breaking phase, he just won&amp;#39;t have access to anywhere near it until he&amp;#39;s fully consistent on pottying outside .. but the time will come when we&amp;#39;ll have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you keep your small breed dogs out of the litter box?&lt;/p&gt;

A couple days after we got our dog from what we quickly realized was a backyard breeder, Koda starter bobbing his head and it scared the crap out of us. We went to MSU's emergency vet who basically wanted us to leave spending $5,000 in diagnostic testing to possibly identity the cause of what was going on with him. We opted to not do that, because Koda otherwise can function when he starts his ""bobbing"". He can listen to commands and is just as responsive as he usually is when he starts to bob.

We haven't found the exact cause and the bobbing hasn't had any noticeable long-term effects. He's been doing it for 6 years (as long as we've had him), and it comes and goes. When he first started doing it, it was fairly regular. Every couple days or so.  

Now, it seems he only does it after a ""stressful"" event, e.g. he did it when he came home from the groomer once for about 5 minutes, then he did it on a separate occasion after coming home from a weekend being boarded. And, thinking back on bringing him to new home to become a member of our pack...this probably also was a stressful event.

He usually snaps out of it by us trying to distract him, spitting out commands rapid fire as shown in this video. https://youtu.be/g3YaX52ZJco

Apologies for the wall of text. I had two dogs. I love both of them but the one in this story is my absolute best buddy. We have such a special connection. I got him as a puppy (he just turned 5) and he was one of the sweetest dogs ever. For his early life at least. 

When he was 6 months old my wife had her wedding ring stolen at a hotel and while the police were ripping the room apart my dog swallowed an apple iphone plug. Not the cord. The whole wall plug. He had emergency surgery which lowered his immune system and led to his demodex going rampant. The demodex was uncontrollable and the doctors put him on ivermectin. Turns out he had a rare sensitivity and almost died from it. So right off the bat hes spending much more time at the vet than a normal dog. This is when his anxiety started. 

To combat the demodex he needed to go for weekly skin dips at the vet. He had a long standing relationship with the vets dogs and played with them often (since he was there so much). While he was playing with one of the vets dogs his other dog took it as too aggressive and attacked him. The larger dog pinned him down and went for his neck. He got loose but that increased his anxiety and made him afraid of dogs. 

His ongoing skin issues were also tackled with allergy shots at home. My wife went to go give him his monthly shot and my dog turned quickly and the needle went right through his eye. The vets were able to save his eye but this led to increasing his anxiety, developing fear of people, and giving him trust issues of those around him. 

From all of this he developed triggers that were untrainable. He was on prozac which lowered his overall anxiety but once he got triggered there was no coming back. He would become a different dog and go into full fear/attack mode. Generally he air snapped but once in a while made contact. He didn't do damage but his triggers were so random it got a bit scary. 

We had a baby a year ago and she just started running around. She would chase him because she thought it was hilarious that he would try to run away from her. Obviously we would separate them as much as possible but he always wanted to be around my other dog (who is amazing with the baby). 

My family, my vet, other vets, and other people told me his random triggers were too dangerous to have around the baby. Sure he hadn’t drawn blood yet but one time could be too much. We took him to a behavior vet specialist and got the same response. The fear was too ingrained at this point. Sometimes fear is irrational but in his case his life experiences tell him its 100% rational. He was hurt by those he loved. 

Yesterday I finally gave in to what everyone was telling me and I put him down. I’ve lost family members (this week in fact), i’ve lost other animals, but nothing in my life has ever felt like this. I feel like I betrayed him and i’m absolutely destroyed. I did’t put down a sick animal that was in pain, i failed my best friend. I recognize that I put him down as a precaution but that's a painful thought. I killed my buddy for a “what if”. What's worse is nothing new happened. He didn’t attack anyone in the last few days that made me say “ok now its time”. I just did it because i know the one time he goes off the wall with my daughter could be all it takes. But he never drew blood before. Did i do the right thing? 

This feels so terrible and I miss him already.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the wall of text. I had two dogs. I love both of them but the one in this story is my absolute best buddy. We have such a special connection. I got him as a puppy (he just turned 5) and he was one of the sweetest dogs ever. For his early life at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was 6 months old my wife had her wedding ring stolen at a hotel and while the police were ripping the room apart my dog swallowed an apple iphone plug. Not the cord. The whole wall plug. He had emergency surgery which lowered his immune system and led to his demodex going rampant. The demodex was uncontrollable and the doctors put him on ivermectin. Turns out he had a rare sensitivity and almost died from it. So right off the bat hes spending much more time at the vet than a normal dog. This is when his anxiety started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat the demodex he needed to go for weekly skin dips at the vet. He had a long standing relationship with the vets dogs and played with them often (since he was there so much). While he was playing with one of the vets dogs his other dog took it as too aggressive and attacked him. The larger dog pinned him down and went for his neck. He got loose but that increased his anxiety and made him afraid of dogs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His ongoing skin issues were also tackled with allergy shots at home. My wife went to go give him his monthly shot and my dog turned quickly and the needle went right through his eye. The vets were able to save his eye but this led to increasing his anxiety, developing fear of people, and giving him trust issues of those around him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all of this he developed triggers that were untrainable. He was on prozac which lowered his overall anxiety but once he got triggered there was no coming back.

For reference our house is on the corner of two streets, our driveway, garage, and front of the house faces one street and there is a long line of fence (chain-link I believe 8ft high, large enough gaps for a child to stick their hand through) and the gate to our backyard facing the other, you can’t see the gate side of the house from the front. 

So my family and I were packing for our camping trip (if anyone is wondering from my post yesterday Cana was allowed to come!)and bringing stuff out to my dads truck, the dogs were in the backyard running around and playing while we worked. There were about 10 kids running around the neighborhood, which wasn’t uncommon as there are a lot of kids where we live. I heard a bunch of kids yelling from the side of the house so I decided to see what all the commotion was about and what I found was a small kid (about 7 or 8) trying to get the dogs to come over to the fence with a piece of ham. I went over and told them to stop, I explained that you should never stick your hand through a fence with an unfamiliar dog on the other side and that if you wanted to pet them you should have just asked as I was outside anyway. Also that there are posted “dog on premises, no trespassing” signs every 10ft on the fence and that you should always be mindful of those. They said OK and that they were sorry and went away, I thought that would be the end of it but no, they came back 15 minutes later. This time I found one of them trying to unlatch the gate so they could get in, again I gave them the same lecture and sent them on their way, except now I told them that if I saw them on the property again I would be calling both their parents and the police. Another half hour later I found them again on the property, this time they had gotten the gate open and were in the backyard trying to get our GSD King to play with a ball and he was having none of it, trying to get as far away from them as possible and barking (that’s how I knew something was wrong as well). I put both King and Cana inside and sat them all down on the porch, me and my dad called the parents, we had a big conversation on how what they did was in no way safe and how it could have ended very badly. The parents arrived and my dad made the decision not to involve the police (I still think he should have but I digress). 

Anyway, I’m thankful no one got hurt and I’m hoping me and my dad got through to those kids. The thing that pissed me off is the fact that even after multiple verbal and written warnings from me they continued to try and do it. Plus I even said they could pet them if they asked but no one took me up on that!
