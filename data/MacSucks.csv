That statement is completely bass ackwards! In 2016, my g4 Mac Pro tower finally crashed. It was 13 years old! It started life in 2003 as a work computer for the first few years of it's life powered on — computing graphics with PhotoShop, Illustrator and QuarkXpress —10 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 years. Then it became my home computer and for the next 4 years it was in constant use as my digital music studio. It remained fast, never crashed, never froze up. I could work with 6 programs open at the same time switching seamlessly from one to the next; websites popped open instantly, no pop-ups, no viruses or malware. My Mother went through 4 PCs, and my brother 3 PCs, in the same time period that I owned my Mac. I sang praises to the mighty Mac! I was sold man. I was a Mac preacher! I spelled God like: M-A-C! My savior was Jesus Mac! (is that enough biblical reference?) On the other side of the coin I saw how everyone was going through all of these trials a tribulations with Vista and then Windows 10, they made it perfectly clear that PCs were JUNK! Flashback, flashback, “deedle-deet, deedle-deet, deedle-deet…”

I had had pc's before. I had an Intel 286 man! with a 12 Mhz processor! Yeah I said 12, not 12k or 12 to the tenth power, but just 12, you know, the one after 11 and before 13? This is the same computer that Adam and Eve used! (ok, no more!) So, my point being; I know about PCs I was there from the beginning. We used DOS commands because windows was still in it’s developmental infancy and was too slow. My programming instructor had a bumper sticker that said, “Real men don’t use Windows.” So I used PCs for 15+ years until around 2,000, when my friend had a Mac and showed me Corel Draw. We had been drinking when we got home to his house and he showed me his new Mac and fell asleep. I started messing around with Corel draw vector graphics app. and marveling at this new intuitive and simple machine — I was hooked. Then I started doing layout for a newspaper on Mac and I became Mac Dude.

Fast forward to 2017 when I purchase an iMac which just looked incredible and every bit as cool as my Mac Desktop Tower. But wasn’t I surprised! Oh yeah, I was surprised how much this thing sucks. Let me draw up a little iMac suck list:

1. NO DISC DRIVE SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS. iMac sucks. 

I feel completely stupid for not realizing there was no disc drive. I didn’t even think to look. I mean even laptops have disc drives. So after I get over feeling stupid, I get pissed. I’ve been ripped off. Nowhere did it say iMacs don’t have a disc drive.

1. SEARCH AND HELP DO NOT WORK. THEY SUCK, SUCK, SUCK

I was completely baffled by the search capabilities of File Find, and the total ineptitude of Mac help or any of the help searches for system and/or native apps. They do not work like the old Mac and as a matter of fact they don’t seem to work properly at all. 

3) IMAC/Safari ARBITRARILY DECIDES WHEN IT WANTS TO OPEN A WEBSITE 

Between iMac, Safari, and Google something doesn’t jive when it comes to opening websites. Sometimes they pop right open like they should on a Mac, but sometimes—more often than not— it takes forever and some3times not at all just to open a damn website I paid $1700 for this piece of crap and I can’t believe it.

Long story short: I have my email and password, but I can no longer use Thunderbird. But I can still log in through the online interface.

Why? Because App-specific passwords increase security. Eh, right. So I still have access to all my emails ... but no longer through Thunderbird. So ... me having to read all my fucking emails with the slow overly-animated iCloud interface is more secure than reading them through a quick click. Right.

Naturally, you COULD create that app-specific password.

Yeah, too bad I don't remember my moronic ""security questions"" anymore that I set up about 10 years ago. 

My childhood friend? The street I grew up in? Easy, right? Except, it isn't. They expect me to know the answers I gave there letter by letter. Basically, like a password. 

Well, why the fuck didn't you just tell me to get a second fucking password, you fucking morons! How the fuck am I supposed to know whether I wrote ""Andy"" or ""Andreas"" or ""Andy B."" or ""Andy Bold"" back then? 

And of course there's no way I can just try it out because it always asks me to fill out two security questions at the same time.

Eventually ended up calling support, talking over an hour to this dude. Of course a total sheep who would just tell me it's for my own good basically ... fuck, bureaucracy as bad as government.

Eventually he did something for me ... after he verified my identity using my credit card and me reading a few of my mails to him (to prove I have access to them anyway) ... he did the phenomenal, incredible ... he sent me a password reset email.

And not just ANY password reset email. No. It was a 24-hour delayed password reset email that I have to answer to within 3 hours of receiving it. 

And I'm like ""Yo dude, are you sure this makes sense? I don't need a new password, I know my password. I need fucking access to my emails through Thunderbird""

And he's like ""Yo dude, this is the only thing I can do for you. I completely verified your identity and know you have access to your emails anyhow, but I can't just give you the permission to access your data now, so I have to send you this password reset email. I think it will reset everything and you can log right back in then""

Of course it did not arrive EXACTLY 24 hours later, so I just had to fucking watch my inbox. Luckily I got it right.

Anyway, surprise surprise, I reset the password and NOTHING changed. The password was never the problem in the first place.

Worst customer service and worst security policies on this fucking planet. Won't allow me to read my fucking emails through Thunderbird. Despite me being able to read them through iCloud. Despite verifying my identity.

I was too pissed and annoyed and frustrated to call them again, so I guess I'll just hope that the iCloud thing will keep functioning for a while until one day I'll surely be completely locked out of my 10 year old account, because I can't fucking do anything about it despite still having my password, email and verified identity.

[Nobody killed you say?, read this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/apple-picking-stolen-iphones_n_2818488.html)

What happens is Apple creates a lust for their products like no one has ever seen. Since dumb people fall for this it makes them a target for crime because there are other dummies that will buy the stolen goods.

Perhaps it's natural selection, I don't know. But a word to the wise, don't display your wealth lavishly as it makes others jealous and increases your chances that someone who knows how to act on that jealousy to do you or our property harm. If your walking around with a team of armed Navy SEALS then that's another matter, but most don't.

You wear a Apple watch, it's telling criminals there is a iPhone in your pocket and trust me, the security measures Apple put in their devices don't work in the real world.

Criminals all know how to use Faraday Cage Bags to block the signals while later another criminal roots the device for resale.

&lt;p&gt;Just tired of losing, I&amp;#39;ve been with Apple from day one and they are JUST FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They repeat their same stupid mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on Windows now and it&amp;#39;s so much more stable and consistent, I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about a OS upgrade until 2020. Unlike annual pain with OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m free of the Apple Stockholm Syndrome Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

The last two incidents occurring right on or about the ending of the 3 year AppleCare extended warranty which is what is occurring with the present 2011 models now.

[The 2008 Macbook Pro's with the nVidia](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2008/10/apple-nvidia-chips-to-blame-for-macbook-pro-video-problems/) graphics, [exactly 3 years from the 2011 MacBook Pro's with the current issues.](http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/181797/apple-ignores-calls-to-fix-2011-macbook-pro-failures-as-problem-grows) Remember ""3"" as it has a correlation with other Apple things, [like the expiration of AppleCare and when Apple starts slowing peoples machines down with bloated OS X upgrades.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MacSucks/comments/28docp/25_year_former_mac_user_says_apple_sucks_and_why/)

It's hard to tell exactly what the blame is but these are possible reasons.

1. [Intel CPU integrated graphics with the Broadwell Core M should have been released in 2011 sometime but Intel is having problems so it's been delayed and still hasn't been released.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/11/intel_core_m_broadwell_revealed/) With several times better performance, the Core M would replace dedicated GPU's in Mac's as it needs only one fan. Thus with AMD and Nvida being shut out of Mac's in the future, really have no desire to care about future business with Apple. Of course the GPU makers could be sued to pay for the costs incurred by negligence.

2. Apple makes their laptops with dedicated GPU's too thin, the fan speeds set too low and there is no easy user serviceable way to clean the cooling fins of accumulated dust, therefore overheating the machines which cause it the hottest portion, the GPU to conk out earlier than expected. This is Apple's fault for not innovating a cooling fin design that blows out dust instead of collects it. Doing so would prolong the useful life of the hardware and generate less of a hardware turnover (less profits for Apple). Which Apple only supports the operating system that comes on the machine for 3-4 years forcing one to upgrade to a later OS X version or not receive security updates. This is the case for Early and Late 2011 MacBook Pro's which came with 10.6 and 10.7 (soon to be retired next) respectively.

3. Apple releases a new OS X version every year, it slows down older hardware and possibly replaces drivers and adds other software bloat. This also occurs with Apple's BootCamp drivers (for Windows) from their website that includes other software, which by far are more CPU hogging that the just the hardware drivers version that is included on the 10.6 disk for the Early 2011 machines. Since 10.7+ it's all strictly downloads for any Apple software, thus allowing them to bloat things out of control. Using the newer updated BootCamp drivers + other software on my Mac caused the CPU temps to increase 50 F over the norm. Luckily with Windows it's possible to cause a lot of this bloatware to not run at startup.

4. [Too much thermal paste applied to the processors actually hinders proper heat transfer to the cooling system.](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9211839/Apple_s_new_MacBook_Pros_raise_quality_concerns)

Anyway there is definitely something going wrong with Apple as they have this problem now for the last three or so generations of MacBook Pro with dedicated GPU's. Apple's new MacBook Pros nearly all don't have dedicated GPU's anymore and using Intel's older processors thus resulting in a net loss of graphics performance over their previous gen models. [**They even have started in on the iMac's.**](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/07/1099-imac-review-lose-50-of-your-performance-to-save-18-of-the-money/)


[**If you review other evidence here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/MacSucks/comments/28docp/25_year_former_mac_user_says_apple_sucks_and_why/) It's possible that Apple is purposely causing the hardware to fail shortly after the 3 years to cause those people to buy new Macs.

Anyway while other computer makers wisely don't push the hardware envelope Apple does and incurs the risk involved, they charge a lot for their hardware so they should compensate customers accordingly for their losses.

Apple has learned the art of deception, what they have to do publicly they put up a front for what they really are doing privately. Under the disguise of ""deals"" they are discussing options and gathering information so here's what I really think the Tim Cook/IBM deal is really all about.

First off, one has to remember that Steve Jobs was primarily a entrepreneur, he started Apple and he created Pixar from the ashes of Lucas Film's animation division. He later SOLD Pixar to Disney when he took over the reigns again at Apple.

Steve Jobs primary objective was to satisfy the stockholders, to make them a profit even if that means selling portions or the entirety of Apple in order to arrive at that goal.

Certain changes started occurring to OS X right after Pixar was sold to Disney and Jobs became it's largest shareholder. OS X started to become more child-like in it's user interface appearance. It was a direction many became uncomfortable with in the Mac community. 

It might have been that Steve was simply trying to appeal his hardware better to the children/family market which he felt was the best purchasing candidate for his hardware. However I couldn't help feeling he was thinking of merging Apple and Disney, since he just sold them Pixar. In order to do that he needed to pump up the volume on the visuals that appeal to Disney's primary market, young rich families.

The Mac division at Apple has been a weight around their necks for quite some time, it only represents a tiny 6% of their total revenue, with much of anything iOS related is making Apple closer to 89% of their revenue now. Apple is first and foremost a phone company now, with legacy computer portions that are nothing but dead weight.

iOS devices are Apple's ""next big thing"" and quite frankly what I think the Tim Cook/IBM deal is also really about is asking them how did they manage to sell their IBM PC division to Lenovo, a Chinese firm and how to duplicate that success with Apple's Mac division and perhaps even the iPhone and iPad also.

Lenevo, and it's huge Chinese market, may be attracted to buy the Mac lines as their exclusive high end machines and for government uses as Windows 8 was outlawed recently. Apple has pretty much exhausted their primary American, European and Japanese markets and the Chinese, much like the Japanese did when their economy first started gaining steam, is to prefer using their own rather than a import.

Imported products often involve extra costs. For Apple hardware, most of it is made in FoxConn's Chinese factories anyway and then sold to the Chinese people with the profits going to Apple, a American company. Knowing the Chinese like I do, they certainly are not going to stand that for long. They want to learn about things long enough and then duplicate them cheaper, more effectively and pocket the most money for themselves. It comes from there being too many poor and starving people for too long to want to share with a rich nation such as the US.

The recent declaration of the iPhone being a threat to Chinese national security and Russia Teleco's no longer selling iPhones may be part of plans by these countries to want to take care of their own people and needs and not send so much of their money overseas.

So what will Apple do after selling their Mac and or iPhone/iPad divisions? What did IBM do when it left the PC market?

Apple, with their huge data centers may be looking into content distribution, rather than continuing peddling their going no-where hardware Mac lines.

Android phones are kicking the iPhones collective arse, it's only a matter of time before cheap effective $99 smartphones are the norm and charging $600 a phone will seem insane, so like the expensive Mac's, the iPhone too is also a doomed product.

Apple to pull a new product out of it's magic hat? Don't count on it, there is nowhere to go anymore. The iWatch can only be a assistant to a iPhone, it can't replace it because battery and processor technology etc., hasn't advanced enough to make it happen. The iWatch buys Apple time and that's all.

The new MacPro, non-expandable machine that can't run the worlds most popular operating system? The last of it's kind while video pro's move to Avid on PC's and for collectors.

Apple is doomed where it is now because visionary entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Walt Disney don't come around all that often to change the world.

Tim Cook knows it and likely why secretly he's picking IBM's brains.

There are still 10-13 year old PC towers that are still running today with Windows XP on them. Find a Mac that is 10-13 years old and still running a supported Mac OS version. You can't because Apple doesn't support their older hardware nor supports OS X versions older than 4 years old.

http://regmedia.co.uk/2014/03/14/statcounter_small.jpg

XP is going down only because Microsoft finally had to retire it and end support. The Win7 &amp; 8? is SUPPORTED on 32 bit hardware. Apple's PPC processors and 32 bit Intel were rapidly forgotten.

**Annual operating system upgrade hell**

A new OS X version UPGRADE gets released annually, with a maximum of around 4 years of support per version. Apple rolls new features and software bloat with each new OS X version which cripples most of their older/slower hardware. The upgrades are REPLACEMENTS of the entire operating system (not patches), with kernel, partition changes and firmware updates that are beyond most of their unsuspecting naive install base to handle when it breaks. If you don't upgrade, your denied security updates in 3 years. If you upgrade after 3 year AppleCare is expired or after your standard 1 year warranty, your paying out of pocket if it bricks. 

Most experienced Mac purchasers know to buy the most powerful hardware in the area they require, because Mac's are not upgradable and the annual OS X upgrade bloat slows them down.

The core software and hardware was designed to work perfectly together before a new machine goes to factory for production. Apple even touts this as a selling point why their platform is better, however it goes and screws all that up soon afterwards with substantial core/UI changes that interrupts people's lives, looses their data and slows down their hardware. For a platform that is supposedly more friendly to new computer users, it's just not the case.

**Microsoft announces support cycles. Apple doesn't, ambushes users**

3 year old OS X 10.6 is currently UNSUPPORTED by Apple, makes up ~20% of OS X users [per Net Applications](http://www.netmarketshare.com/) where all OS X versions combined is only 6.5% total market share [**Apple refuses support, 1 in 5 Mac's vulnerable**](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9246609/Apple_retires_Snow_Leopard_from_support_leaves_1_in_5_Macs_vulnerable_to_attacks)

Apple really screwed OS X 10.6 users who upgraded to 10.7, didn't warn them during the install process that 10.7 had no Rosetta compatibility for their PPC processor based software. Hundreds of thousands of people were asking support how to revert their machines back to OS X 10.6, dragging their machines into Apple, because they needed their software to work LIKE RIGHT NOW!

The annual OS X upgrades tend to break your third party software and hardware drivers, many have to pay for software upgrades and/or buy newer hardware as some makers won't supply drivers for their older hardware despite them still working fine.

Almost every OS X version one upgrades their Mac annually to robs the machine of performance. Many newer Mac's now come with non-upgradable RAM, so the machines performance can't be increased to counter the software bloat.

[Even the neutral exFAT format Disk Utility does can't be hardly read on Windows.](http://www.mactip.net/guide-how-to-format-an-external-drive-to-work-seamlessly-with-macs-and-pcs-without-third-party-software/)

Problem was fixed for OS X 10.7+ but not for the 20% on 10.6, see what I mean now about Apple? 2011 was a mere 3 years ago, 10.6 was being sold on NEW machines back then. Apple just forgets you exist after 3 years and hopes you upgrade your machine or gets malware so it breaks and you can then be sold a new one.

**Higher than normal hardware turnover rate, hardware obsolescence built in**

I've replaced my primary Mac computer 4 times and the operating system **9** times in the same 13 year period my $1000 Dell Pentium XP tower (+ $500 for monitors/keyboard/mice) using friend has had his.

1. eMac - died 3 years/obsolete due to operating system version, clogged with dust (can't clean them) ~$1,000.

2. PowerMac G5 - made obsolete in ~3 years because Apple didn't release a OS X 10.6 version for PPC processors, otherwise it being a tower with replaceable parts, can clean the dust out, SHOULD HAVE lasted 10 years. ~$6,000 with 30"" displays w/AppleCare.

3. 15"" MBP - died 3.5 years due to cooling fin clogging as Apple had no process in place to inform users to clean or provide cleaning to prevent overheating. Won't let user self clean the cooling fins without violating AppleCare. Also the keyboard on their laptops is weak cheap crap. ~$2500 w/AppleCare

4. 17"" MBP - (2011) **EDIT** Despite using the best of care, cleaning the dust out annually, using external devices for input, raising the hind legs a little to make sure there is adequate airflow under the machine. The 2011 machine just recently died on Black Friday 2014, 3 years 8 months from purchase. The cause was a failed dedicated GPU like many Mac users are reporting due to over-application of thermal paste. (see below)  ~$3500 w/AppleCare.

My XP friend has had a much more reliable computer at a much lower price for far longer with less trouble than I had with Apple. XP might have gotten malware, Win 7+ hardly does. Apple is a hardware company using software (and planned hardware obsolescence) to force rapid turnover. High Price &lt;&gt; Quality or Longevity.

People are being sold on the looks and the fad status, ""Look at me, I'm fabulous, I've got a fashion product"". Apple's hardware isn't any better than others, it would be if there wasn't so much dust clogging planned obsolescence built in, annual OS X upgrade bloat crippling performance.

Mac users typically make up dozens of reasons/excuses why it's better, but no clear reasons why the world far and wide has rejected their platform. Every year when Apple changes up OS X, hardware or software (like FCPX) there is yet another huge outcry on the Apple forums.

Windows is more calm, consistent and stable, security updates come out fast and not three months to 3 years later like with Apple. Microsoft may be wrong at times, but it corrects itself to market forces and doesn't ignore older hardware. Apple forces you to do things their way EVERY FRIGGING YEAR and uses updates/upgrades to slow down your machine, trap your files into only their formats and backups. No TimeMachine for Windows!

Apple just forgets you exist after 3 years and hopes you upgrade your machine or gets malware so it breaks and you can then be sold a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19364""&gt;Microsoft gave a free exFAT download to all Windows XP users, a 12 year old operating system.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher than normal hardware turnover rate, hardware obsolescence built in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve replaced my primary Mac computer 4 times and the operating system &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; times in the same 13 year period my $1000 Dell Pentium XP tower (+ $500 for monitors/keyboard/mice) using friend has had his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;eMac - died 3 years/obsolete due to operating system version, clogged with dust (can&amp;#39;t clean them) ~$1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerMac G5 - made obsolete in ~3 years because Apple didn&amp;#39;t release a OS X 10.6 version for PPC processors, otherwise it being a tower with replaceable parts, can clean the dust out, SHOULD HAVE lasted 10 years. ~$6,000 with 30&amp;quot; displays w/AppleCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;15&amp;quot; MBP - died 3.5 years due to cooling fin clogging as Apple had no process in place to inform users to clean or provide cleaning to prevent overheating. Won&amp;#39;t let user self clean the cooling fins without violating AppleCare. Also the keyboard on their laptops is weak cheap crap. ~$2500 w/AppleCare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;17&amp;quot; MBP - (2011) &lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Despite using the best of care, cleaning the dust out annually, using external devices for input, raising the hind legs a little to make sure there is adequate airflow under the machine. The 2011 machine just recently died on Black Friday 2014, 3 years 8 months from purchase. The cause was a failed dedicated GPU like many Mac users are reporting due to over-application of thermal paste. (see below)  ~$3500 w/AppleCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My XP friend has had a much more reliable computer at a much lower price for far longer with less trouble than I had with Apple. XP might have gotten malware, Win 7+ hardly does. Apple is a hardware company using software (and planned hardware obsolescence) to force rapid turnover. High Price &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Quality or Longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html""&gt;For instance Intel HD graphics are substantially behind their dedicated graphics cousins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using OS X/iOS upgrades to cripple hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs, the founder, got kicked out of Apple by the CEO John Sculley he himself hired from PepsiCo. After many years of exile, and after several ineffective CEO&amp;#39;s of Apple, this is the Steve Jobs sales pitch to get rehired as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;If I were running Apple, I would milk the Macintosh for all it&amp;#39;s worth — and get busy on the next great thing. The PC wars are over. Done. Microsoft won a long time ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;- Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/steve-jobs-proclaims-the-post-pc-era-has-arrived/""&gt;Jobs declared his Mac&amp;#39;s dead, says &amp;quot;we lost&amp;quot; to Microsoft, trying to shift users to iPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milking extended to Apple&amp;#39;s iOS product line as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/04/apple-ipad-software-update""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You mean my two-year-old iPad can&amp;#39;t take this year&amp;#39;s software?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53289ae5ecad047b21ed92ff-1200-900/2014_03_12_profit.jpg""&gt;The Mac only makes up 6% of Apple&amp;#39;s current revenue&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad 10% and the iPhone a whopping 68%! Why? &lt;a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/apple-new-iphones_n_5967626.html""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because they can cause  a 2 year hardware turnover rate by slowing your device down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.tech-thoughts.net/2013/05/global-smartphone-market-share-trends-android-iphone-windows-phone.html""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone global market share trending downwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can&amp;#39;t self-remove the storage with sensitive files if the machine won&amp;#39;t boot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filevault passwords have to given up to get the machine repaired. With &amp;quot;Fusion Drive&amp;quot; (aka hybrid) the SSD portion is on the logicboard. SSD&amp;#39;s and flash drives can&amp;#39;t be securely erased (unlike hard drives can). NSA says grind or melt them. Nice huh?  &lt;a href=""http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/02/17/1911217/confidential-data-not-safe-on-solid-state-disks""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Data Not Safe on Solid State Disks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing/crippling hardware/software lines as they exit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xserver gone. XRAID gone. 17&amp;quot; MacBook Pro gone. MacBooks gone. &lt;a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/07/1099-imac-review-lose-50-of-your-performance-to-save-18-of-the-money/""&gt;Hobbling hardware performance.&lt;/a&gt; Anti-glare screens gone too, &lt;a href=""http://macmatte.wordpress.com/""&gt;to the dismay of many.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/latest-gadgets/content/apples-final-cut-pro-x-leaves-many-pro-video-editors-disappointed-and-angry""&gt;Apple released that abortion of Final Cut Pro X that had Hollywood screaming&lt;/a&gt; and many running to &lt;a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/01/more-fcpx-fallout-top-reality-producer-ditches-apple-for-avid/""&gt;Avid on HP Workstations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2832566""&gt;Windows Pro versions have downgrade rights to the previous versions, not Mac&amp;#39;s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/apple-to-cease-development-support-of-pro-photo-app-aperture/""&gt;Apple announces end of Aperture, their Pro level photo editing program.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is constantly changing interfaces, requiring a slew of adapters to get everything to work and then it doesn&amp;#39;t work well or long as they just drop hardware lines. Go in to get a replacement monitor for a three year old machine, it&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple employs a severe expensive hardware and software &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome""&gt;Stockholm Syndrome Effect&lt;/a&gt; with their annual change up that is unlike anything seen on Windows.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general attitude in Apple Stores is if you can&amp;#39;t/won&amp;#39;t replace your iOS device every two years and your Mac every three years, it&amp;#39;s all your fault. They don&amp;#39;t care how they treat you because they got a brainwashed fools right behind you they haven&amp;#39;t burned yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are being sold on the looks and the fad status, &amp;quot;Look at me, I&amp;#39;m fabulous, I&amp;#39;ve got a fashion product&amp;quot;. Apple&amp;#39;s hardware isn&amp;#39;t any better than others, it would be if there wasn&amp;#39;t so much dust clogging planned obsolescence built in, annual OS X upgrade bloat crippling performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac users typically make up dozens of reasons/excuses why it&amp;#39;s better, but no clear reasons why the world far and wide has rejected their platform. Every year when Apple changes up OS X, hardware or software (like FCPX) there is yet another huge outcry on the Apple forums.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2ds12q/apple_ignores_calls_to_fix_2011_macbook_pro/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple dupes people into buying quality and doesn&amp;#39;t deliver. See what Reddit says!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac users have to run Windows and keep their skills up as 99% of the business world uses it. The software selection on OS X is poor, it&amp;#39;s expensive because of the lack of competition, due to the decreasing market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat fellow human beings like dirt. Forced U2 download anyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFisher""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Took 3 years to fix a active iTunes exploit they knew about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=""http://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;used by suppressive regimes all over the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple product crime spree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5946321/apple-products-account-for-14-percent-of-all-crime-in-new-york-city""&gt;Apple responsible for 14% of NYC crime&lt;/a&gt; Jealous people pour liquid into Mac&amp;#39;s keyboard or try walk off with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripping iOS devices out of people&amp;#39;s hands is common. &lt;a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/apple-picking-stolen-iphones_n_2818488.html""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police warn people to not to use their Apple devices in the open.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.thesafemac.com/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mac&amp;#39;s have been getting malware.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#39;s rather easy since 20% of the platform is unsupported for security updates and that&amp;#39;s only going to increase when 10.10 is released and 10.7 is ignored. &lt;a href=""http://www.theweek.co.uk/technology/46205/flashback-trojan-infects-apple-macs-cupertino""&gt;Apple never learned, 500,000 Macs and HQ pwned.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows is more calm, consistent and stable, security updates come out fast and not three months to 3 years later like with Apple. Microsoft may be wrong at times, but it corrects itself to market forces and doesn&amp;#39;t ignore older hardware. Apple forces you to do things their way EVERY FRIGGING YEAR and uses updates/upgrades to slow down your machine, trap your files into only their formats and backups. No TimeMachine for Windows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/steve-jobs-wanted-to-further-lock-customers-into-apples-ecosystem/""&gt;&amp;quot;Tie all of our products together, so we further lock customers into our ecosystem,&amp;quot; - Steve Jobs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Windows PC&amp;#39;s one has a choice of hardware vendors. Mac&amp;#39;s have a very limited hardware line and have been removing products as they switch to the more profitable and rapidly disposable iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was supportive of the underdog Apple for LONG TIME (since the Apple IIe) but finally just had enough of the &amp;quot;New Apple&amp;quot; abuse, the built in planned obsolescence, the constant mistreatment and manipulation of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying into Apple is buying into a problem, it&amp;#39;s not buying to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please, pass this far and wide and let others know the truth about Apple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
