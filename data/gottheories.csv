Hello,

I would like to begin by saying that this is just an interesting theory that I came up with, and that I do not have hard evidence proving it, but there is some circumstantial evidence to back up my thoughts. That being said, I think that it is possible that Disney entered into a conspiracy with show-runners David Benioff and D.B Weiss (from hence referred to as D&amp;D) to intentionally tank the final season of Game of Thrones. I know that this seems pretty crazy, but hear me out.

First, I believe that the vast majority of Game of Thrones fans are at the very least perplexed by the final season of the show. Its ridiculous writing rendering whole story arcs pointless, unsatisfying, and illogical could be chalked up to incompetence, but then combined with the shortened season it starts to seem intentional. We know that it was D&amp;D who decided to do the shortened season despite the wishes of HBO and George R.R. Martin because George R.R. Martin says so in this quick interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2jSrbiTjhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2jSrbiTjhs) . So D&amp;D, having control over the questionable writing, and being responsible for the shortening of a season that just had way too much left in the story, can legitimately be blamed for the last season's massive drop in ratings.

So now that the blame can be put squarely on D&amp;D, we look at the motive. Why in the world would they fail so spectacularly? That's where Disney comes in. Back in September of 2017 Disney announced that they were going to launch their own streaming service, and it is set to roll out in November of this year, as seen in this article "" [https://www.digitaltrends.com/business/disney-plus-streaming-service-news/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/business/disney-plus-streaming-service-news/) "". Disney owning Marvel, Star Wars, and their impending acquisition of much of Fox's content gives Disney a massive advantage as they will have the sole rights to make new shows and movies out of these characters and stories for their new streaming service. We can already see that they are pulling back now on Netflix forcing them to end or cancel their popular marvel shows like Jessica Jones, Daredevil, etc. Game of Thrones is one of the few massively popular pieces of intellectual property that Disney does not own, and worse it is owned by one of their chief competitors in the streaming business, HBO.

Let's follow the timeline, September, 2017 Disney announces its streaming service. Then according to its wikipedia page Game of Thrones season 8 starting filming just the very next month October, 2017 and doesn't finish until July, 2018 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_of\_Thrones\_(season\_8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(season_8)) . It is announced February, 2018 that D&amp;D will be writing and producing a new series of Star Wars films [https://www.cnet.com/news/star-wars-films-game-of-thrones-creators/](https://www.cnet.com/news/star-wars-films-game-of-thrones-creators/) . We are talking about a massive deal for them worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the announcement releases less than half way through the filming of the last season of Game of Thrones. These kinds of deals don't happen over night either, so you know that they were meeting with Disney discussing this potential deal months before the public announcement.

I find it very suspicious that sometime either before or right at the start of the filming of the last season of Game of Thrones, D&amp;D get approached by Disney with the deal of a lifetime to write and produce their own **SERIES** of Star Wars movies. The proceeding season then proves to be such a bust that it becomes a massive internet joke, and forces a premature book-end to a story that was a **HUGE** draw for HBO in May, 2019, a mere 6 months before Disney's streaming service launch.

Again, I recognize that I only have some circumstantial evidence to back up this theory, but I was just surprised that I had not seen anyone else talking about how the show-runners, who did an unbelievably terrible job on the last season of Game of Thrones, were given an extremely lucrative deal from a company that was planning on starting a competitive streaming service, right around the time that blunder of a season was made.

Bronn scene replaced with this: Citadel with it's maesters is in a crisis mode, trying to figure out what can be done with white walkers, if anything.

Changes starting from s8, end of episode 2:

In Winterfell everyone has dragonglass amulet / jewelry on skin.

Dany's conversation gets interrupted by something. A dragon sees or senses the ice dragon and telephatically tells dany. This confirms that the telepathy is birectional. Dany runs from the room trying to warn. Then outside one guard spots it too and gives alarm. Normal dragons take off on their own initiative to attack the ice dragon. Conversations in many rooms get interrupted, but not much can be done before some roofs are on fire and people escape barely. Attack was weak and hasty because of need to avoid Dany's dragons. Ice dragon gets pursued but soon the pursuit is given up and normal dragons fly back. Those roofs that catched fire, burn to sunrise, giving illumination.

Indoors, next to a map, Jorah is the overall commander with Jaime's help. Bran sits on a corner giving information. Sam handles raven messages. 

Missandei runs around interpreting between northmen and others.

Castle is packed with troops and civilians. 

Strongest fences &amp; trenches and most troops outside castle face north, but some are surrounding on all sides because it is not clear from where the attack comes. Civilians that can run but not fight had the option to stay outside of castle in it's south side, preparing to run away if that starts to feel the safest option and it is known which way is away from WWs.

Ground attack starts. Everyone swallows a small, smooth, round pill of dragonglass. Wights try to go around main formations to reach the castle wall. Some catapults and their ammo is set on fire before wights reach them, while others continue to sling fire on wights. Cavalry attacks wight groups from sides and back, mostly using bow and arrow, before retreating temporarily. Cavalry has dragon glass axes or spears on hand. Groups have a mix of weapons. 

Night king had arranged wights on units based on their speed: Some can only walk, most can go jogging speed, some can run faster than most people.

Dany and Jon do air to ground attacks together, guided by fire signals ordered by Jorah.

Then a snowstorm starts. With it comes NK riding the ice dragon, killing lots of troops and civilians outside the castle. NK lands, raises hands, expecting dead to rise, but few rise and those that rise just stumble around. All the dragon glass amulets and pills have worked. Crypts get some extra noise, but stone containers are strong enough.

Then gradually confusion rises because there seems to be no attack anymore. Jorah and Jaime try to get answers about enemy locations, but no one knows anything. Snowstorm stops. Crypts go silent. Jorah says ""I guess we won"" and removes all wight markers from the map. 

Sun rises. Bran says he located some wights walking away. Dany and Jon go do a reconnaissance flight there and find most of the wight army marching south. Night king aborted the mission with Winterfell and tries to get easier targets.

Most main characters did not encounter any wights.

Then people have extra long sleep. 

Next day they decide to pursue the wight army before it gets stronger. There are questions about the wounded and deserters, which are addressed by those who stay behind.

During next weeks, wights get attacked with cavalry and dragons. Wights try to move and hide in forests, dispersed, which slows them, but makes air attacks less effective.

Credible word about WWs spreads around Westeros and Essos. Cersei arranges dragon glass axes and spears for Lannister forces, dragon glass pills for population and jewelry for herself.

Cersei orders troops to positions / areas that as a strategy is directed equally against Dany and wights. She orders to shoot any dragon. But Jaime goes to lannister forces and convinces the generals to disobey and hold fire if they see Dany's dragons.

...

Eventually night king gets to King's landing, which gets mostly evacuated. Ice dragon kills fleeing civilians. Night king enters Red keep and finds Cersei in her office. Cersei is terrified. Night king feels Cersei's belly with his hand and smiles. A candle is burning on Cersei's table. Cersei tips over the candle, igniting a trail of wildfire leading to barrels full of it. Cersei's office blows up. Dany sees the explosion while on a dragon far away and seconds later also hears. Euron hears it on a ship few second later, after the sound arrived (340 meters per second) and turns to see a rising cloud. But night king gets only wounded.

Meanwhile, maesters of Citadel, Melisandre and Qyburn have invented a poison that kills white walkers when splashed on them. One drop can kill, but it takes time with such low amount.

Meanwhile, delegation from Essos visits Winterfell.

There is epic boss fight between night king and a dragon after that dragon tried to drop some poison on NK but missed. Dragon kicks night king mortally.

As night king is dying, Missandei runs to him and tries to speak in every language she knows. Missandei slaps NK and asks, ""what were you thinking, why did you attack South?""  NK answers. 

At some point Jon introduces his dog Ghost to dragons. Ghost likes flying on a dragon with Jon. 

At some point Tyrion invents a saddle and safety harness for riding dragons. 

Daenerys becomes queen of 8 kingdoms. Tormund is placed as warden of beyond the wall and Jon as warden of the north. Sansa is Jon's deputy / vice warden. Jon marries a wildling. Sansa has various men. Bran moves to King's landing and becomes advisor to master of whispers Varys. 

Mayor of some cities get voted by limited elections.

Night's watch is replaced with coast guard which mostly means people sitting on remote beaches watching sea in case something from west of westeros invades. They also investigate reports of strange sightings. 

Sam starts a project to estimate radius of the planet and also distance to the moon by using precise ground measurements of angles and distances. It involves calculating curvature on parts of Westeros.

Dany marries Podrick Payne.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One change for s8e1:&lt;/p&gt;

P.S. before 29th July

I will not be responding to messages and comments until July 28th. 
The issue is not with people disbelieving or downvoting (that's anyways expected), but the toxicity and thorough inappropriateness in some comments and personal messages don't deserve my mind space or indeed anything more than the slap of time's own heavy hand. 

Sincere apologies to many of you who want to engage productively and are not hearing back from me for the next 7 weeks. I have tried to write out just *some* of the threads here (https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bt4foy/the_greatest_media_experiment_pulled_off_by_hbo/eqnqae0?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) -- however *please understand that there is much more*. You are free to agree or disagree and I strongly advocate a healthy dose of skepticism to everything in life. However, at present, I feel drained and just don't have more time, energy (or willingness) to debate or defend things before everyone is on the same page. I'd love for everyone (including myself) to experience the reveals as the creators meant for it to be revealed and I will be happy to come back and re-engage in a healthy dialog about it all after the break. 
Please excuse me till then.

Meanwhile - For what it's worth, I'd recommend everyone to take a breather and watch something else for a while. For those seeking recommendations of other short-duration interesting things to watch - I recommend Chernobyl, The Night Of, and BodyGuard. 

Thank you and see you in a few weeks.

TL;DR *Save up some time and money for the therapy that'll be required after the last six/seven episodes start airing in 7 weeks from now. (The trailer/run-up announcement could drop post Big Little Lies Premiere or post the Big Little Lies Finale)*


I'm a Thrones watcher on the wall who has gone through different stages of drama in the last month and wanted to drop a final word of caution to all who will inevitably follow my unworthy footsteps..¬†

Post episode 3 this season was when my disappointment and shock was at its worst. I was disillusioned and bitter af, talking myself hoarse (not online, but to any good friend who would listen) over how shitty the treatment had been to the storywriting in favor of the visuals.¬†

Post episode 4, I was more than a little confused. I could see where it was going, but the pacing was killing me. It felt like a dragged out injustice to a story I'd loved so much. I started making a list of things I would never find an answer to.¬†And see if I could find the answers in some past clips myself. 


By the time episode 5 hit, my researched theories went from 2 to 5 solid ones.... I thought I'd mostly got the gist. Yes, Dany's character progression was OK, and rushed and half-assed for a reason. This could still work. Some last episode reveals (that have already been foreshadowd or indicated)¬†could still explain Dany, NK arc and the 3ER and some main things from the kingdoms.¬†


By the time Episode 6 started, I was yet heartbroken for Jaime - but ready with my list of 5 explanations that could save this still. Tbh, from the get-go of that episode, I was just waiting for Jon to kill Dany and get a move on to the final 20-30 minutes for the bait and switch (Usual Suspects style).¬†


Then Episode 6 happened, and it made absolutely zero sense as I was watching each frame. Scene by scene references of LOTR and Star Wars, enough nonsense continuity errors to fill a dissertation, absurd dialogs, deliberate jokes,¬†cut to blacks, and what not...¬†
By the time it wrapped, I was already expecting a surprise Next Week trailer. My biggest shock that day, very honestly, was seeing the credits roll without that surprise trailer.

I will admit here that (unlike 99% of the watchers who cursed and gave up), not for a single second after the credits rolled on that finale did I believe that it was done. There was way more left ready to reveal. There had to be more air time. 

The more I thought about it, the more it was clear that entire finale episode was a joke/a dream.¬†Not because some of those things won't happen. It will. But not with that treatment. 


So I started believing this was a deliberate suspense move by HBO and the documentary would be the actual finale - episode 7. Meanwhile, my list of important things that could be explained basis existing evidence (ie previous proven connections) grew from 5 to 10. It was beginning to come together quite nicely in big pieces.¬†

My confidence wouldn't waver an inch because the evidence in the show was staring me in the face. Deliberate Easter egg scenes and dialogs from even the penultimate episode of this season. You don't shoot those if you don't intend to do something with it. Plus some of the songs from that Spotify list started falling perfectly in place as too.¬†


My only hesitation - Even those few things I had worked out would take at least 2-3 episodes. So I wasn't sure how this would work out. I went back and rewatched the last episode one more time. One line jumped out at me. *Ask me again in 10 years*


Given the entire episode seemed to be a mock comedy of sorts, taunting theories, asking vociferous critics and theorists to ""please sit"" etc.... I wondered what that line was specifically about. Initially I surmised that it meant 10 episodes. 4 more episodes sounded like enough room for all the arcs I'd caught to close gracefully.¬†


So when the documentary revealed nothing further beyond an interesting sign off line - *what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger* - I thought OK, this is happening, but I've got the dates wrong. Let's wait for 2nd June. 

But again, nothing.¬†

And now another big $$ star cast show Big Little Lies was starting from 9th on Sundays @9. Hmmm.¬†


So where do our pending episodes go?¬†

*Ask me again in 10 years*


10 weeks from May 19th' s episode (8x06)... July 28th is the first Sunday after HBO wraps Big Little Lies Season 2.


More than a few mentions have been made (with HBO's blessings) of the ""cross over"" of the two shows. I guess weaving an entire show season between two halves of another could be seen as quite a literal ""cross over"".¬†


Aidan's cryptic line in an an old interview about taking a break halfway through the season also falls in place. If we are indeed halfway through. That would brings us 6 more episodes.¬†


Whoa. This would be epic.¬†


*Reader, I can't stress this enough, that's where I should've just stopped.*


In the thirst to get to the bottom of it and confirm my theories a final time before any of the other episodes were officially announced or started airing - I started again from scratch. And somewhere along that watch, I finally realized what the hell was going on scene after scene.¬†


Much like the Red Keep, the whole world came crashing. To the point that I had to actively stop and put it away  for my own sake.¬†


You'll think you have it, but nope, you're all grasping at a bunch of different needles each in a giant ass needlestack (there's very little hay) üëª.¬†


I've reached that last frontier where I finally understand what Gwendoline Christie meant by us needing therapy and I couldn't agree more. (https://youtu.be/odf4G-WDw2k) 

There hasn't been anything like this in the history of writing or screenplay or direction. I doubt there ever will be. Prepare to be assaulted from all directions and be made to question *everything*, right up to your very existence.¬†

If there's one line that'll define Game of Thrones for posterity... It'll be ""You know nothing, Jon Snow""¬†


If and when you finally recover from the unabated assault of shock and awe, and start your watch again, prepare to be blown away by the writing, screenplay and direction of each and every scene... Even those oft criticized as shallow and inconsistent. 

There is but one story. From the first frame to the last. When the dots connect, *every single scene* from the last 10 years will connect in one fell swoop. I'm beginning to now honestly doubt if GOT has ever had a single filler scene. It's just non stop brilliance.¬†

It doesn't matter what kinda end you were expecting - happy, sad or otherwise - you just haven't paid enough attention.¬†

This will soon be a journey most of us will remember for a lifetime and I daresay it will fundamentally change world views of those who will embrace the story for all that it brings to the senses. I'm very numb right now but I think we will be experiencing emotions from every effing inch of the spectrum in the weeks to come. I bend the knee till perpetuity to GRRM, David, Dan and all the directors that pulled this off. 


Anyway, excuse the (much warranted) extra dramatic warning. You'll get it when you get it. But the point is this - resign to your wait, and prepare for something therapeutic. You're NOT ready and no level of preparation will be enough. üò±","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last update : The date to look out for an announcement is July 30, 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----*******----&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. before 29th July&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not be responding to messages and comments until July 28th. 
The issue is not with people disbelieving or downvoting (that&amp;#39;s anyways expected), but the toxicity and thorough inappropriateness in some comments and personal messages don&amp;#39;t deserve my mind space or indeed anything more than the slap of time&amp;#39;s own heavy hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere apologies to many of you who want to engage productively and are not hearing back from me for the next 7 weeks. I have tried to write out just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the threads here (&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bt4foy/the_greatest_media_experiment_pulled_off_by_hbo/eqnqae0?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bt4foy/the_greatest_media_experiment_pulled_off_by_hbo/eqnqae0?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&lt;/a&gt;) -- however &lt;em&gt;please understand that there is much more&lt;/em&gt;. You are free to agree or disagree and I strongly advocate a healthy dose of skepticism to everything in life. However, at present, I feel drained and just don&amp;#39;t have more time, energy (or willingness) to debate or defend things before everyone is on the same page. I&amp;#39;d love for everyone (including myself) to experience the reveals as the creators meant for it to be revealed and I will be happy to come back and re-engage in a healthy dialog about it all after the break. 
Please excuse me till then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile - For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I&amp;#39;d recommend everyone to take a breather and watch something else for a while. For those seeking recommendations of other short-duration interesting things to watch - I recommend Chernobyl, The Night Of, and BodyGuard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and see you in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR &lt;em&gt;Save up some time and money for the therapy that&amp;#39;ll be required after the last six/seven episodes start airing in 7 weeks from now. (The trailer/run-up announcement could drop post Big Little Lies Premiere or post the Big Little Lies Finale)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The book has talked about Tywin's plans for marrying Lysa and Jaime. I just can't recall if the show has. 
Or *any other* arranged marriage proposal for Jaime, ie.

And it's kinda important.   

Mostly the theory needs evidence that Jaime has an arranged marriage connection in this respect (Lysa would work best). But if there's anyone else referred to in the same context, that would be interesting to know as well.

-----********-----

P. S. Added later to outline the theory and thinking! 

OK - I'm putting the sketch outline here if that helps people help me better. 

*This is just a theory - it could be right and it could be completely wrong. Also, yes I'm using show evidence when most all of you think the show is over. But, let's say we agree to disagree on that fact. Let's say the show is NOT over. Amuse my whim and help me test this for evidence to see if it stands as a possibility.*

---

*Potential Spoilers* 

Magi's prophecy to Cersei was that she will have 3 children. ""Gold their crowns and gold their shrouds."" 
From the outset we've believed this means Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen coz of their gold hair and then their gold shrouds in death have helped confirm this. 

But in both the show and the books, Cersei had conceived a child by Robert as well. Show talked about the boy supposedly dying in fever. Books talked about Cersei killing the baby with moon tea (I have reasons to doubt this given other character evidence) 

So *what if* their child lived? Several hints laid out that this boy is Gendry. Gendry's yellow haired mother. Arryn's ""Seed is strong"". Camera transitions to blacksmiths in the scene after Cersei talks about the son she lost... 

Throws off the prophecy a bit (in fact the prophecy fails per the show even if the boy died young) . 
He is already Cersei's fourth child and also black haired. 

---

But can I still make it fit another way? 

Yes, if I revisit the Magi's words and note carefully that she clearly uses the word gold ""crowns"". Joffrey and Tommen have worn the crown. But Myrcella has not. She was a princess, but never a queen. So Gendry can still be the third gold crown and shroud as the rightful heir of the throne, who then also gets the royal shroud as and when he dies(?) 

This is working so far. 

But then Myrcella needs to be not Cersei's own. How can that work? Myrcella is 8 at the time the story starts... ie she was born around the Greyjoy Rebellion years. What if Cersei took her as a daughter but she was of another womb? 

---

The show has some very leading lines to indicate this possibility. 

A. Just before Myrcella is going to die... Jaime tries to explain something to Myrcella about her past. 
(*I was actually quite surprised and curious by the timing of this sudden decision on Jaime's part - why is he telling Myrcella abt him and Cersei all of a sudden? Have the twins  discussed revealing the secret to Tommen/Myrcella? Surely Jaime won't decide alone to reveal that secret to Myrcella AND DO IT WHEN CERSEI IS NOT AROUND?*) 

So *as I wonder about the timing and choice of doing this conversation in Cersei's absence*, Jaime talks of arranged marriages never being a sure thing, and things of love being outside our control. He is interrupted by Myrcella saying she understands - towhit he responds ""*No, I don't think you do*"" .... But then Myrcella kind of hijacks the conversation - says she has kind of always known, is glad to have Jaime as her father, Jaime looks absolutely stunned(?) and Myrcella dies in his arms. 

B. When Myrcella's body arrives, Cersei is broken - she talks about Myrcella being so pure and unlike herself. She say - ""From her first breath she was good... *I don't know where she came from*, but I felt if I could make her such a wonderful person, maybe I'm not a monster"". 

Jaime says ""She was MY daughter. I failed to protect her"" 

------

This is exactly the kind of choice words the show (and Martin) uses to lay out clues. 

------

It fits this far, but now the problems start lining up... 

- Jaime ""claims"" to Cersei that he is Myrcella's father. 
- Yet Jaime has also said to Catelyn that he has never ""been with"" anyone but Cersei and that makes him more honorable than Ned in a way. It's a big deal if this is actually untrue. 
- Myrcella definitely is at least part Lannister. 

Some loose threads that may or may not add up - 

- Lysa Tully was Jaime's intended in the books (apparently no mention in the show) 
- Lysa had several ""miscarriages"" in the capital during the time of Myrcella's supposed birth (before Robin was born. And I doubt Robin was Jon Arryn's son either) 
- Catelyn Tully was in the capital at the time Myrcella is supposed to have been born. I believe she had Arya in 289 AC and Bran in 290 AC. 
- Catelyn has a fraught relationship with Jaime (to me it feels somewhat duality laden) from the moment they meet after his capture post the Whispering Woods. 
- Lot of intense word exchanges between the two where Jaime talks of oaths, bastards, honor, etc. 
- Catelyn loathes Jaime, but also is instrumental in setting him free. 

-----******-----

Edit : Added 28 hours after original post. 

Currently I'm left with 3 possibilities for this one to work, then... 

1. That Myrcella is Jaime's biological daughter with another woman. (Makes a dent on Jaime's reputation as having forever been with Cersei) 


2. That Myrcella is not Jaime's biological daughter but he takes responsibility of her since she was born to an earlier intended partner he somewhat cared about. Perhaps the intended could not keep Myrcella - so Jaime accepted as his own. (But this is not backed by any specific show scene / dialog and we would still need a biological Lannister connection) 


3. That Myrcella is not Jaime's biological daughter, but he takes responsibility of her since she was born to someone he cared about. Not necesarily a woman. 

---

Annnnddd with #3... Suddenly there's a feeble light at the end of the tunnel on timeline and show hints that back the theory. 

*Tyrion*! In 289 AC, Tyrion is 16, and guess who he fell in love with and married at 16? Tysha! Tyrion-Tysha are a big deal in the show and the books. 

It was a love that would've been ""outside control"" - it doesn't fall into the arranged marriage conversation but it falls into exactly what Jaime says to Myrcella immediately consequent to that... About us not choosing the people we love. 

Would it not be like Jaime to foster a child born to Tysha if it was Tyrion's blood? Tyrion didn't know Tysha's fate after everything that went down... But Jaime would've protected their child as his own daughter, perhaps even tell Cersei that the child was his own, like Ned did with Catelyn? Only Cersei accepted and loved the child like a mother (while Catelyn couldn't bring herself to ever love Jon)...

-------

Some of Cersei's lines stand out ever so prominently in this light, highlighting just how devoted she was in loving a child that wasn't hers...

""*I fed her at my breast even though they asked me to give her to the wetnurse*"" 

""*She was my only daughter*"" 

""*I want you to know someday what it's like to love someone, truly love someone, before I take her from you*"" (This to Tyrion, as they both stand watching Myrcella sail to Dorne. A line spoken in anger of losing a daughter but really poetic when interpreted in the context of the relationship they are both unaware of) 

""*What good is power when you can't protect the ones you love?*""

""*Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls*"" 

""*I will burn cities to the ground if they touch her*"" 

""*Tell Myrcella her mother misses her very much*""

------

It makes Jaime's scene with Myrcella a much more complex one. He was trying to tell her about *her past* but when Myrcella tells him she knows about him and mother (Cersei)... It's a whole other revelation. And then being called father for the first time is another emotional gut punch. Things happen in quick succession and she dies in his arms before he can process any of it. 

This also makes Jaime that much more empathetic to Brienne (who is charged with protecting the Stark girls). In Brienne, he sees not just the knight he was, but also the protector. Brienne becomes an even stronger reflection of Jaime in this context... enough to have him give her his sword and look so wistful when Brienne names it the ""OathKeeper"".

-----

Lastly, it makes Tyrion's playful connection with Myrcella seem poetic. And it makes his political chess game of sending Myrcella to Dorne while Cersei revolts vociferously saying ""Its too much. You've given away too much"" just heartbreaking. 

-----

We haven't heard where Tysha went after the humiliating ordeal. She was a huge emotional influence on Tyrion but we haven't had that story pay off enough. 

And Tyrion has often rued - *Where do whores go*

---

So, if you're still here - do you think this works? Or is it fundamentally flawed for some reason I'm missing? It feels like just the trope the show lays with clever scenes and dialogs and the prophecy twist is typical of GRRM. It makes you see Cersei and Jaime in a whole different light -- and a big part of GRRM's POV approach to storytelling is that our perception of good, bad, evil is so very presumptuous and flawed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to piece together a theory and wanted to check if any of you recall a mention &lt;em&gt;in the show&lt;/em&gt; of Jaime being set up for an arranged marriage in the past?&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, I decided to describe it here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why 7 episodes?**

Asoiaf and this season especially contains many religious references. Number 7 is very important in many religions. That‚Äôs why GRRM is going to write only 2 additional books. That‚Äôs why D&amp;D initially planned to make 7 seasons, but then they decided to make 2 final seasons 7 episodes each.

&amp;#x200B;

**6th episode explanation: Fake ending - Bran's dream.**

**1)** The whole episode seems to be filled with illogical moments and intentionally absurd lines. My favourite is Arya‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know a killer when I see one‚Äù. IMO all this is written on purpose.

**2)** For Bran and all the Starks things are going as they dreamed in Bran‚Äôs childhood memories. When Starks lived happily together Sansa dreamed of becoming a queen, Arya dreamed of traveling, and John was a bastard with one destiny - to serve in the Night Watch.

**3)** In the scene on the small council we see everything through Brans eyes:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_YNDWeni7e8&amp;t=100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YNDWeni7e8&amp;t=100)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5th episode explanation: Lord of Light used Daenerys to destroy King‚Äôs Landing**

**1) GoT religion**

The religion in asoiaf/got is dualistic. There are only 2 gods:

\- God of Fire, Light and Life - Lord of Light

\- God of Ice, Darkness and Death - Great Other (let‚Äôs call him God of Death)

All other deities are whether false or secretly one of these two.

Many-faced god = God of Death

Faith of the Seven consists of 6 false aspects and 1 true aspect - Stranger, which represent death. Essentially, Faith of the Seven = God of Death. People in King‚Äôs Landing were worshipping the God of Death.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Kinvara's prophecy (s06e05):**

*‚ÄúDaenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world... She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins... Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light.... Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come... The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äú*The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands*‚Äù = Lord of Light will burn KL

‚Äú*Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light*‚Äù = Lord of Light guided Daenerys since her birth. He gave her fire resistance and the dragons.

‚Äú*nonbelievers ‚Ä¶ burning their sins*‚Äù = Lord of Light will punish people in KL for their sins and for that they are worshipping God of Death (new gods).

*‚Äúin this war and in the great war still to come‚Äù =* this war - war against the Night King. Great War is still to come.

‚Äú*She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins*‚Äù  - Meereen - King‚Äôs Landing analogy

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Burning KL:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVIWkVmtY0&amp;t=75s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVIWkVmtY0&amp;t=75s)

Daenerys looks at the Red Keep and starts to fly straight towards to Cercei. Then the Lord of Light takes control and starts to burn everyone. We do not see Daenerys‚Äô face during the destruction of the city.

Bells are not just a symbol of surrender but also a symbol of the worshipping of God of Death.

&amp;#x200B;

Characters that were in the city during the attack represent 7 deadly sins and 7 aspects of the Faith of the Seven (new gods):

***7 deadly sins:***

Envy - Cersei 

Pride - Euron - ‚ÄúI am the man who killed Jaime Lannister‚Äù

Wraith - Mountain 

Gluttony - Hound

Greed - Golden company captain

Lust - the northerner who was killed by Jon

Sloth - Jaime(?) - ‚ÄúI never cared about the innocents‚Äù

***7 fake gods:***

The Father - represent divine justice - Davos

The Mother - represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth - The woman who saved Arya

The Maiden - represents purity - her daughter

The Crone - septa Unella(?)

The Warrior - represents strength and courage in battle - Jon

The Smith - represents creation and craftsmanship - Qyburn

The Stranger - represents death and the unknown - Arya

&amp;#x200B;

The girl (Maiden) had a toy similar to Sheereen's toy.

Arya‚Äôs horse represent death. 

The horse also may symbolise the horse Khal Drogo gifted Daenerys at the wedding (s01e01), which means that Daenerys is not just the queen anymore, she is the Lord of Light's chosen.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Meereen - King‚Äôs Landing analogy (Breaker of Chains):**

||Meereen                   |King‚Äôs Landing|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chains|Literal chains|False religion|
|Slaves|Slaves of the masters|Slaves of the god of death|
|Freeing slaves|Breaking the chains|Burning them all|
|Opposition|Sons of Harpy|Faceless men (Arya)|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What will happen in the 7th episode (Potential Spoilers!):**

**1) Melisandre‚Äôs prophecies**

""Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false gods. Take them and cast your light upon us."" - Melisandre s02e01

Lord of Light should cast light from the sky on Daenerys and make her the chosen one (PTWP) for what she did in the episode 5.

To fully fulfill the PTWP prophecy she needs to kill Jon with Longclaw and burn him.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Bran‚Äôs season 6 vision:**

This vision is about what will happen in the end of GoT:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBpz6iVEIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBpz6iVEIk)

Daenerys + Drogon flying over KL + Burn them all =&gt; Daenerys will burn KL

Starks are dying =&gt; Jon and Arya are the only Starks in KL. They will die.

There are 4 shots with Daenerys and after each of them there are shots with a baby becoming white walker. =&gt; Daenerys will become the chosen of Lord of Light.

Sunset. Take a closer look and see that in this vision the beam of light illuminates the snowy ground =&gt; Lord of Light casting the light on Dany

Sequences with Jaime and Mad King. Jaime = Jon. Mad King = Dany.  =&gt; John walks over to Dany and asks ""Where is my sister?"" (Arya). At that moment Arya is already dead.

A beam of light illuminates the Mad King and the Iron Throne  =&gt; Lord of Light will cast the light on Daenerys and Iron Throne. Iron Throne will probably melt.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Daenerys in the House of the Undying**

I really think than the scene of Daenerys defeating Pyat Pree in the House of Undying is foreshadowing of the process of her becoming the chosen one:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFb2EjWBhWQ&amp;t=450s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFb2EjWBhWQ&amp;t=450s)

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Other foreshadowing of Dany becoming PTWP:**

Quaithe: ‚Äú*To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow*‚Äù = to become the chosen one you must burn the KL.

Melisandre to Stannis (s2e10): ‚Äú*You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it.*‚Äù  Men serving you = Tyrion and Varys. Your family = Jon. Everything you once held dear = helping innocents.

""*Three fires must you light‚Ä¶ one for life and one for death and one to love""*   One for life = birth of the dragons. One for death = burning KL. One to love = burning Jon.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Overall: all prophecies + imagination (may be completely wrong)**

***King‚Äôs Landing:***

Arya will try to kill Daenerys and maybe even hurt her. Then Grey Worm will kill Arya and throw her down from the Red Keep. Then John will come. ""Where is my sister?""  Fight between John and Grey Worm. John wins, but badly wounded. Daenerys finishes off John with his sword (Longclaw). Drogon burns the body of John. Then Lord of Light will cast light from the sky turning Daenerys into the chosen one. Longclaw becomes Lightbringer.

***White Walkers:***

Bran will learn about the origins of the White Walkers and possibly their connection with the Faceless Men. Huge army of White Walkers(not wights) is coming from the north. The leader of new army will be a white walker with the face of Jaqen H'ghar (i have no clues or foreshadowing of this happening whatsoever, just imagination). The Long Night begins.

What's up with the Night King? I think he was kind of God of Death's apostate. That would explain why it was Arya who killed him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5th episode explanation: Lord of Light used Daenerys to destroy King‚Äôs Landing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) GoT religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religion in asoiaf/got is dualistic. There are only 2 gods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù = Lord of Light guided Daenerys since her birth. He gave her fire resistance and the dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Äúin this war and in the great war still to come‚Äù =&lt;/em&gt; this war - war against the Night King. Great War is still to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù  - Meereen - King‚Äôs Landing analogy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Burning KL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVIWkVmtY0&amp;amp;t=75s""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVIWkVmtY0&amp;amp;t=75s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys looks at the Red Keep and starts to fly straight towards to Cercei. Then the Lord of Light takes control and starts to burn everyone. We do not see Daenerys‚Äô face during the destruction of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bells are not just a symbol of surrender but also a symbol of the worshipping of God of Death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that were in the city during the attack represent 7 deadly sins and 7 aspects of the Faith of the Seven (new gods):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;7 deadly sins:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Envy - Cersei &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride - Euron - ‚ÄúI am the man who killed Jaime Lannister‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wraith - Mountain &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluttony - Hound&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greed - Golden company captain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lust - the northerner who was killed by Jon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sloth - Jaime(?) - ‚ÄúI never cared about the innocents‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;7 fake gods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Father - represent divine justice - Davos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mother - represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth - The woman who saved Arya&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maiden - represents purity - her daughter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crone - septa Unella(?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warrior - represents strength and courage in battle - Jon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smith - represents creation and craftsmanship - Qyburn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stranger - represents death and the unknown - Arya&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl (Maiden) had a toy similar to Sheereen&amp;#39;s toy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya‚Äôs horse represent death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horse also may symbolise the horse Khal Drogo gifted Daenerys at the wedding (s01e01), which means that Daenerys is not just the queen anymore, she is the Lord of Light&amp;#39;s chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Meereen - King‚Äôs Landing analogy (Breaker of Chains):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Meereen&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;King‚Äôs Landing&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Chains&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Literal chains&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;False religion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Slaves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Slaves of the masters&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Slaves of the god of death&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Freeing slaves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Breaking the chains&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Burning them all&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Opposition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Sons of Harpy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Faceless men (Arya)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will happen in the 7th episode (Potential Spoilers!):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Melisandre‚Äôs prophecies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lord of Light! Come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false gods. Take them and cast your light upon us.&amp;quot; - Melisandre s02e01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord of Light should cast light from the sky on Daenerys and make her the chosen one (PTWP) for what she did in the episode 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully fulfill the PTWP prophecy she needs to kill Jon with Longclaw and burn him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Bran‚Äôs season 6 vision:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision is about what will happen in the end of GoT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBpz6iVEIk""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBpz6iVEIk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys + Drogon flying over KL + Burn them all =&amp;gt; Daenerys will burn KL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starks are dying =&amp;gt; Jon and Arya are the only Starks in KL. They will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 shots with Daenerys and after each of them there are shots with a baby becoming white walker. =&amp;gt; Daenerys will become the chosen of Lord of Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunset. Take a closer look and see that in this vision the beam of light illuminates the snowy ground =&amp;gt; Lord of Light casting the light on Dany&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequences with Jaime and Mad King. Jaime = Jon. Mad King = Dany.  =&amp;gt; John walks over to Dany and asks &amp;quot;Where is my sister?&amp;quot; (Arya). At that moment Arya is already dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beam of light illuminates the Mad King and the Iron Throne  =&amp;gt; Lord of Light will cast the light on Daenerys and Iron Throne. Iron Throne will probably melt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Daenerys in the House of the Undying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think than the scene of Daenerys defeating Pyat Pree in the House of Undying is foreshadowing of the process of her becoming the chosen one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFb2EjWBhWQ&amp;amp;t=450s""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFb2EjWBhWQ&amp;amp;t=450s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Other foreshadowing of Dany becoming PTWP:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quaithe: ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù = to become the chosen one you must burn the KL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melisandre to Stannis (s2e10): ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù  Men serving you = Tyrion and Varys. Your family = Jon. Everything you once held dear = helping innocents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Three fires must you light‚Ä¶ one for life and one for death and one to love&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;   One for life = birth of the dragons. One for death = burning KL. One to love = burning Jon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Overall: all prophecies + imagination (may be completely wrong)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;King‚Äôs Landing:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya will try to kill Daenerys and maybe even hurt her. Then Grey Worm will kill Arya and throw her down from the Red Keep. Then John will come. &amp;quot;Where is my sister?&amp;quot;  Fight between John and Grey Worm. John wins, but badly wounded. Daenerys finishes off John with his sword (Longclaw). Drogon burns the body of John. Then Lord of Light will cast light from the sky turning Daenerys into the chosen one. Longclaw becomes Lightbringer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Walkers:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran will learn about the origins of the White Walkers and possibly their connection with the Faceless Men. Huge army of White Walkers(not wights) is coming from the north. The leader of new army will be a white walker with the face of Jaqen H&amp;#39;ghar (i have no clues or foreshadowing of this happening whatsoever, just imagination). The Long Night begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s up with the Night King? I think he was kind of God of Death&amp;#39;s apostate. That would explain why it was Arya who killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I&amp;#39;m not Victoria&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

To give some thematic background, my theory operates under the idea that the show suggested that the end of ""the long night"" or ""winter"" (see the appearance of snow in episode 6) is not the defeat of the Night King but actually the ""breaking of the wheel"" or end to the Game of Thrones. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would mean the White Walkers were never the true great evil. People themselves are. This is HEAVILY suggested in the show... see episode 5 when the ""good guys"" start raping and killing innocents. GRRM's work has always been about the human condition, not some ultimate evil like traditional fantasies. This also explains the White Walkers not being the climax of the story. Whoever ends the Game of Thrones is the true hero of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

So now to the Azor Ahai theory....

&amp;#x200B;

All three candidates for Azor Ahai attempt to ""break the wheel"" at one point through a physical act.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stannis by the battle of blackwater
2. Danaerys in the overthrow of Cersei and sack of Kings Landing 
3. Jon when he kills Danaerys

&amp;#x200B;

My theory states that the first two were failed fulfillments of the Azor Ahai Prophecy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The prophecy goes as follows...

&amp;#x200B;

""To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating the weapon known as Lightbringer.""

&amp;#x200B;

\- So the first attempt by Stannis would be the battle of Blackwater. Ie: attempting to forge by water

&amp;#x200B;

... he fails

&amp;#x200B;

\- The second attempt would be Danaerys overthrowing Cersei and sacking kings landing. ie: attempting to forge by driving into the heart of the lion (the current throne holders house sigil)

&amp;#x200B;

.... Danaerys ultimately takes power (unlike Stannis) but promises a continued cycle of war and destruction in her victory speech. This spurs Jon and Tyrion's actions in the climax of episode 6.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The third and successful attempt.... Jon Snow drives a dagger through the heart of his love and current tyrant of Westeros. The script for season 8 had this moment written as ""THE END OF THE GAME OF THRONES"". 

&amp;#x200B;

This subsequently leads to Drogon LITERALLY burning the Iron Throne. Lightbringer?

&amp;#x200B;

 Bran ultimately takes power as an incorruptible leader. he is elected through fair means rather than chosen by birthright. A future with democracy is heavily implied. Wheel broken. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this theory would explain Melisandre interpreting the prophecy for Stannis as well as others subtly suggesting Danaerys could be Azor Ahai. All three had a role to play in the prophecies fulfillment... Azor Ahai is not a single person but rather humans attempt to overcome their nature and establish ultimate peace.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the show there are three characters that Melisandre and the Red Priests suggest could be Azor Ahai: Stannis, Danaerys, and Jon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some thematic background, my theory operates under the idea that the show suggested that the end of &amp;quot;the long night&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;winter&amp;quot; (see the appearance of snow in episode 6) is not the defeat of the Night King but actually the &amp;quot;breaking of the wheel&amp;quot; or end to the Game of Thrones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would mean the White Walkers were never the true great evil. People themselves are. This is HEAVILY suggested in the show... see episode 5 when the &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot; start raping and killing innocents. GRRM&amp;#39;s work has always been about the human condition, not some ultimate evil like traditional fantasies. This also explains the White Walkers not being the climax of the story. Whoever ends the Game of Thrones is the true hero of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now to the Azor Ahai theory....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three candidates for Azor Ahai attempt to &amp;quot;break the wheel&amp;quot; at one point through a physical act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stannis by the battle of blackwater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Danaerys in the overthrow of Cersei and sack of Kings Landing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon when he kills Danaerys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory states that the first two were failed fulfillments of the Azor Ahai Prophecy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prophecy goes as follows...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero&amp;#39;s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating the weapon known as Lightbringer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- So the first attempt by Stannis would be the battle of Blackwater. Ie: attempting to forge by water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... he fails&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The second attempt would be Danaerys overthrowing Cersei and sacking kings landing. ie: attempting to forge by driving into the heart of the lion (the current throne holders house sigil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.... Danaerys ultimately takes power (unlike Stannis) but promises a continued cycle of war and destruction in her victory speech. This spurs Jon and Tyrion&amp;#39;s actions in the climax of episode 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The third and successful attempt.... Jon Snow drives a dagger through the heart of his love and current tyrant of Westeros. The script for season 8 had this moment written as &amp;quot;THE END OF THE GAME OF THRONES&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subsequently leads to Drogon LITERALLY burning the Iron Throne. Lightbringer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran ultimately takes power as an incorruptible leader. he is elected through fair means rather than chosen by birthright. A future with democracy is heavily implied. Wheel broken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this theory would explain Melisandre interpreting the prophecy for Stannis as well as others subtly suggesting Danaerys could be Azor Ahai. All three had a role to play in the prophecies fulfillment... Azor Ahai is not a single person but rather humans attempt to overcome their nature and establish ultimate peace.&lt;/p&gt;

He doesn‚Äôt use his powers for anything good, he could have saved thousands of men at the Battle of Winterfell and he could have saved millions of innocent lives if he just told Jon Snow about Daenerys‚Äô evil plans and ended her right there.

The show had more potential in it for a Season 9 than it had a conclusion for the entire arc ending in Season 8.

He could find a way to avoid Bran's maneuvers and send word to other lords which would see Bran being found out and overthrown. Littlefinger wasn't plotting against the Starks for no reason: now they have a seething amount of power throughout the Kingdoms and Sansa has even become Queen of the North. All of this achieved how? Through Bran Stark willingly letting millions upon millions of innocents die when he could have EASILY saved them; through complete lack of honour and integrity: Remember how Sansa convinced Littlefinger to bring his forces from The Eyrie to Winterfell and single-handedly save the Stark army when Ramsay Bolton had them trapped? Then remember the Stark siblings who murdered that very man who saved them not so long ago without a fair trial?

However, maybe it's just about how the Starks ""move on"" and Arya will somehow start the Starks allover again somewhere else?

Anyways just a thought.

In fact, Daenerys's turn to the Mad Queen also makes sense, because the evidence was sprinkled throughout the series (I'll make a separate post for this). As for Bran, in order to fully understand why he was the best option, we must look at the Iron Throne itself, the nature of destiny in Game of Thrones, and how the show runners portrayed the decision making process. 

First off, I consider the Iron Throne as a separate character in the world of GoT. he general understanding is that people aim to win the IT, as ruling it is ruling Westeros. That very understanding gives the IT undeserved power, which in fact works to control those who aim to control it. In this way, those who play the so-called GoT are only puppets of the Throne they made their puppet master. Its a self-perpetuating cycle of pain and suffering wherein the throne is the ultimate antagonist, and rightfully so because it is the symbol of Westoros's greatest evil, the folly of human nature and charter and their desire to be all-powerful. Its the evil the seven kingdoms created themselves and oppress themselves with, and that evil is what needs to be defeated for a true turn in history. Drogon burning the throne signified the literal end to the GoT, and Dany's demise signified the metaphorical end. Given these circumstances, the person who would lead Westeros from now on could not be someone tied to the Game, or someone we had expected, or even wanted, to win that game. With that in mind, Dany, Jon, Sansa, Cersei, and Tyrion were automatically out of the question. Obviously Dany's and Cersei's deaths also played against their desires. Now, one might argue that Tyrion, Jon, and Sansa could be viable options given the three never really wanted the throne in the first place. While that is true, they were still players in the Game. Remember Jon and Tyrion chose a side (Dany's) and Sansa revealed the information about Jon's parentage because she knows that while she could not choose, Jon was in the position to make a choice. That meant his actions directly impacted the game, and in so doing, automatically disqualified him from being a theoretic contender after Dany's death. (Now I should mention this is all theoretic analysis based on the nature of the show itself, and not necessarily based on what happened in the last episode or second to last for that matter--that's why I had listed Dany and Cersei originally). Sansa and Tyrion both joined at different times and in so doing disqualified themselves. So who does that leave? Arya, Bran, Brienne, Davos, Jaimie, and Gendry. (Note here, I don't think any of the heads of houses would have been chosen, and nor were they actual contenders at the end since they all were party to either Dany or Cersei.) Of these six individuals, each is as unexacting as the one before, the least of which is Bran. Each character's arc is also highly inconsistent with becoming the ruler. Only Gendry makes slight sense but even then he was appointed Lord of Storm's End by Dany, and he doesn't even have the experience for that, let alone for ruling the Seven Kingdoms. Jaimie is a knight ( and he died), Davos is a sharp advisor, Arya is an adventurer and fighter, and Brienne is also a knight who lives for fulfilling her oaths. Not one of these characters would make sense. In fact, only the lead players of the Game did, but the game is over, while the position and responsibility remains. 

That leaves Bran. Bran as a character, doesn't really make any sense but not a lot is known about his viability since most of his arc is about the 3 Eyed Raven and defeating the Night King. But maybe that's exactly what the job entails. To understand this, we need to look at destiny. 

One of the guiding ideas for the main characters, especially Jon and to a much greater, and far more dangerous extent, Dany, is the idea of destiny. Jon became the prince who was promised, or so we thought, the one to ally with the Wildlings and the Southerners to kill the Night King and his army of the dead. His actions, from the moment he was brought back were defined by that destiny, one that was thrust upon him, but nonetheless, one he had to fulfill. Dany, on the hand, believed, throughout the entire series that she was destined to sit on the Iron Throne, and that nothing can change that destiny. Everything she did was to fulfill that destiny, until that destiny overpowered her. Again, we see characters giving an idea undue power, whether they do that themselves as Dany did, or hey follow the ramblings of another, as Jon did regarding Melisandre. 

So what does this mean for Bran? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, arguably, Bran is the holder of everyone's destiny. He is the keeper of life, of everyone's stories past, present, and future. Remember, in multiple cases he reassured others, including Jamie, Theon, and Jon that their actions were purposeful (even if they were not good)--Jamie when they met for the first time since the push, Theon before his death, and Jon upon their final goodbyes. He knows everything about everyone, even the fact that he would be chosen to rule-- remember, his response to Tyrion was, ""Why do you think I came all this way."" His knowledge also means that he likely knew what Dany was going to do. Now, this can be misconstrued as meaning he planned this to take on the throne himself, meaning he is evil, but remember the 3ER doesn't actually want anything. He has no desires, no needs, no wants. He exists only as the living memory of human existence. Bran said so himself-"" I don't really want anymore."" This means he had nothing to gain from becoming the king. But why not warn anyone? Because warning them about the future interferes with destiny (exactly what all other characters are trying to manipulate in one way or the other). Bran can't be implicated in Dany's actions because Bran never made any choices. He was already dead. The 3ER made those choices, and he did what he had to, because as we know, and as we have seen, when it comes to the big picture, to destiny, humans never make the right choice. Bran wouldn't have been able to either. But the 3ER could, and he did. Bran also allowed the North their independence because he understood what would happen otherwise. He also knew that the North was meant, even fated to become independent. He didn't do it to please his sister. 

So ultimately, Bran makes sense. And he breaks the wheel of oppression. Both his characteristics and the mode of his election make that clear.

They way he was chosen is quite telling. Before Tyrion argues for Bran's election, two very opposite options are presented. First, Edmure rises and tries to argue for himself. Edmure is an incompetent soldier, and would probably make a much more incompetent ruler. He is good on paper: veteran of two wars, Lord of Riverrun,etc. but we all know he can't do anything. He can't even perform a proper funeral sendoff. In fact, he basically represents the historical rulers of Westeros in that they were ultimately very wrong for the position, yet they were chosen anyways (granted Edmure is a the extreme version meant to illustrate that point). After Edmure comes Sam's suggestion for a democratic approach. This represents the complete opposite side of the spectrum, an extremely modern idea that is far too modern to even be considered plausible at this point in time. Both options were received less than positively, and there was a comedic element to them. They were the parameters between which the optimal choice existed. Edmure's rejection signified a desire for change, which worked to break the wheel of oppression that Dany had so desired to eliminate. They no longer wanted incompetence, but they were not ready for democracy. So they found a middle ground in Bran. Bran was elected by a kind of representative democracy. He was deemed competent, and because he was elected based on merit, that cycle of abuse ended. More importantly however, Bran himself represented the lack of oppression. He does not want anything, he has no ulterior motives, and he spends a lot of his time in the past. Characteristically, there is no one better to rule than someone with no ulterior agenda, but an in depth knowledge of what works and what doesn't based on historical precedence.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be an unpopular opinion here, but Bran becoming the new ruler actually does make sense if you are willing to look at it objectively.

Allow me to clarify:

In the books there is a one armed blacksmith named Donal Noye at the wall.  Donal has two very important plot moments. In GOT Donal is the one who gives Jon Snow the speech about bullying and acting better than his fellow brothers.  In ASOS Donal is the one who holds the tunnel during the wildling attack and dies defeating Mag the Giant.

In the show Donal doesn't really exist. Instead his bullying speech is given by Tyrion and his last stand in the tunnel is done by Grenn. 

 In order to reduce the amount of case needed, many main characters end up preforming actions or roles that were done by someone else entirely. This means that many of the events that happen in the later seasons are probably preformed by different characters. Here are my predictions about this differences.


1) Victorian Greyjoy teams up with Daenrys instead of  Yara and Theon Greyjoy.  This one seems pretty obvious given the where book 5 left us with Victorian already on his way to Slaver's Bay.



2) Cersi is killed and replaced by ""Young Griff"" Aegon Targaryen. Since the show completely abandoned the Mummers Dragon plotline, they needed to keep Cersi around as the final villian, but really had nothing for her to do except sit around and drink wine. I predict that in the book Young Griff will be the one in control of king's landing. After taking Storm's end, the golden company will take advantage of the sudden death of King Tommen to seize control of King's Landing and plant Young Griff on the throne.   Daenerys madness might be caused by Young Griffs better ""possibly fake"" claim to the throne with all the commons cheering for Young Griff instead of the more contrived everyone cheering for the ""king in the north"" that no one even knows has a claim to the throne.  Griff seizing the throne while Daenery's is busy fighting in the North or seizing it right before Daenery arrives both seem possible.


3) Archmaester Marwyn will be Daenery's advisor, not Varys.  In the books Vary's is very clearly on team Young Griff.  He has been secretly raising and grooming an individual to be the best possible king for the Realm. To Varys, Daenerys and her brother were merely tools to get young Griff on the throne. I don't see Vary's ever joining up with Daenery's but instead Marwyn filling that role.


4) Dorne allies with young griff and not Daenery's.   In the show it was very clear that giving Daenery's the support of both Dorne and High Gardern was a mistake because the conquest of King's landing would have be no contest at that point. To fix that mistake Dorne was simply removed immediately from the picture, followed shortly by High Garden despite the Lannisters not having nearly enough power to due so.  Instead Dorne will throw its support behind young Griff and aid in the taking of king's landing just so they can try to get revenge against the mountain. Sorry Cleganebowl fans, but the Sand snakes also want revenge. Using snake in the grass tactics Dorne might show up to King's landing pretending to be there to help just like the Lannisters did during Roberts rebellion. It would be very poetic revenge to sack the city in the same way the Lannisters did when they murdered Elia Martell.

Next update after 21st July. 

Penultimate update [6/3]

Several messages regarding the BLL premiere. I'm not saying the premiere will not start the BLL season. I agree that can't and won't happen. 

What is definitely true - is that there is more than one GOT season 8 episode pending. There are several episodes (at least 3-4) required for the resolution /explanation of just the arcs that I've worked out (and I'm not even 100% there). 

Another undebatable definite truth is that these episodes are happening. Just the songs from this Spotify list that D&amp;D curated will establish that. If you don't wanna take my word as assurance, at least take theirs. Each and every song is a significantly detailed spoiler about someone in the game. Just pay attention.  https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-09/how-will-game-of-thrones-end-stream-the-creators-new-playlist-to-find-out/

Seems there are two options on scheduling - either GOT remaining episodes announcement happens around the BLL premiere and HBO finds slots for both shows to run in parallel

 OR 

what would be absolutely mental (and seems most likely now) is the show picks up ""after"" the BLL season finale (BLL is a 7 episode series from the 9th). It does make commercial sense for HBO to do the latter given these are both their top shows - stretch out subscription period and revenue. 

It also makes this a complete ""crossover"" of the two shows - which HBO seems to have been hinting at heavily.

This does irk me significantly because it'll be literally  a 10 week gap from GOT 806 episode. But then that line suddenly makes sense .... 

Jon (The Audience) - ""Was it right? It didn't ""feel right"" 
Tyrion (David and Dan) - *Ask me after 10 years (weeks)* 

Anyway, irrespective of whether the finale episodes are teased this weekend or not (I'm really still hoping so), my final post detailing the explanations I've figured out on all the arcs I mentioned below -- will be posted next week ie 10th - because I promised. 

It might be a spoiler for those who read it and see the clues and it might be hogwash for those who have the compelling need to diss it blindly. Whatever. Read it (of you want to) and decide for yourselves on the 10th.

I promised to do it. So I will. It's a question of honor. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Update [6/2]

6/2 was the week we saw nothing. I was unsure about dates before tonight. But I'm betting on 9th June. 
BLL premiere will reveal a Big Little Lie. 



*****-------*****

Edit Note [6/1] on 3 Easter Eggs as recent as Season 8

Ok, some of you have messaged asking for some screen evidence Easter eggs to believe there's still hope. While there will be plenty from Season 1 when you start noticing, I'll reveal 3 very recent ones from Season 8.

*Dany whispering in Jorah's ears at the funeral, Dondarrion telling us that the Umber symbol was a message from the NK, Jaime shoving his gold hand in our faces at least three times in a single episode*

I won't reveal more right now, but I'll explain it all if the show doesnt resume act 2 latest by 9th June. Cheers.

*****-------*****

(*Edit Note [6/1] regarding dates - On the basis of signals so far, I am still 500% confident of everything below. But I reckon there's a chance I could be off the mark re: dates by a week or so. So if nothing happens this week, I will now wait till 9th June and then post the explanation link thread as the next update on 10th*

*A sincere request - Many before you have already written about how delusional and warped this is because they don't get it. If you echo that thought and have nothing substantial to add to it, just downvote this post or upvote one of those extremely original comments mocking me. More abuse is not necessary or helpful for anyone trying to navigate this already humongous thread. Thanks for considering this.*) 

*****------*****

Just a clarification here [5/30] : My reasons are not circumstantial. My clues or indicators are not tactical. There are numerous pieces of evidence in the actual show and the songs if you chose to pay attention when everyone was busy cribbing - enough to paint a sufficiently clear picture. 

Crows Lie, King of Ashes, Valar Dohaeris, Old Friend, Only Us, Light Bringer, Nissa Nissa, Jenny of Oldstones, Rains of Castamere, Dornishmans Wife, Mirri Maz Durr, Hodor, Burn Them All, Fire and Blood, North Remembers, What is Dead,... It's everywhere you look once you've found the thread. I don't want to spoil it because watching it unfurl will be an experience to remember. But I promise to do an explainer post in the future irrespective.

One addition [5/27] This song : https://youtu.be/cUIB2P5tkGU hand picked by D&amp;D as a wink to the wait to the end :) 

The other songs from that Spotify list are also *all* very insightful.

Post Documentary addition [5/26] - WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE, BUT RISES AGAIN HARDER AND STRONGER ;)

That telling signoff line from the documentary aside, if there's no other signals from HBO by 2nd/3rd June about the upcoming remaining episode(s), I will write out the 15-20 arcs I have figured myself (with solid evidence from the show). It is the show evidence that makes me so cocky and confident and it is also the reason I didn't want to spoil anything. But if the wait is absurdly long, it gets tiring. I understand.

*TLDR of original post - 806 was a mock script.*
*We have at least one (99% likely more than one) - episode(s) left to tie absolutely everything together - the 3ER, the Night King, White Walkers, Noone, Varys, Azor Ahai, The Actual Three Heads of the Dragon (So many people are wrong about this one), Valonqar, The Drowned God, The Lord of Light, The Weir wood, The Seven, The Valyrian Swords, The Prince That Was Promised...and much more. The ones I named are just the ones I've figured out so far.*

*The clues have been cleverly written all over the series and yes, it's all coming together.*

Original Post

I am beyond 100% sure of this now.
Every criticism thrown at the show by the fan verse will be flung back at our faces this coming week.

Episode 806 was a mock script of a finale. Could be a dream, could be straight up joke, could be offered as an alternate ending that works fine for some people. Idk. Take your pick. But basically absurd enough that the masses fall for it, but the observing connoisseurs can see the mocking nature of it. A prisoner dictating terms on succession, absolute nobodys like Brienne, Davos, Royce (with Robin Arryn present) - voting on ascension, North seceding with a nod of head, Arya and Grey Worm appearing and disappearing from nowhere, Queenslayer being sent off to castle black coz Grey Worm suddenly feels sober, Arya sailing off a pirate coz why not. 

Please guys. There's an extent of absurdism that the show has not touched upon before. Why does it go there in the finale?!?!?! 

806 basically feels like a Mashup of scenes that has laughed at different fan theories - from Dany being a physical Dragon, to Drogon flying away with Dany to the East LOTR style, to the proposal of Democracy. Multiple water bottles in clear view. The Edmure Tully scene is a literal dig asking the troll experts to ""please sit"". It's genius.

Need some semblance of backup to this claim? 
While there are several - here's two I'm willing to divulge.  My claim is not based on these since they are only circumstantial in nature. My claim is based on the fact that the show has clearly fed us Easter eggs till the very last episode (*eg. Dany whispering in Jorah's ears at the funeral, Dondarrion telling us that the Umber symbol was a message from the NK, Jaime shoving his gold hand in our faces at least three times in a single episode*). 
It makes sense when it all ties in seamlessly. 

That said - 

GOT official Instagram channel  https://www.instagram.com/gameofthrones/ (a work of art in itself) doesn't have a single scene from that mock finale. (*Note: As on May 29, ie 10 days post the finale, it contains 3 heavily trance/dream effect inspired pics - in comparison to the 9-12 average for the other episodes in the season. I have a feeling it's a sign of some movement. I think we'll see 3 more per day leading up to the weekend - and it will lead to the announcement*) 

Beautiful Death https://beautifuldeath.com/ (an officially endorsed artistic chronicle of the epic deaths every episode) doesn't have a sketch for the finale. Nor does it even acknowledge Euron and the twin Lannisters dying in the sketch for Episode 5.

Coming to the true criticisms of closure and pacing - save this post - you haven't seen it end yet. I was earlier convinced they are hiding only the real finale. Then when I got to unraveling the theories, there's still 15-20 different WTFs that I've worked out which the show has set ample screen, dialog and even song lyric evidence for. 

With the exception of Arya - Needle - Nymeria (Correction: I think I've got this one too! *The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives!* OMG, GRRM .... you effing genius) and a little bit about Missandei / Grey Worm (I'm still looking for clear evidence here), I feel I have mostly worked out everything else (at least definitely the arcs I mentioned in the TLDR) . 

They are absolutely going there for an epic wrapup that will blow everyone's mind. We need more than one episode for it... And that's where I was nervous. 

Then I read an Aidan Gillen interview from yonder where he says that he will be watching the show weekly like everyone else, until the week it won't show and he will be wondering why we took a mid season break. :) :)

Buckle up. A lot of mind blowing WTFs coming our way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update [6/10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post on what happens next : &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/byl17t/prepare_for_therapy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/byl17t/prepare_for_therapy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 important questions that&amp;#39;ll give you 10 roads to the end (can&amp;#39;t stress how this is not exhaustive by any means) : 
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/byl17t/prepare_for_therapy/eqmv270?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/byl17t/prepare_for_therapy/eqmv270?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next update after 21st July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penultimate update [6/3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several messages regarding the BLL premiere. I&amp;#39;m not saying the premiere will not start the BLL season. I agree that can&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is definitely true - is that there is more than one GOT season 8 episode pending. There are several episodes (at least 3-4) required for the resolution /explanation of just the arcs that I&amp;#39;ve worked out (and I&amp;#39;m not even 100% there). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another undebatable definite truth is that these episodes are happening. Just the songs from this Spotify list that D&amp;amp;D curated will establish that. If you don&amp;#39;t wanna take my word as assurance, at least take theirs. Each and every song is a significantly detailed spoiler about someone in the game. Just pay attention.  &lt;a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-09/how-will-game-of-thrones-end-stream-the-creators-new-playlist-to-find-out/""&gt;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-09/how-will-game-of-thrones-end-stream-the-creators-new-playlist-to-find-out/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems there are two options on scheduling - either GOT remaining episodes announcement happens around the BLL premiere and HBO finds slots for both shows to run in parallel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what would be absolutely mental (and seems most likely now) is the show picks up &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; the BLL season finale (BLL is a 7 episode series from the 9th). It does make commercial sense for HBO to do the latter given these are both their top shows - stretch out subscription period and revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes this a complete &amp;quot;crossover&amp;quot; of the two shows - which HBO seems to have been hinting at heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does irk me significantly because it&amp;#39;ll be literally  a 10 week gap from GOT 806 episode. But then that line suddenly makes sense .... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon (The Audience) - &amp;quot;Was it right? It didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel right&amp;quot; 
Tyrion (David and Dan) - &lt;em&gt;Ask me after 10 years (weeks)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, irrespective of whether the finale episodes are teased this weekend or not (I&amp;#39;m really still hoping so), my final post detailing the explanations I&amp;#39;ve figured out on all the arcs I mentioned below -- will be posted next week ie 10th - because I promised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a spoiler for those who read it and see the clues and it might be hogwash for those who have the compelling need to diss it blindly. Whatever. Read it (of you want to) and decide for yourselves on the 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised to do it. So I will. It&amp;#39;s a question of honor. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update [6/2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/2 was the week we saw nothing. I was unsure about dates before tonight. But I&amp;#39;m betting on 9th June. 
BLL premiere will reveal a Big Little Lie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit Note [6/1] on 3 Easter Eggs as recent as Season 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, some of you have messaged asking for some screen evidence Easter eggs to believe there&amp;#39;s still hope. While there will be plenty from Season 1 when you start noticing, I&amp;#39;ll reveal 3 very recent ones from Season 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dany whispering in Jorah&amp;#39;s ears at the funeral, Dondarrion telling us that the Umber symbol was a message from the NK, Jaime shoving his gold hand in our faces at least three times in a single episode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t reveal more right now, but I&amp;#39;ll explain it all if the show doesnt resume act 2 latest by 9th June. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Edit Note [6/1] regarding dates - On the basis of signals so far, I am still 500% confident of everything below. But I reckon there&amp;#39;s a chance I could be off the mark re: dates by a week or so. So if nothing happens this week, I will now wait till 9th June and then post the explanation link thread as the next update on 10th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sincere request - Many before you have already written about how delusional and warped this is because they don&amp;#39;t get it. If you echo that thought and have nothing substantial to add to it, just downvote this post or upvote one of those extremely original comments mocking me. More abuse is not necessary or helpful for anyone trying to navigate this already humongous thread. Thanks for considering this.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a clarification here [5/30] : My reasons are not circumstantial. My clues or indicators are not tactical. There are numerous pieces of evidence in the actual show and the songs if you chose to pay attention when everyone was busy cribbing - enough to paint a sufficiently clear picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows Lie, King of Ashes, Valar Dohaeris, Old Friend, Only Us, Light Bringer, Nissa Nissa, Jenny of Oldstones, Rains of Castamere, Dornishmans Wife, Mirri Maz Durr, Hodor, Burn Them All, Fire and Blood, North Remembers, What is Dead,... It&amp;#39;s everywhere you look once you&amp;#39;ve found the thread. I don&amp;#39;t want to spoil it because watching it unfurl will be an experience to remember. But I promise to do an explainer post in the future irrespective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One addition [5/27] This song : &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/cUIB2P5tkGU""&gt;https://youtu.be/cUIB2P5tkGU&lt;/a&gt; hand picked by D&amp;amp;D as a wink to the wait to the end :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other songs from that Spotify list are also &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; very insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Documentary addition [5/26] - WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE, BUT RISES AGAIN HARDER AND STRONGER ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That telling signoff line from the documentary aside, if there&amp;#39;s no other signals from HBO by 2nd/3rd June about the upcoming remaining episode(s), I will write out the 15-20 arcs I have figured myself (with solid evidence from the show).

Bran won the Iron Throne, Tyrion won the Game of Thrones]

Like most, after watching the finale the first time, I was shocked and disappointed. Over the next few days, my anger snowballed, collecting more and more reasons why this finale (and season) was such a failure. My only comfort was sharing in the pain and angst of the rest of the dejected fandom, misery loves company. 

However, recently, it dawned on me that I, like many others, may have watched the finale ‚Äúthe wrong way‚Äù. If you go into the finale with the mindset that the one who wins Iron Throne = ‚Äúthe winner‚Äù, you cannot be satisfied.  It‚Äôs guaranteed disappointment. Who actually likes the idea of Bran as the king??  Fuck that. 

Only when you start to separate The Iron Throne and Winning does it start to make sense.

From the start of the first season, we‚Äôve seen that Bobby B was not in control of the 7K, not even close. He has advisors, his family, his queen, all conspiring and undermining him. Joffrey, Tommen, essentially the same if not worse. Everyone who has touched (figuratively) the Iron Throne has ultimately died. 

In contrast, we‚Äôve seen others who are in true control that do not sit on the throne:
Tywin, the High Septon and to a degree, in his prime, Littlefinger. 

Getting to my main point- the finale is telling us that although Bran the Broken has won the Iron Throne, it is Tyrion that has won the Game of Thrones. 

If you rewatch the finale with this perspective, you will see that this episode is the Tyrion show.  The amount of screen time and dialogue for Tyrion in this episode is really telling. 

It starts off with Tyrion leading the survey of the aftermath of KL, Jon Snow and Daavos clearly behind him. 

Tyrion gets a solo emotional scene to mourn his brother and sister and close the book on the Lannister family as we know it. More on this later...

He gets a fantastic moment where he makes a suicidal stand and punts away his Hand pin in front of Dany and all her followers. 

While imprisoned, he plants seeds of doubt and urgency into Jon Snow‚Äôs head priming him to the possibility that he must take action against Dany. 

Again while imprisoned, he rallies ‚Äúthe most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros‚Äù and literally handpicks the next King. 

I believe we are supposed to view all of the spotlight and success of Tyrion in this episode as a showcase of his power/leadership and how that will counsel and shape the next generation of Westeros. 

Here are some more thoughts...

THE CHAIR SCENE. Holy crap! On first watch I was so pissed. So upset they wasted precious seconds on something so meaningless. On second watch, with my Tyrion glasses on, what I took away from that scene was the symbolism of Tyrion‚Äôs approach to rule. Tyrion has good intentions to do things the right way. But immediately after he tidies up the chairs and is satisfied with the result, the crew rolls in and messes everything up again. This is to show that one man, honorable intentions or not, cannot rule how he wants to alone. For better or worse, he is influenced and to some degree dependent on those he trusts. It‚Äôs a system, a game that must be played properly. 

BRAN‚ÄôS ARROGANCE. The finale showed a different side of Bran from the previous episodes of the season. He was less distant and a bit cockier than before. On first watch, this was a huge turn off for me, I hated it and hated Bran. It gave the impression that he lied to and played everyone. 

But again on second watch, with new perspective, I didn‚Äôt see cocky, but just someone who had a plan and had it unfold. I don‚Äôt think Bran‚Äôs plan to be king was out of greed or selfishness. This might be a stretch, but he wanted to be king because he knew Tyrion was the right person but could never sit on the throne. Whether it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs the imp or some other reason, he would never be accepted as king of Westeros. 

If Bran is still the 3ER (and we have no reason to think otherwise), he will continue to become more 3ER and less Bran as time passes (unless everything they said before was just bullshit).  As the last scene showed, Bran as the 3ER is not capable of sitting in council meetings to discuss mundane court affairs. He has other more important 3ER shit to do. 

Bran will serve in a role of supreme advisor/oracle to Tyrion, as Tyrion acts in the best interest of the kingdom. 

THE 3ER‚ÄôS PLAN. If what I‚Äôm saying above tracks and Brans plan was to get himself and Tyrion in power, at least two things needed to happen: Dany out of the picture and Cersei dead. 

Bran/Tyrion cannot rule as long as Dany and her dragons are around. This is why Bran urges Sam to tell Jon about his lineage - to drive a wedge between Dany and Jon and ultimately, Dany and the Starks. Bran needs Dany to take of Cersei but needs Jon and the Starks to take out Dany. 

Obviously, since Cersei had the throne she needed to be dealt with for this plan to be successful. But there is a subtler reason why Cersei not only had to be dethroned, but killed. All of Tyrion‚Äôs failures and missteps the past few seasons trace back to his inability and unwillingness to let go of Cersei and ties to House Lannister. The show has made clear that Jamie was addicted to Cersei, but in a different way Tyrion was as well. In order for Tyrion to reach his full potential, Cersei needed to die, not just be dethroned or imprisoned as her mere existence is enough to impact his decision making. That is the significance of Tyrion‚Äôs solo scene, where he gets to openly mourn his brother and sister and close the book on House Lannister of the past and press the reset button. Tyrion insisted that he go by himself because around others he would not be able to fully express his grief/sorrow as Cersei was the enemy. 

This isn‚Äôt to say that Bran planned for Dany to burn down KL and murder innocents. But he needed at least Dany and Cersei out of the way and he played his chess game to get himself in position. 

Ok so this is my attempt at filling in the huge gaps left by the writers or possibly even bending the story to my liking. After initial watch, I hated hated hated the finale so much and was so disappointed I found myself looking for any answers to fill the void I was left with. 

After changing my perspective as outlined above, I feel much better about it. I mean there are still huge problems with this season for sure but I think I‚Äôm at a place now where I‚Äôm somewhat satisfied and can let go of GoT peacefully without feelings of hate and anger. 

Oh I‚Äôm sure this will get picked apart in comments but hopefully it helps someone else cope with the void and feeling of hopelessness that the finale left in many viewers like me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[TLDR: Bran‚Äôs plan was to get himself and Tyrion in a position to rule.

I then woke in the middle of the night in a David-Lynch-esque moment with what I thought was the real meaning to the ending of Game Of Thrones. Probably just another theory half repeating others, but I'll put it together.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the final episode was meant to be understood a few different ways. One idea was that the wheel is not broken, and man (excuse gender for brevity please) has chosen the old way and will fight forever. History has repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion Lannister, grieving over the decline of his own family, convinced the emotional Jon Snow to be more concerned about his Stark sisters than the dream of breaking the wheel. He is half Stark, half Targaryen. In reality, rather than Daenerys choosing what is right for everyone, Jon chose what he thought is right for his family and the existing system, and his actions have prolonged the power of the Houses and the never ending wheel. That he could kill her while kissing her showed the trust of Daenerys, and her belief in that destiny, and that she believed Jon knew what needed to be done. It was a betrayal caused by his duty to his 'family' overcoming the love for Daenerys and that destiny. ""Sometimes duty is the death of love"" - duty to his house killed the love for humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

In choosing to kill Daenerys, Bran Stark was made King, a man who understands the stories of the past. However he is a King that can only look at the past, at what is already known. The wheel will start again, maybe even before Bran dies. This was evidenced by the folly of Edmure Tully declaring his hand, and Sansa already trying to divide the Kingdom and taking it back to before the Targaryen reign. All the old Houses still remain, and are stuck with the stories of the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Daenerys represented the new vision of unity and a single ruler with the power of Fire to rule over everyone. She outlined the process of the wheel, and had learned that fear is required to rule foolish men. Perhaps only when on the Dragon and connected with it did she truly understand the burning of the city was the new start that was necessary. It had been talked of before, the madness of the wheel had engulfed it and needed a new start. It was evidenced in the first meeting of the Kings Council that the old ways were back. Brothels were to be rebuilt as priority, it was to return to it's past. Selective history was to be written by the victors. Jaime Lannister's deeds were made out to be of a hero protecting a Queen. None of this was intentional, it is just the way of short-sighted men and women.

&amp;#x200B;

Jon DID understand what Daenerys needed to do, which some mistook as misguided by love. However Tyrion led him astray, following the Stark weakness in him. Westeros (the West) was not united, but required a ruthless leader to destroy all enemies to create lasting peace. (For example, the 2002 Movie 'Hero' \[Spoiler\] demonstrates what the King of Qin had to do to unite the warring states of China and create peace. He completely and ruthlessly destroyed any enemies. Coincidentally the character 'Snow' has an integral place in this plot. By the way, I'm not a Chinese propagandist!)

&amp;#x200B;

Drogon let Jon through to see Daenerys as a Targaryen, but he betrayed them despite all they had done for him. Daenerys had godlike powers with fire and the Dragons, and only she could have united and brought peace to the entire world. Jon could be beside her and create a dynasty of peace. Drogon, who is smarter than humans, melted the Iron Throne as it was only Daenerys who could sit on it to bring peace to the world. It was not created by the Dragons for humans to squabble over. Drogon could not kill Jon the Targaryen, but left him to live his life the old way.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya went west, taking her violence to the new world, whether for good or bad. Arya and the war with the Night King was a demonstration that violence and unity is needed to overcome a foe, and that men can unite to defeat that foe. However it seems in the end they cannot unite to create peace for themselves. This is the folly of man.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly Drogon then flew East, towards a mythical China, with Daenerys' body which does not belong to man. They could have shown him flying towards Arya's ship after circumnavigation and returning, but chose not to.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, was 'The Mad King' really mad? We don't know the full story and reasons. Maybe he was also trying to break the wheel, perhaps destroying the city with Wildfire was the start as he did not have Dragons, and Wildfire was his pseudo-dragon (Targareyens had made Dragon's ineffectual over time by caging them, and their power was lost, losing the throne. Did he become mad with Fire because Fire is within him but he did not have Dragons, but only Wildfire to fulfill his destiny?) The Targaryens' and Dragons' reasons cannot be understood by mere mortals. Perhaps the madness is understanding what needs to be done and Daenerys finally understood. A seeming tyrant is needed to unite and free future generations from warring with themselves. They had a gift of Fire (and Dragons) from The Children of the Forest from whom they descended, to give humanity peace. Instead, history is repeating, and man is frozen forever in the wheel.

&amp;#x200B;

Heading into the finale my girlfriend and I were speculating on who would end up sitting on the Iron Throne. Jokingly, I said Bran because I really had no idea and did not have high hopes, thinking low expectations would let me better enjoy this show we had come to love. After Bran the Broken came to pass in the show, I again joked with a friend about Bran being evil, a secret necromancer acting behind the scenes, doing some secret warging and sharing information at times he knew would lead to him being crowned king. But then I thought, perhaps my sense of humor is again lining up with D&amp;D's writing and some of the choices they've made with the show. D&amp;D would likely be aware of the prequels and spin-offs, even if they won't write or direct them so they left open questions and secrets that will be big reveals in the prequels. Perhaps this is just me being hopeful, but this could help explain away many of the bigger apparent weaknesses with the story.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

If we find out in the prequels:

The Night King/white walkers are some kind of undead conjurations controlled by evil Bran/Three Eyed Raven..

* This explains that Bran was not in fact doing nothing during the Battle of Winterfell, but actually controlling the forces of the undead in a way that kills off certain characters whose deaths are useful to Bran while leaving others alive who will help remove competition for the throne, even including half of those who will later vote for Bran to be king.
* White Walkers standing by as Arya goes in to vanquish the Night King? Bran let it happen.¬†
* Named characters in situations where they seemingly should die but do not? Bran actively kept them alive.¬†
* Lyanna Mormont would have demanded King Jon, she had to be removed.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Bran was secretly warging the Dragons and/or Daenarys..¬†

* From the show we do not know if warged people or creatures realize or understand what is happening to them, based on book information we might assume Daenarys thought she was fighting off madness as she does not know about warging. Like Hodor from the show, she may go along with her warger's wishes regardless of her own will even while not actively being warged.¬†
* During the Battle of Winterfell, Drogon stayed on the ground for seemingly no reason despite zombies crawling on him and starting to stab him, leading to Dany being un-dragoned, and the death of Jorah. His loss is seemingly one of the greater factors in her later destruction of King's Landing and supposed madness. Bran could have warged Drogon to keep him grounded.¬†
* Dany proceeds to destroy King's Landing after the battle is clearly won. Whether Dany is warged or Drogon and Dany just goes with it, this could have been controlled directly by Bran if not just instigated by his other manipulations.
* Dany's ""madness"" could be a symptom of receiving warged commands and her attempt to cope with it, being Hodorified, but perhaps more subtly if Bran has gotten better at using this power or just used a lighter touch.¬†
* Having previously warged Drogon, Bran will be able to ""locate"" him despite him being far away seeming to have flown across the sea, like book Arya and her sea-spanning connection to Nymeria. Special attention should be paid to the things Bran is shown to take interest in, because it's not often shown.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Why does the Google of Westeros provide some information while witholding others?¬†

* No warning/reminder of the threat of the Iron Fleet? Direct factor to Dany destroying King's Landing and ""going mad"".¬†
* Bran seems to care about nothing but makes great effort to get Sam to tell Jon about his parentage, and Bran sets the stage for maximum impact on Dany and Jon to eventually murder her, the crime that ultimately blocks him from being chosen as king.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Other thoughts..

* The Wall is a magic barrier but the mark that Bran received gave him a direct connection to the undead forces so he could still control them despite being on the other side of the barrier.¬†
* The Free Folk are free because they are free from the Necromancer, though this is forgotten even by them. Perhaps the Thenn are the descendants of those loyal to the Necromancer, they even live in a volcanic area furthest from civilization so basically they are the orcs and the Three Eyed Raven is GRRM's Sauron.¬†
* The Three Eyed Raven is a body snatching immortal, but has to steal bodies of warg/green seers to be able to continue the cycle. What's the point of being immortal if you don't end up ruling all the mortals and have the most power to ensure your continued immortality? The next King may already be being groomed, some young warg/green seer who will be voted in at the next kingmaking council.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the darkness we will discover in the prequels will be about a certain human in the Age of Heroes abusing the newfound powers of warging and green seeing, and like the tragedy of Hodor or the story of Sauron, we will find it very compelling. I hope that this will also mean that in a few years, after watching the prequels we will look back at the ending of Game of Thrones in a new, more informed way and have a better appreciation for the ending we just witnessed.¬†","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really loved watching the Game of Thrones adaptation of GRRM&amp;#39;s A Song of Ice and Fire and like many of you, I was quite disappointed with the poor story telling in the final two seasons.

D&amp;amp;D would likely be aware of the prequels and spin-offs, even if they won&amp;#39;t write or direct them so they left open questions and secrets that will be big reveals in the prequels. Perhaps this is just me being hopeful, but this could help explain away many of the bigger apparent weaknesses with the story.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we find out in the prequels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Night King/white walkers are some kind of undead conjurations controlled by evil Bran/Three Eyed Raven..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This explains that Bran was not in fact doing nothing during the Battle of Winterfell, but actually controlling the forces of the undead in a way that kills off certain characters whose deaths are useful to Bran while leaving others alive who will help remove competition for the throne, even including half of those who will later vote for Bran to be king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Walkers standing by as Arya goes in to vanquish the Night King? Bran let it happen.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Named characters in situations where they seemingly should die but do not? Bran actively kept them alive.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyanna Mormont would have demanded King Jon, she had to be removed.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran was secretly warging the Dragons and/or Daenarys..¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the show we do not know if warged people or creatures realize or understand what is happening to them, based on book information we might assume Daenarys thought she was fighting off madness as she does not know about warging. Like Hodor from the show, she may go along with her warger&amp;#39;s wishes regardless of her own will even while not actively being warged.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Battle of Winterfell, Drogon stayed on the ground for seemingly no reason despite zombies crawling on him and starting to stab him, leading to Dany being un-dragoned, and the death of Jorah. His loss is seemingly one of the greater factors in her later destruction of King&amp;#39;s Landing and supposed madness. Bran could have warged Drogon to keep him grounded.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany proceeds to destroy King&amp;#39;s Landing after the battle is clearly won. Whether Dany is warged or Drogon and Dany just goes with it, this could have been controlled directly by Bran if not just instigated by his other manipulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;madness&amp;quot; could be a symptom of receiving warged commands and her attempt to cope with it, being Hodorified, but perhaps more subtly if Bran has gotten better at using this power or just used a lighter touch.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having previously warged Drogon, Bran will be able to &amp;quot;locate&amp;quot; him despite him being far away seeming to have flown across the sea, like book Arya and her sea-spanning connection to Nymeria. Special attention should be paid to the things Bran is shown to take interest in, because it&amp;#39;s not often shown.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the Google of Westeros provide some information while witholding others?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No warning/reminder of the threat of the Iron Fleet? Direct factor to Dany destroying King&amp;#39;s Landing and &amp;quot;going mad&amp;quot;.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran seems to care about nothing but makes great effort to get Sam to tell Jon about his parentage, and Bran sets the stage for maximum impact on Dany and Jon to eventually murder her, the crime that ultimately blocks him from being chosen as king.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other thoughts..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wall is a magic barrier but the mark that Bran received gave him a direct connection to the undead forces so he could still control them despite being on the other side of the barrier.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Free Folk are free because they are free from the Necromancer, though this is forgotten even by them. Perhaps the Thenn are the descendants of those loyal to the Necromancer, they even live in a volcanic area furthest from civilization so basically they are the orcs and the Three Eyed Raven is GRRM&amp;#39;s Sauron.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Three Eyed Raven is a body snatching immortal, but has to steal bodies of warg/green seers to be able to continue the cycle. What&amp;#39;s the point of being immortal if you don&amp;#39;t end up ruling all the mortals and have the most power to ensure your continued immortality? The next King may already be being groomed, some young warg/green seer who will be voted in at the next kingmaking council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the darkness we will discover in the prequels will be about a certain human in the Age of Heroes abusing the newfound powers of warging and green seeing, and like the tragedy of Hodor or the story of Sauron, we will find it very compelling. I hope that this will also mean that in a few years, after watching the prequels we will look back at the ending of Game of Thrones in a new, more informed way and have a better appreciation for the ending we just witnessed.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

For all we know, here with Game of Thrones, we have fake account of events, based on history, written by victors!

Let's theorize...

Nights King's defeat seems extremely suspicious. My theory is that there never were white walkers, just overdemonized tribes of certain wildlings, who had very certain customs and appearance.
Wildlings were battling among themselves and some of them were allowed down the wall, just like German tribes entering Roman territory and serving in Roman army. 
Night King was just wildling King Beyond the Wall, who only went down to Winterfell trying to defeat the adversary army, who were preparring massive assault on wildling lands beyond the wall.

How he broke the wall actually, that needs to be researched yet.

Tyrion bids them all to pick their new ruler. Sansa and Arya instantly nominate Jon, but Greyworm interjects. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthis man must face justice. He cannot be king.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHe is a good man‚Äù replies Tyrion, ‚ÄúAnd he has the noble bloodline. Aegon Targaryen, 5th of his name, king in the north and protector of the seven kingdoms-‚Äú
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it‚Äù. Jon, still in his shackles, stares at the cracked ground of the dragon pit. The lords of the seven kingdoms watch intently, not daring to break the silence that has engulfed the entire ruin. 
‚ÄúYou saved the people of Westeros from total annihilation. You faced the armies of the dead and you freed Kings landing from a tyrant-‚Äú
‚ÄúHe is an oath breaker! And so are you imp.‚Äù Grey Worm pulls out his dagger, but before it leaves its sheath Arya Stark has already drawn both needle and her valerian steel dagger. ‚ÄúIf your blade shaves a single hair off my brothers neck, I‚Äôll slit your throat.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSit down girl.‚Äù Says Yara GreyJoy, who is also now standing with her hand grasping the handle of her sword. ‚ÄúYour brother is a traitor, an oath breaker, and a kin killer. He deserves nothing more than a headless corpse.‚Äù
Arya, still staring down Greyworm, points her needle at yara. ‚ÄúI suggest to those of you who want to live to see tomorrow to remain seated.‚Äù
‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù Tyrion silences everyone once again. ‚ÄúThe bloodshed must end. The fighting and petty bickering must end. We have the opportunity to create a new world. A better world. We must break the wheel now or we will forever be crushed by it. We need a ruler who values wisdom and courage over house and title. We need a truly good, unbiased king who will put the common good above his own self interest.‚Äù The silence has returned once again. Greyworm, Arya and Yara have all now sheathed their weapons as they eagerly await to hear what the little man would say next. ‚ÄúIt cannot be Jon. I understand. But there‚Äôs another. Brandon Stark. You are the three eyed raven and keeper of our entire history. You journeyed beyond the wall in search of humanity‚Äôs salvation and it has made you into what you are today. I cannot think of any other more worthy than the title of king.‚Äù
No one speaks. Everyone present stares in disbelief at Tyrion, but slowly their eyes shift towards Brandon Stark. Bran‚Äôs face is emotionless; in his eyes a quiet snow storm rages. An immense wisdom can be felt from them. Eyes that did not belong to him, but rather those who came before him. Those who came before. 
‚ÄúBut I cannot be king.‚Äù Bran replies. ‚ÄúBrenden Rivers was no king; he was the three eyed raven as am I. My role in this story is truth and guidance. Nothing more. The long night has ended, but winter is still here. I wish merely to guide our rightful ruler. To show them the truths of the world.‚Äù
Tyrion struggles to comprehend Brans answer. ‚ÄúBut we have no king. There is no ruler to guide us you‚Äôre al we have.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou do have a king.‚Äù Bran replies. ‚ÄúIn fact, he is here. He‚Äôs always been here.‚Äù
Bran grows quiet, and it becomes apparent to all that he has said his piece. Jon, for the first time, lifts up his head and stares at his little brother. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand Bran‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNo one does.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù
A new voice. One that has yet to speak. All look to see who it belonged to. Eyes move from Edmure Tully to Robyn Aran until finally all gazes rest upon a single man. Gendry stands, holding in one hand a helmet with great sharp stag horns and, in the other, a small piece of parchment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived my entire life in flea bottom working over a hot forge. I was forced to make weapons for soldiers who would‚Äôve killed me if they knew who I was. Your father, Ned, found me. He saved me from the slaughter of every one of King Robert Baratheon‚Äôs bastard children and told me who I was. I found myself in Harenhal, worrying that every day would be my last. Arya saved me. I was sold into slavery, used for blood magic by the red woman. Davos saved me. I hid in Kings Landing under the noses of Lannister Soldiers. Tyrion saved me. I owe all of you a debt, and I will see it repaid. I, Gendry of House Baratheon, state my claim to the iron throne.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe woman who legitimized you is dead. No matter whose blood you have flowing through your veins you‚Äôre a young bastard with no ruling experience-‚Äú
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I intend to name the wisest man in Westeros, Brandon Stark, as my hand.‚Äù Gendry turns to Bran, who looks back at him blankly. Then, a light smile creeps on to his face, and Bran nods at Gendry. ‚ÄúWhy do you think I came all the way here?‚Äù 
Tyrion is still displeased. ‚ÄúNo. This isn‚Äôt breaking the wheel, it‚Äôs merely restoring it. We have an opportunity to change things for the better. Why are we using it to keep everything the same?‚Äù
‚ÄúBreaking the wheel.‚Äù Bran echoes. ‚ÄúA philosophy coined by the same woman you just called a tyrant.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe became misguided. She lost her way in the end, but her original goal is still an achievable one.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur role was never to break the wheel. That was Daenerys Stormborns role, and she was wrong. The moment Robert Baratheon died, false Kings have led Westeros into chaos. Now is the time to restore the wheel.‚Äù
Tyrion has nothing left to say. After hearing Brans story at the hearth in winter fell, he was enamored with the idea of the Three Eyed Raven. An all knowing entity that he could never come close to matching no matter how many books he read. Tyrion missed the feeling of being the cleverest man in all of Kings Landing, but now looking back at the company he kept while acting as Jofferys hand were not exactly Westeros‚Äô best. As much as Tyrion wished he was right, he couldn‚Äôt help but feeling that the game was over. For once in his life, he could not think of anything worth saying. 
Gendry turns to Jon Snow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lived your life as a bastard, never knowing how important you truly were until it was too late. I do not wish to make that mistake.‚Äù Gendry unrolls the piece of parchment in his hand. ‚ÄúDuring my time at dragon stone I felt that nothing had changed. I still was a mere blacksmith. That is until I received this by a little girl in rags.‚Äù Gendry handed the note to Bran, who unravels it and reads. ‚ÄúIt is from Varys. A final whisper.‚Äù Tyrion is caught off guard by the mention of his dear friend. It seemed that King Aereys‚Äô spider had one last trick. ‚ÄúWhen Lord Aryn found me, he asked me about my mother. I told him that I couldn‚Äôt remember her face. Only her voice. And her yellow hair.‚Äù
Bran finished reading the note and rolls it back up. 
‚ÄúWhat does it say?‚Äù Asked Sansa, who until now has been just as quiet as the other lords. 
‚ÄúIt says what I‚Äôve always known.‚Äù Replied Bran. ‚ÄúGendry Baratheon, son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, is the true heir to the iron throne.‚Äù
Everyone looks at Gendry, who stands tall with his head bowed. The truth has been spoken, now the time has come to see whether it has been heard. Everyone whispers amongst themselves, puzzling over what they had just heard. Sansa looks towards Arya in hope of some sort of acknowledgement, but Arya does not return her gaze. Instead, she is fixated on the boy she had loved since she was a little girl being hunted in through Forrests and ruins. 
Jon catches Gendry‚Äôs eye. The strong young king had humbled himself with a serious demeanor, but as the two friends fell into each other‚Äôs gaze, they both could not help but smile.

Arya interrupts the incessant whispers of her fellow lords and ladies by standing to face her new king. ‚ÄúI was by your side when we had nothing. You protected a little girl running away from home. Now let a girl protect you. I, Arya Stark, demand to be named Lord Commander of your Kings Guard. And I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù
A few shouts of ‚Äúhere here‚Äù can be heard. Gendry smiles at her. He had always wanted her by his side, and now her own path has finally lead her back to him. 
Tyrion speaks up once again. ‚ÄúSo, it is decided then?‚Äù
All reply, one by one, with ‚Äúayes‚Äù. As the order continues, the flood of approval ends with Sansa. ‚ÄúI do not know who you are. It seems that I am the only one who is unfamiliar with you. You seem to know my sister quite well, however. But Arya is not a lady. I am.‚Äù With this statement, Sansa leans forward and begins to challenge Gendry. ‚ÄúThe North will never accept a southern ruler. Why should I?‚Äù
Gendry, after seeming invincible for the shortest amount of time, drops his head in disappointment. He only knew about the Lady of Winterfell‚Äôs demeanor through stories of soldiers passing through the Armory during the Great War. She was cold and fierce like the north itself, and she loves her people and only her people. What could he possibly say to change her mind?
‚ÄúMy lady.‚Äù
Sansa turns around and is surprised to see Brienne of Tarth staring down at her. ‚ÄúBefore I had ever met your mother, I was sworn to Renly Baratheon. I watched helplessly as he was murdered by blood magic. I promised myself I would avenge him and I did. But I have still always felt that I had failed him.‚Äù Briennes eyes move from Sansa to Gendry. ‚ÄúI will not fail him again.‚Äù
For the first time in her life, Sansa noticed how tall Brienne was. She towered over the Lady of Winterfell, and her armor suddenly shifted from a glorious suit to a hard menacing shell of war. ‚ÄúI, Ser Brienne of Tarth, would be honored to lived by your side your grace.‚Äù

All eyes finally end with Greyworm. They all wait to hear his response.
Greyworm has not been listening. His mind could no longer be bothered by talk of kings and bloodlines. His thoughts trailed towards an island that waited for him and his lover that spoke often of a paradise by the sea. Greyworm nodded his head. He had made his decision.
‚ÄúKneel, Arya Stark.‚Äù
Arya kneels before her king.
‚ÄúDo you forfeit all your titles, lands, and fortunes-‚Äú
‚ÄúYes now can we just get on with it?‚Äù
Jon snickers. Gendry lets his smile show. A warm, gentle smile. 
‚ÄúI, Gendry Baratheon name you Lord Commander of the Kings Guard.‚Äù","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrion and Jon, imprisoned by the unsullied for the murder of queen Daenerys, stand before the lords and ladies of Westeros‚Äô noble houses. Tyrion bids them all to pick their new ruler. Sansa and Arya instantly nominate Jon, but Greyworm interjects. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthis man must face justice. He cannot be king.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHe is a good man‚Äù replies Tyrion, ‚ÄúAnd he has the noble bloodline. Aegon Targaryen, 5th of his name, king in the north and protector of the seven kingdoms-‚Äú
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it‚Äù. Jon, still in his shackles, stares at the cracked ground of the dragon pit. The lords of the seven kingdoms watch intently, not daring to break the silence that has engulfed the entire ruin. 
‚ÄúYou saved the people of Westeros from total annihilation. You faced the armies of the dead and you freed Kings landing from a tyrant-‚Äú
‚ÄúHe is an oath breaker! And so are you imp.‚Äù Grey Worm pulls out his dagger, but before it leaves its sheath Arya Stark has already drawn both needle and her valerian steel dagger. ‚ÄúIf your blade shaves a single hair off my brothers neck, I‚Äôll slit your throat.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSit down girl.‚Äù Says Yara GreyJoy, who is also now standing with her hand grasping the handle of her sword. ‚ÄúYour brother is a traitor, an oath breaker, and a kin killer. He deserves nothing more than a headless corpse.‚Äù
Arya, still staring down Greyworm, points her needle at yara. ‚ÄúI suggest to those of you who want to live to see tomorrow to remain seated.‚Äù
‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù Tyrion silences everyone once again. ‚ÄúThe bloodshed must end. The fighting and petty bickering must end. We have the opportunity to create a new world. A better world. We must break the wheel now or we will forever be crushed by it. We need a ruler who values wisdom and courage over house and title. We need a truly good, unbiased king who will put the common good above his own self interest.‚Äù The silence has returned once again. Greyworm, Arya and Yara have all now sheathed their weapons as they eagerly await to hear what the little man would say next. ‚ÄúIt cannot be Jon. I understand. But there‚Äôs another. Brandon Stark. You are the three eyed raven and keeper of our entire history. You journeyed beyond the wall in search of humanity‚Äôs salvation and it has made you into what you are today. I cannot think of any other more worthy than the title of king.‚Äù

(1) prophecies that are passed down for 1000's of years are going to be misinterpreted and subject to the rules of telephone (remember that they didn't even know that ""prince"" and ""princess"" were interchangeable)

(2) words like ""hero"" are relative based on the storyteller. so, a hero to the lannisters would be a villain to the starks. important to keep this in mind when listening to a prophecy given by the followers of the lord of light.   


OK, so here we go. the explanation is....  (drum roll) azor ahai (""AA"") is: **the night king** and lightbringer (""LB"") is: **the ice dragon.** here's how it makes perfect sense: following the caveats above, azor ahai is not necessarily a ""good guy"". he was just good for the team that he played for. once we remove the preconceived bias that he has to be playing for the protagonist, there's no reason he can't be the night king (i.e., our antagonist). not only that, but once we abandon the juvenile perception that the hero has to win, there's no reason we can't root for the prophecy to be defeated. so, let's look at all of the information we know about AA and LB in these lenses :  
(1) original azor ahai was approximately 8,000 years earlier. that is also when the ""long night"" started. azor ahai returns to prevent (or end) the long night after a long summer. -- *JTT comment: first, we know that a long summer just ended. so check that box. next, the night's watch started the same time that the original long night started (8,000 years ago). third, most people were perplexed why the night's watch was necessary after the white walkers were defeated. well, what we see at the end of the series is that castle black was actually occupied by the wildlings who were waiting out winter. once that was over, they abandoned the castle and the night's watch - the night that lasted 8,000 years - was over. that was due to the NK dying. true, he didn't directly end it. but in true GRRM fashion, it is an indirect fulfillment of the prophecy.*  
(2)  (a) ""According to prophecy, **our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and reforge the great sword Lightbringer** that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, **a terrible weapon forged with a loving wife's heart.** Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much at least the Lord of Light is clear on.""‚Äï[Thoros of Myr](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Thoros_of_Myr); (b)  **He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer**, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.[\[1\]](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-1);  (c) **Lightbringer was able to boil the blood of a monster when Azor Ahai thrust the sword through the belly of the beast. After steam poured from the beast's mouth and its eyes melted, its body burst into flame.**[\[2\]](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer#cite_note-Radwd10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2)  (d) When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst **smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.**[\[11\]](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Radwd49.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-11)  *JTT comment: (a) we saw the NK wake a dragon that was buried in the ocean. whether ice or rigor mortis one can argue that the dragon was stone;  (b) the NK threw his ice javelin into what appeared to be the heart of the dragon to kill it; (c) when the dragon was hit by the ice javelin it burst into flames; and (d) the dragon was filled with smoke immediately before plunging into the depths of the water, and pulled from the salt water before being brought back to life.*  
(3)  According to the [Jade Compendium](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jade_Compendium), since that day the sword became as warm as Nissa Nissa was and burned fiery hot during battles. *JTT comment: we know that the body of a dragon is perpetually hot. there is no reason to think that an ice dragon would be different. assuming arguendo that it was, it would be so cold as to burn...* 

 

(4)  ""Behold! A sign was promised, and now a sign is seen! Behold [Lightbringer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer)! Azor Ahai has come again! **All hail the Warrior of Fire! All hail the Son of Fire!**[\[3\]](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3)‚Äî[Melisandre](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre) at [Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone) *JTT comment: a weapon born of a dragon and shooting ice fire could easily be described as a warrior of fire and a son of fire.*

(drum roll) azor ahai (&amp;quot;AA&amp;quot;) is: &lt;strong&gt;the night king&lt;/strong&gt; and lightbringer (&amp;quot;LB&amp;quot;) is: &lt;strong&gt;the ice dragon.&lt;/strong&gt; here&amp;#39;s how it makes perfect sense: following the caveats above, azor ahai is not necessarily a &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot;. he was just good for the team that he played for. once we remove the preconceived bias that he has to be playing for the protagonist, there&amp;#39;s no reason he can&amp;#39;t be the night king (i.e., our antagonist). not only that, but once we abandon the juvenile perception that the hero has to win, there&amp;#39;s no reason we can&amp;#39;t root for the prophecy to be defeated. so, let&amp;#39;s look at all of the information we know about AA and LB in these lenses :&lt;br/&gt;
(1) original azor ahai was approximately 8,000 years earlier. that is also when the &amp;quot;long night&amp;quot; started. azor ahai returns to prevent (or end) the long night after a long summer. -- &lt;em&gt;JTT comment: first, we know that a long summer just ended. so check that box. next, the night&amp;#39;s watch started the same time that the original long night started (8,000 years ago). third, most people were perplexed why the night&amp;#39;s watch was necessary after the white walkers were defeated. well, what we see at the end of the series is that castle black was actually occupied by the wildlings who were waiting out winter. once that was over, they abandoned the castle and the night&amp;#39;s watch - the night that lasted 8,000 years - was over. that was due to the NK dying. true, he didn&amp;#39;t directly end it. but in true GRRM fashion, it is an indirect fulfillment of the prophecy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(2)  (a) &amp;quot;According to prophecy, &lt;strong&gt;our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and reforge the great sword Lightbringer&lt;/strong&gt; that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, &lt;strong&gt;a terrible weapon forged with a loving wife&amp;#39;s heart.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much at least the Lord of Light is clear on.&amp;quot;‚Äï&lt;a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Thoros_of_Myr""&gt;Thoros of Myr&lt;/a&gt;; (b)  &lt;strong&gt;He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer&lt;/strong&gt;, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-1""&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;;  (c) &lt;strong&gt;Lightbringer was able to boil the blood of a monster when Azor Ahai thrust the sword through the belly of the beast. After steam poured from the beast&amp;#39;s mouth and its eyes melted, its body burst into flame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer#cite_note-Radwd10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2""&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;  (d) When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst &lt;strong&gt;smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Radwd49.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-11""&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;JTT comment: (a) we saw the NK wake a dragon that was buried in the ocean. whether ice or rigor mortis one can argue that the dragon was stone;  (b) the NK threw his ice javelin into what appeared to be the heart of the dragon to kill it; (c) when the dragon was hit by the ice javelin it burst into flames; and (d) the dragon was filled with smoke immediately before plunging into the depths of the water, and pulled from the salt water before being brought back to life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(3)  According to the &lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jade_Compendium""&gt;Jade Compendium&lt;/a&gt;, since that day the sword became as warm as Nissa Nissa was and burned fiery hot during battles. &lt;em&gt;JTT comment: we know that the body of a dragon is perpetually hot. there is no reason to think that an ice dragon would be different. assuming arguendo that it was, it would be so cold as to burn...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4)  &amp;quot;Behold! A sign was promised, and now a sign is seen! Behold &lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer""&gt;Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;! Azor Ahai has come again! &lt;strong&gt;All hail the Warrior of Fire! All hail the Son of Fire!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3""&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;‚Äî&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre""&gt;Melisandre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone""&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;JTT comment: a weapon born of a dragon and shooting ice fire could easily be described as a warrior of fire and a son of fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) She is Azor Ahai returned  ... &lt;strong&gt;death itself will bend its knee, and all those who die fighting in her cause shall be reborn&lt;/strong&gt; ...&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Radwd22.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-9""&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;‚Äî&lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Haldon""&gt;Haldon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion_Lannister""&gt;Tyrion Lannister&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;JTT comment: death bending its knee? followers being reborn? this is the NK verbatim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bran mentioned that The Night King went after many a Three-Eyed Raven and failed, but at the same time, The Night King was only ever defeated, not destroyed...

It may be that every time the NK went after a 3ER and 3ER (with help from other people) was able to defeat, but not destroy the NK, a kind of ""reset"" happened. Meaning that the 'Long Night' events that were suppose to ""reenact"" from the Age of Heroes (Azor Ahai prophecy) started to ""manifest"" (spiral wheel motif) with each reset. 

So it finally happened now, but ""out of order"" and with variation (variable exchanges). 

I too was bummed that the characters (say for Bran) were not really awaken to truth about Westoros past, because I thought that is what was sending them to their doom in the next couple of episodes. That because it wasn't realized, meant they didn't learn anything, but the last two episodes turned that around, as the Azor prophecy is mostly fulfilled...

One really strong theme was this idea of ""othering"" and alienation with groups of people bestowing exclusion/inclusion on other groups of people based on often semi-superficial things, such as character traits being associated to houses. Jon's arguments in the back half of the story was about not allowing himself to buy into ""sins of the father"", saying that we have to let our heritage go, if we want to survive and be better people. Granted he still had traits that many would associate with House Stark, but really, I think he was better person than most people generally speaking and the Starks most likely have contentious history too. (*cough *cough Still waiting for she-wolves of Wintefell!)

You know nothing, Jon Snow = ignorance can be bliss, and no one has all the answers, except maybe, Bran, depending if he can see the future too, but his choice not to tell them may not be malicious, just the way it has to be...

So maybe there is some Alice in Wonderland like logic with defeating the WW/bringing in the Dawn in that, maybe the former 3ERs kept trying to tell various reincarnates their destiny/the true history of Westoros past and every time letting them know the truth failed them. So this time the reason they were successful is because they really didn't know the truth, the past wasn't truly remembered; sins of the father at last broken!

I also think that we will get more answers in the 'Long Noght'/Bloodmoon prequel TV series since the teaser synopsis points us to that conclusion:

Jon is the one to stop this cycle and break the wheel. He is the shield to humankind as they know it he has to be the tipping point by killing Danny (just like we are the shield to humankind as we know it) Jon represents us

&amp;#x200B;

Death is the love of duty = Duty is sometimes the love in death = Means if you are mindlessly dutiful it is blinding and can lead into just the love of killing in the name of duty. But eventually you kill so many people that you end up killing someone you love OR loved. (Jaimie dying finally flips the switch for Tyrion snapping him out of the blindness / haze of following Danny with blinding faith, while also killing Cersei at the same time (he felt it was his duty from a young age to kill Cersei he hated her, that duty to kill Cersei resulted in the death of Jaime at the same time)

iron throne vision was warning to Danny that she would burn down everything she loved and was working towards in her mind to accomplish getting to even touch the throne (death = her duty)

politics in GoT - A democracy helps prevent the death of loved by preventing the duty in the love of death dealing for a person and to never mindlessly following one leader (IE not a king or queen in our case but a president trying to become a tyrant, also not mindlessly following two long time HOUESES of politics (Republicans and Democrats) who are destroying our planet which we are all mindlessly following them and willfully helping them (If that goes then we go along with our loved ones and what we care about) everyone needs to come to a compromise on what is good ( Jon is the example of compromise value between Sansa and grey worm (Two different view points and walks of life) (Doesn't have to die, but has to go live out at castle black which is a shitty post and a good idea in Greyworms head because all he knows about castle black is it's a lifelong watch but he had no idea Jon was lord commander of the watch before and broke that oath so in his mind it is a death sentence because he doesn't know of anyone defecting from the watch ( Sansa knows though he was Night Commander of the watch and he did escape his vow of duty through death and reincarnation. everyone who is every apart of that brotherhood would let him leave freely from castle black which is what he does at the ending)

&amp;#x200B;

Progressively killing more and more people on her conquest she didn't know that and have zero Impackt to her including her brother, mentions she can't count to 20 as a girl ""inbreeding dumb, Targs are therefore dumb"" It also shows in a way Danny and her brother had a similar relation ship to Tyrion and Cersei (they both most likely didn't care if either one died)

&amp;#x200B;

Jon finally realizes he hasn't been doing the right things either this whole time (oh but he actually has - keep on reading to find out further on) then realizing Danny is bad, he tries last second to save her like Tyrion saved him and snapped him out of this blinding haze of conquest and duty. Trying to reason with anything he thinks she holds dear. She cray and is trying to convince him now last second to stay crazy trying to imprint herself onto him with ideas of saving the world and how she can be his stupid little queen who can only count to 20 because she thinks it's cute. He realizes he can kiss her to create a diversion to pull his dagger and stab her. (Drogon flying up shortly after shows there is a deep connection between her and her dragons on a sub conscious level) Also showing that dragons are super intelligent beings in this universe even though they can't communicate through conventional speech.

&amp;#x200B;

""According to prophecy, our champion will be reborn to wake dragons from stone and reforge the great sword Lightbringer that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago. If the old tales are true, a terrible weapon forged with a loving wife's heart. Part of me thinks man was well rid of it, but great power requires great sacrifice. That much at least the Lord of Light is clear on.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jon snow never really awakes dragons from stone and is not Azhor Ahai (It is dany who is Azhor Ahai)

\-Lightbringer is not a sword but instead Dragon fire (Brings down lots of light (Powerful fire) on anyone it is used on) that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago ( Dragon fire / Dragon glass defeated the white walkers of the first long night)

\-Terrible weapon Forged in loving wife's heart (The Chaos the dragons can cause, especially Drogon. he is a terrible weapon used to destroy all of kings landing. Who was created by Danny from seemingly stone (Dragon eggs from her wedding) (Danny being the loving wife thinking she is doing the right thing saving all of her children and liberating the world)

&amp;#x200B;

Jon was making right choice all along though ( according to bran AKA god, AKA The one who created earth or w/e we think this place is and the universe) (There can't be a memory of not only our world but the universe we live in (All these movie / stories in another dimension actually just are different tracks in time)

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion in council meeting for the newly appointed council now leads to the end of the show / Perfect universe or world we ONLY DREAM OF ( Movies / Stories / Books are the creations of dreams) they are together setting up plans to move on with now towards a common goal for human kind ( Saving the planet and forming their democracy, people who are in charge of certain aspects of the city or city state, which they are also missing Master of whispers and their lord of war which in this new future that is filled with peace there is no need for one) this one little kingdom of people (the size of a normal state in USA) with a small council turns into the multi (Small councils = States) Until it's a huge body (Governments tons of small councils of people inside government right now (House / senate etc from each state)

&amp;#x200B;

Lets go meet other worlds and save our planet (Other worlds being other timelines of our mind (Memory = bran)

&amp;#x200B;

show just ends in all of us going on with our lives doing what WE need to do, loved ones all around us going towards our new destination in life (Loved ones around us at end of show is people you watched got with)

&amp;#x200B;

Jon shows us that there is indeed a right thing deep down in our very nature and of our being to do (he represents all of us) going forward now

&amp;#x200B;

Winter has ended due to Azhor Ahai prophecy (clearly stopped snowing and plants poking through the snow as jon is walking forward past the WALL into the unknown of the north lands (Donald Trump is the giant wall that we all need to walk past) (GRRM is a time traveler like BRAN and is warning us all, which means GRRM is our New KING(IE OUR NEW PRESIDENT) (Winter known as the most depressing month of the year for people with seasonal depression) so winter is now over and an endless summer is set in motion due to Azhor Ahai prophecy (Possibly everything we have done up until this point leading to global warming which is our endless summer) get out during the summer ( which it is right now of the time writing this)

&amp;#x200B;

GRRM Likes hive-mind type things in all his stories (maybe he is telling us the universe is one big hive-mind and we are all connected in some way with the other planets that we just don't know about yet)

&amp;#x200B;

Also what is the meaning of the white walkers - they are this big bad force of evil, this ""Idea"" that is hyped up to be the biggest threat over the whole course of the show (Our lives) but in the end it wasn't even the biggest threat (It was defeated so simply by destroying one person (destroying just one hateful idea)) it turns out we are just the biggest enemies to ourselves (we are the one destroying each other IRL and the planet we live on)

&lt;p&gt;-Lightbringer is not a sword but instead Dragon fire (Brings down lots of light (Powerful fire) on anyone it is used on) that defeated the darkness those thousands of years ago ( Dragon fire / Dragon glass defeated the white walkers of the first long night)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Terrible weapon Forged in loving wife&amp;#39;s heart (The Chaos the dragons can cause, especially Drogon. he is a terrible weapon used to destroy all of kings landing. Who was created by Danny from seemingly stone (Dragon eggs from her wedding) (Danny being the loving wife thinking she is doing the right thing saving all of her children and liberating the world)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon was making right choice all along though ( according to bran AKA god, AKA The one who created earth or w/e we think this place is and the universe) (There can&amp;#39;t be a memory of not only our world but the universe we live in (All these movie / stories in another dimension actually just are different tracks in time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrion in council meeting for the newly appointed council now leads to the end of the show / Perfect universe or world we ONLY DREAM OF ( Movies / Stories / Books are the creations of dreams) they are together setting up plans to move on with now towards a common goal for human kind ( Saving the planet and forming their democracy, people who are in charge of certain aspects of the city or city state, which they are also missing Master of whispers and their lord of war which in this new future that is filled with peace there is no need for one) this one little kingdom of people (the size of a normal state in USA) with a small council turns into the multi (Small councils = States) Until it&amp;#39;s a huge body (Governments tons of small councils of people inside government right now (House / senate etc from each state)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go meet other worlds and save our planet (Other worlds being other timelines of our mind (Memory = bran)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;show just ends in all of us going on with our lives doing what WE need to do, loved ones all around us going towards our new destination in life (Loved ones around us at end of show is people you watched got with)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon shows us that there is indeed a right thing deep down in our very nature and of our being to do (he represents all of us) going forward now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter has ended due to Azhor Ahai prophecy (clearly stopped snowing and plants poking through the snow as jon is walking forward past the WALL into the unknown of the north lands (Donald Trump is the giant wall that we all need to walk past) (GRRM is a time traveler like BRAN and is warning us all, which means GRRM is our New KING(IE OUR NEW PRESIDENT) (Winter known as the most depressing month of the year for people with seasonal depression) so winter is now over and an endless summer is set in motion due to Azhor Ahai prophecy (Possibly everything we have done up until this point leading to global warming which is our endless summer) get out during the summer ( which it is right now of the time writing this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRRM Likes hive-mind type things in all his stories (maybe he is telling us the universe is one big hive-mind and we are all connected in some way with the other planets that we just don&amp;#39;t know about yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also what is the meaning of the white walkers - they are this big bad force of evil, this &amp;quot;Idea&amp;quot; that is hyped up to be the biggest threat over the whole course of the show (Our lives) but in the end it wasn&amp;#39;t even the biggest threat (It was defeated so simply by destroying one person (destroying just one hateful idea)) it turns out we are just the biggest enemies to ourselves (we are the one destroying each other IRL and the planet we live on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoT is Crazy = GoT a TV show is going to change the World&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

if you watch the closing see of the last episode 

that is pure symbolism and literally shows but most people probably didn‚Äôt understand it but Jon Snow is the Night King... Jon Doe = Jon Snow now when Jon snow died the first time it opened a new story which allowed an alternate fate that‚Äôs why I think the night king was trying too hard to kill bran because if bran is dead that history of Jon becoming the night king stays that‚Äôs why the knight king also never talks it‚Äôs all symbolic.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya well see says no one has gone to the west and wants to adventure there. Implying lord of the rings Frodo end it does not matter because if you remember Hodor he kept saying hold the door before that was even revealed but he also said Hodor before that even happened Which opens the door of Jon snow = Jon doe being the night king because that also already happened 

&amp;#x200B;

just that which opened the door of Jon/night king to be human overwriting the initial version

like Hodor if you remember because that happened long ago yet when bran talked to him all he said was Hodor but that didn‚Äôt happen yet so why did he keep saying it if it didn‚Äôt happen

because it happened already just like Jon being the knight king also, the knight king never talks once and he literally wants to kill bran he is gung-ho why because by killing bran he would destroy all events that occurred also why doesn‚Äôt the knight king kill Jon snow when he is chasing him, he just looks back and just summons dead people to distract him so he can go to Bran why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, because by killing bran it would destroy the new history that happens like a rewrite and also because when Drogon was about to kill Jon he didn‚Äôt and he left with Daenerys that‚Äôs all they show in the show Jon thought Drogon was about to kill him however it just instead melted the iron throne at the end bran says where is Drogon I'm going to look for him

implying he can go inside dragon too like he can with ravens so, he must have redirected the fire death to Jon else that would be the point where he would be the night king since like he‚Äôs Jon snow plus Drogon magical element and to kill him where he already died once would ensure that would somehow make him the night king because dragon also is associated with ""magic"" because if you remember in season 1 it showed something like that magic/power coming and that because of Drogon it fueled it and why did the Night King stay idle? Perhaps because he is losing magic and by allowing the event of Drogon to kill Jon the ‚Äútrue king of the North‚Äù have infinite reserve to fuel being whatever it is but instead of being created by the Children of the Light (who knows how much control they might still have if any on them) perhaps wants to be the King of itself rule itself not on the terms of the Forest created on its own like a living organism so as to why he was so inclined to kill Bran perhaps by killing Bran it would allow Jon to die by Drogon but secondly, rewriting how the first Nightwalker was created and rewrite history by being created through Jon?

&amp;#x200B;

The true king of the north so the two can exist like Hodor; also, the thing is Drogon knew Jon killed Daenerys and it was about to blast him but it didn‚Äôt and I think why also people probably didn‚Äôt see this but perhaps bran he can go into anything right like ravens so he may have diverted it because if Jon where to die that would the turning point that reality of him becoming the night king since he already did die once along with the song of ice and fire (offspring of Stark and Targaryen happens the Night King stayed idle/MIA for many generations to hold the reserve till the right time?

&amp;#x200B;

The Red woman she knew she would die if she were to come back so why even bother? (the death of 1 dragon so magic already low) and she knew Arya would be the one to kill the White Walker hence she may have also known the second Dragon will die and probably lose power from that Amulet anyway so why not just help if she is going to die regardless because she is also a believer of not being able to change/control fate just guide it. Furthermore, perhaps it wasn‚Äôt the Lord of Light bringing the people back but since while the Red woman was right about few of her prophecies at the same time the Red woman so instead it could be the doings of the Night King himself to be able to also bring people back normally like Sandor Clegane and Beric Dondarrion for the Night Walkers aid? Additionally, the Red woman could also be 

Azor Ahai supposed wife since she was able to light up swords like the supposed and slept with various man who she thought could potentially be Azor Ahai who‚Äôs return she may have hoped for? Since what we thought Azor Ahai to be might just be false like how it was believed Rhaegar Targaryen raped and killed  Lyanna Stark? 

&amp;#x200B;

Arya is dead because by going west where no one knows what‚Äôs there but people know about all of everything and the maps and shit that‚Äôs bull and Arya is dead and its literally lord of the rings also since that show is very similar to it yet different, they took that idea she‚Äôs short‚ÄîFrodo look at all the other characters in contrast also to prevent copyright (also George R. R. Martin / J. R. R. Tolkien)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well here are my theories all jumbled throughout the day because all I did was think about everything and changing my mind and since I suck at organizing, I‚Äôll let the REEDitors do it for me if they bother to read it all) and also because I&amp;#39;d say this is my first post for anything ever since I hate organizing my own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

Following on from this theory about Littlefinger being the protagonist and a faceless man. This is definitely recommended watching before reading further:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFoCt1PxPCs&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFoCt1PxPCs&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

I think that at some point following the Battle Of Winterfell, Petyr Baelish, aka Littlefinger (who is still alive after having faked his death), was able to ambush Bran whilst he was alone, kill him and take his face.

&amp;#x200B;

From this point onwards, ""Bran"" would begin to work towards positioning himself and others in accordance with his known goal of obtaining as much power and influence in Westeros as possible. Littlefinger knows that Bran is listened to and trusted. Also, Bran was the only one who previously knew of Littlefinger's plans, so killing him removes him as an obstacle. This takes place somewhere amidst the events of episode 4. There is a scene where Tyrion suggests to Bran that he is now Lord Of Winterfell, and Bran refuses the title. We can assume this is either because Littlefinger had yet to get to him, or maybe, that ""Bran"" had no interest in that title, as he had much bigger plans in mind. Notice that following the Battle Of Winterfell, ""Bran"" is no longer shown using his sight. This is because he is no longer Bran. Although he mentions he will use it to find Drogon in the final episode, he conveniently leaves the room before doing so, and we never see him actually doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

When Jon is anguishing over telling Arya and Sansa about his true identity when they confront him about Dany, ""Bran"" tells him ""it's your choice""), knowing that in doing so, Jon would feel justified in telling his sisters. And Littlefinger knew Sansa well enough to know that she would pass the news to Tyrion, and it would eventually lead to all out chaos. And in the words of Petyr Baelish: chaos is a ladder. He knows he can count on Jon and Tyrion to take a stand against Dany in the wake of her committed atrocities (which are in part sparked by Littlefinger's manipulation of Jon into revealing his identity to his sisters), and would hardly be surprised to receive a summons to King's Landing in the wake of what transpires.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of it all, ""Bran"" is very careful to keep up the charade of not wanting power, feigning refusal, right up until the moment Tyrion proclaims him the ideal choice. ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" he says, knowing full well he has them all fooled. Through Bran's identity, Baelish claims the power he has always craved. Out of love for Sansa, he allows her to keep the North, accepting he can no longer be by her side. And he arranges for Jon to be sent to the wall, preventing him from being able to cause any problems.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's it. Welcoming criticism and any interesting input you all might have.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on from this theory about Littlefinger being the protagonist and a faceless man.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFoCt1PxPCs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFoCt1PxPCs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that at some point following the Battle Of Winterfell, Petyr Baelish, aka Littlefinger (who is still alive after having faked his death), was able to ambush Bran whilst he was alone, kill him and take his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point onwards, &amp;quot;Bran&amp;quot; would begin to work towards positioning himself and others in accordance with his known goal of obtaining as much power and influence in Westeros as possible. Littlefinger knows that Bran is listened to and trusted. Also, Bran was the only one who previously knew of Littlefinger&amp;#39;s plans, so killing him removes him as an obstacle. This takes place somewhere amidst the events of episode 4. There is a scene where Tyrion suggests to Bran that he is now Lord Of Winterfell, and Bran refuses the title. We can assume this is either because Littlefinger had yet to get to him, or maybe, that &amp;quot;Bran&amp;quot; had no interest in that title, as he had much bigger plans in mind. Notice that following the Battle Of Winterfell, &amp;quot;Bran&amp;quot; is no longer shown using his sight. This is because he is no longer Bran. Although he mentions he will use it to find Drogon in the final episode, he conveniently leaves the room before doing so, and we never see him actually doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jon is anguishing over telling Arya and Sansa about his true identity when they confront him about Dany, &amp;quot;Bran&amp;quot; tells him &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s your choice&amp;quot;), knowing that in doing so, Jon would feel justified in telling his sisters. And Littlefinger knew Sansa well enough to know that she would pass the news to Tyrion, and it would eventually lead to all out chaos. And in the words of Petyr Baelish: chaos is a ladder. He knows he can count on Jon and Tyrion to take a stand against Dany in the wake of her committed atrocities (which are in part sparked by Littlefinger&amp;#39;s manipulation of Jon into revealing his identity to his sisters), and would hardly be surprised to receive a summons to King&amp;#39;s Landing in the wake of what transpires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of it all, &amp;quot;Bran&amp;quot; is very careful to keep up the charade of not wanting power, feigning refusal, right up until the moment Tyrion proclaims him the ideal choice. &amp;quot;Why do you think I came all this way?&amp;quot; he says, knowing full well he has them all fooled. Through Bran&amp;#39;s identity, Baelish claims the power he has always craved. Out of love for Sansa, he allows her to keep the North, accepting he can no longer be by her side. And he arranges for Jon to be sent to the wall, preventing him from being able to cause any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it. Welcoming criticism and any interesting input you all might have.&lt;/p&gt;

This ""documentary"" is actually the cover for the secret finale. It makes no sense to have a behind-the-scenes documentary about a season that everyone hated as no one would want to watch that. The apparent ""highlight"" of the documentary is the cast crying.... So you're saying it's like essentially every finale ever? Episode 6 was entitled The Iron Throne and it covered everything in the story regarding the Iron Throne related parts of the storyline. All of the fantasy aspects of the show that were inexplicably left out of the ""finale"" would fit very nicely into a two hour long final episode entitled The Last Watch. This title is telling us that it's going to be the Last Watch for the Night's Watch as they're no longer going to be needed if it plays out like I have theorized in previous posts. If you're interested in my full reasoning for this secret finale and what I believe the end of the show will actually be, please give my previous posts a read. 

I think they are actively playing with everyone's PTSD over how another similarly confusing show, Lost, ended. I didn't watch that show at all but I know it was super confusing and from everything I heard and read, it really didn't make any sense and a lot of the story really didn't get resolved in the end. The big differences with this show and Lost are that Lost didn't have a set story, as well as it being network TV so they had to keep it going and going for advertising revenue purposes. This story actually has a pre-determined ending to it, regardless of what people may think, and GRRM has said that the show ending will be the same as the book ending based on his discussions with D&amp;D, and there's no way the books are ending like this. I think that the reason GRRM has not completed the last two books yet is because he went a little out of control world building and doesn't know how to reasonably get everyone everywhere they need to be for the end. In the show they just resolved this issue by having everyone travel at light speed everywhere they needed to go because no one really wanted to watch 2-3 episodes at a time dedicated to travelling back and forth across Westeros anymore. At this point in the story, there are so few story lines left that there would be nothing happening on these travels worth noting without just blatantly giving stuff away.   

For the sake of all that is good, I hope I'm right in my hypothesis and I've had fun theorizing with you, Internet. I really hope that we are all very happy come 11 PM Sunday night!

EDIT: This type of ending would be very beneficial for HBO from another large purely business standpoint that I haven't really gone deep on yet. The fact of the matter is that the media landscape has changed DRASTICALLY from the time the first episode of this series aired on Apr 7, 2011 to May 22, 2019. This would be the perfect way of getting people who wouldn't usually go to the HBO Go App otherwise and would have just gone to cable to watch (Gen X, but mostly Boomer's and up, etc.) because as people get older they get stuck in their ways. On-demand streaming services are the present and certainly the future of television. No better way to get people who wouldn't otherwise use your On-Demand App using it than making it the only place after the fact that you can (entirely legally) watch the surprise real finale of the biggest TV phenomenon we've seen worldwide. HBO's dominance of the market share in premium TV is over now because of multiple intertwined factors, those being that the viewing habits of the worldwide culture have shifted drastically due to giant leaps in streaming quality, as well as the types of competitors, such as: Netflix, Amazon, and Disney that HBO has to now deal with. People have been and will continue to be cutting the chord from cable television because there are much cheaper, much more convenient platforms for watching TV in HD quality in 2019 and beyond. People aren't appointment viewing in 2019 (for the most part) and that is the complete opposite of what direction the world is going in terms of how media is consumed. The only things that will remain cable/network television style viewing are live sports and current events because, obvious reasons. 

On Apr 4, 2011, Netflix's market cap** was $12.66 billion, compared to their market cap of $160.1 billion market cap on May 20, 2019. That is an increase of $147.44 billion in a little over 8 years time, which is absolute insanity. HBO doesn't care about competing against those other little brother premium cable networks like Showtime anymore. They can't just dominate the market because of their well earned, established brand due to a lack of viable competition anymore. HBO secured the trusted brand and the dominant position in the market that they've enjoyed for decades because they have consistently put quality TV shows on the air. They were able to sustain this high level quality because they have history of creating an environment where creative people are allowed to be creative and keep creative control of their vision, rather than having executives come in and mess everything up because they're beholden to the ratings and advertisers, rather than subscriptions*** (source below.) Netflix operates with much of the same vision creatively, although not executed nearly as well thus far, but with much deeper pockets so they can afford to take more swings and misses. Amazon and Disney's market caps are $938.24 billion and $207.56 billion, respectively, and both of whom will be offering much cheaper, more convenient platforms with much wider selections to choose from as time goes on with Disney Plus and Amazon Prime. To give a frame of reference to what it is that HBO is competing against, AT&amp;T, HBO's parent company, has a market cap of $198.96 billion.

If my hypotheses is correct, which I hope for all our sake that it is, this way of playing it would be absolutely brilliant. Sorry, I know this probably comes off as strident but it's not my intention. I just think they've made a great move all around if I'm correct and I want provide context as to why it is that I think that is the case. I hope it pans out for all of us!!!  


** Market cap is an easy way of determining relatively how much a company is worth. While it does gives you a good idea of a company's value most of the time, it's not entirely accurate all of the time as it only takes stock price and outstanding shares into consideration (Market Cap = Share Price x # of Outstanding Shares.) This is important because the stock market and stock prices can be very reactionary based on human emotions at a given time period rather than actual market forces or real business performance.

But I' ve camed up with two of that possible ""better"" backgrounds. The first is the far writted and imaginated theory of 'Bran/3ER is x (evil or NK or whatever)', I've always loved that theory and this end can provide more basis to support it.

The other one is the one that I'm going to try to develop in this post:

**The ""Game Of Thrones"" is a metaphoric chronicle about power and how it handles the people and the 'class struggle' as engine of the history of the mankind.**

So, the principal plot of the series is the fight for the throne. And during 7 seasons, Westeros has a Medieval Feudalism as the main system of society and power, with kingdoms reign by tyrants, more or less evil and cruel and more or less honorable and loyal; but tyrants, with all the power, who at the end doesn't care about people needs and whereabouts, the only thing that matter to them is keeping their dominion and authority. The Iron Throne is the maximum expression of that machiavellian focus on power. And the rulers fight for it over and over, with rebellions from another tyrant, with traisons, with alliances...All count in that game of thrones.

Like in human history, religion is a really important principle to many people and eventually powerful figures realises that and try to use it for their own profit. Even sometimes someone can create a feeling so strong whit it that apollogetically in that emotion and creating a mighty organization even is able to make an attempt of rebellion and getting the power. In the series, however, the High Sparrow doesn't come out well in that intention.

In that point is where the marxist postulate of the 'class struggle' shows up. If the people over the years has had to endured misery, hungry, death, war, etc. there comes a time when they are gonna be so pissed and so angry that can really become a threat to that 'establishment'. And history exhibit multiples examples where those situations end up with an individual standing up as the ""Messiah"", the savior of the people, the one who was destined to 'break the wheel'. Obviously that person is embody in Dany. But the really important concept of this point are the dragons, I come back to this later, but I equate the dragons (and Unsullied, and Dothrakis, etc.) with the power of the people.

That power of the angry people can degenerate and corrupt in populism and in a dictatorial state with fascism and repression by 'burning up half of the population' or not, but the aristocracy and the powerful bourgeoisie not only realises that 'fire of the dragon', but even start to fear of also dying scorched (and the power with them). So, ¬øwhat do they do to prevent that? ¬øDemocracy maybe? What the fuck are you saying, give power to mere horses, that's insane. ¬øWhat do they do in the series? The power is now in the hands of the 3 Eyed Raven, that's the best option because he knows what mankind is able to do and due to that he can avoid misery, hungry, wars...it sounds utopian, ¬ødoesn't it?

*Crows are all liars.*¬†It is obviously not true that since the feudalism we haven't evolved as society and we certainly have much more welfare. But with the French Revolution (mostly) the bourgeoisie saw the flames and created another system with crumbs of democracy and making sure they'll still have the power despite the throne is no longer existing because it has been melted by the people. ¬øWhat link have Bran in all of this? He is the keeper of the establishment, he is the manipulation of the power on the citizens, he is the mass media, he is the one that ensure that everyone is in its proper position. Jon has to be there, Tyrion has to be there, everyone has to be where they are because is the right thing for the power, because they are all their puppets.

*I will see if I can find him (Drogon).* He will of course, it was always his duty and will always find us, the people. If there are traces of new sparks he will pull the correct strings to stifle them. Of course there is not impossible to try to change that fact, revolution is always a possibility and the real power of the people might not be an utopia, nevertheless a raven will forever diagnose it and fight against that. Power is really powerful and chaos is a ladder.

We have to live in that system like marionettes in the illusionist's hands. ¬øIs there another way of living, is there actual freedom? Yes, beyond The Wall, but there are monsters yonder and it's very cold and isolated, the most you can expect if you adventure there is wretchedness and death. And if you're not in this side of the wall in the system they've established for you, Winter is coming.

**TL;DR: Power will always do whatever it takes to keep the power. From feudalism tyrants fighting for the Iron Throne (symbol of power) to low levels of democracy and better welfare, the establishmet with the 3ER as its manipulating and master keeper will always remain in the same hands. Bran is always going to find flames of the dragons raising in the society and, pulling the strings, he will always try and succeed to mitigate them.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, sorry for possible grammatical mistakes, the english isn&amp;#39;t my common language.&lt;/p&gt;

The camera pans over King's landing. The city is beautiful, with marble streets and an Ancient Roman aesthetic.  People are happy in the streets. There is a statue or Bran on a horse, made of gold. 

You see the city gates open and a procession of North Men, with a horse drawn Carriage. It rolls into the Red Keep. 

""All hail Queen Sansa Stark, queen of the northern realms.""

Sansa steps out, beautiful. Two small children run out behind her... she is a mother. Her knights escort her into the castle. 

Midday:
You see Sansa preparing her quarters with her handmaidens, when... Tyrion walks in. Sansa sends her Handmaidens out.

Tyrion: (Bows and kisses Sansa's hand) Queen Stark. You are more radiant than ever. A glass of wine?

(Sansa nods)

T: Your brother has done quite the reconstruction here. Our city has never seen better days since.  He grew the gold reserve, and our city has seen a prosperous era.

S: Lord Lannister. You and Bran have done an amazing service to this city, it's people, and Westeros. But the North does not forget the service you have provided us. Our people are grateful for your trade. The South isn't the only thing that has grown, however. 

T: Yes... the northern Kingdoms ar... 
(Sansa interrupts).

S: No Tyrion. I am not talking about the North. I am talking about the Children.

(Suddenly the two children run into the room playing. One is a boy with dark blonde hair 5 years,  the other a girl with brown hair, 3 years).

Girl: Father! (She runs and hugs him. The boy is adamant and reserved.)

S: Robb, greet your father. 

Robb: Father... (He also hugs Tyrion. Tyrion kisses both on the forehead.

T: Robb, Leanna, I have missed you so! (He pulls them into and holds them close and tight. Now he understands the cost and price Cersei would pay to defend her children)

The scene changes, later in the day, Sansa walks into Bran's room. He is staring out the window in his wheelchair, with Sansa at the door way.

Bran (monotonous and cold): I am sorry to keep Tyrion away from you and your children. But he has been detrimental in our effort to restore our people.

S: No, I understand the ploy. Plus, I don't think the Northern Lords would appreciate Tyrion Lannister gallavanting through the streets of Winterfell. It's too soon, still.

B: Yes, the North never forgets...

S: Have you heard from Arya? At all??

B: No... not since the day we went our ways.

S: And Jon?

B (Still gazing into the distance): No... 

Brienne walks in.

Brienne: Queen Sansa. (She bows)

Sansa: Ser Brienne. Will you be joining us for the celebration?

Brienne: I can not promise you, your highness. Though we have come so far, we still toil in the daily dealings of a city's crimes. And with Lord Bronn as our chief of coin (She sighs), our funding seems to lose a few coin to... the undesired.

Sansa looks down and nods.

S: Well I wish you good luck on your duties.

Transition to nightly reveries. 

People are dancing. Tyrion is dancing with Leanna. Sansa watches and smiles. Robb is brooding. Bran is sitting and watching, silently.  

Later on he is wheeled away, down a dark lonely walk way, facing the sea. He is left alone. He wargs.

Crows flying above the sea. 

You see a ship. Arya, but as we get closer, the ship is wrecked on an island.

I could have used some depth tying everything together and incorporating the fantasy elements the writers decided to punt by Episode 3.  For instance, they could have blown everyone's minds with the Bran/3ER/Lord of Light theory with a 3-4 minute narrative by King Bran/3ER and a compilation of flashbacks showing him influencing the past and present throughout the story. Example:

&amp;#x200B;

Bran attends his first small council meeting (instead of the ridiculous dialogue we got about brothels and ships).... He narrates about the evils of men that he's observed over the millenia.  He explains that men are inherently good, but inevitably turn evil if left to their own device and rule, something the Children of the Forest learned long ago, though their experiment went terribly wrong and required intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenes show him moving pieces into place to plan for the Long Night:

&amp;#x200B;

Bran standing next to Aerys on the throne whispering in his ear just before Jamie slays him...

&amp;#x200B;

Bran standing next to Varys by a fire, whispering in his ear/same with Melisandre

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow showing influence of Thoros/Beric/Jon Snow....etc...

&amp;#x200B;

The narration continues that there is good in the hearts of men, but the draw of power can corrupt even the purest hearts (replay Jon holding Dany with a knife in her chest, scene of Drogon melting the iron throne - maybe close-up of Drogon's eyes showing Bran is warging into him at that moment would have been cool and provided some explanation why Jon wasn't roasted or eaten on the spot).

&amp;#x200B;

Bran continues with his narrative, even subtedly alluding to his plans to become ruler of the realm, that he's not Bran anymore, but the 3ER, as the characters go their seperate ways...He tells that council that Winter has gone.....for now (Jon, now deep in the north, sees a spiral pattern - we're left wondering if it's an old pattern from the NK, or a new one).  He continues that ""The time has come to rebuild. To start anew.  To dream of a better world.  To dream of Spring""   Theme music plays...Roll credits.

This will be a theory about the ending of The Song of Ice and Fire (the book) after watching the whole season 8 of GoT. After Arya struck down the Night‚Äôs King a thought came to my mind ‚Äì the Night‚Äôs King was interpreted as a main antagonist of the series the whole time ‚Äì but turned out to be just a pawn. So who‚Äôs the real antagonist now? Cersei? It would be too easy for GRRM.

Some important information before you start reading my crazy theories:

\- I‚Äôve read somewhere that from season 4 onwards GRRM was not involved in the production of the TV show ‚Äì the creators took too many liberties with characters fates in the show, most importantly they completely ommited Lady Stoneheart ‚Äì she‚Äôll probably have an important role to play in the prophecies. So, probably, without all those characters, prophecies wouldn‚Äôt have made much sense in the show.

\- Also there was a rumor that GRRM revealed key points to the show‚Äôs creators about the ending ‚Äì but not the whole ending. He‚Äôs also said that the ending of the show may be a bit different than a book. And the most important part of the Game of Thrones conclusion is the fact that Bran takes the Iron Throne.

\- You can search the internet for some basis of the conclusions that I make, since I don‚Äôt have a time to bother with copying/pasting prophecies and such.

\- Note that english is not my native language.

So here‚Äôs my wild theory:

Azor Ahai and Prince That Was Promised are separate entities ‚Äì Azor Ahai may not even be one person, but a group of people. People of Westeros try to connect the visions into coherent story, but fail.

The Azor Ahai prophecy about Lightbringer refers to Cersei (that would be the twist worthy of GRRM ‚Äì since she‚Äôs one of the main antagonists and nobody would have thought she'll be Azor Ahai, the savior).

A Legend of Lightbringer main point is: Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero‚Äôs sword and he needed to do it three times. An important part of prophecies is the fact that the language in which they were written (or spoken, whatever) can be interpreted in multiple ways (as in we don‚Äôt know if The Prince That Was Promised is male or female).

Azor Ahai is Cersei. The Lightbringer (the flaming sword/or in my interpretation the flaming weapon) is Wildfire. Azor Ahai works for days and nights until the sword is done (as in the production of the Wildfire before the battle).

First time the sword is tempered in water ‚Äì this section refers to Battle of Blackwater (the first time Wildfire was used by Cersei).

Second time Azor Ahai captures the Lion and drives the sword into its heart. This refers to the episode where Cersei captures Tommen (a Lion since he‚Äôs a Lannister and also a King) and breaks his heart when she blows up the Septon with Margaery inside it. She caused him such pain that he‚Äôs commited suicide (and the suicide of Tommen is not just a simple moment of character‚Äôs death that surprises us for the sake of surprise ‚Äì it‚Äôs an important event that enables us to connect Cersei to the prophecy about the Lightbringer).

The third time Azor Ahai drove the sword into a breast of his wife Nissa Nissa ""while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon"". We don‚Äôt see the third usage of a Wildfire in the show, but maybe it will be used in the books by Cersei while fighting for King‚Äôs Landing. I guess Nissa Nissa may be Jaime, since valyrian language doesn‚Äôt differentiate genders (as in Nissa Nissa may mean lover or something, not wife exactly). Everyone focuses that Prince may be Princess, but not on the fact that Azor Ahai may be female.

I guess that driving the sword is metaphorical in this case also. Maybe Cersei will kill Tyrion on purpose somehow using Wildfire. Jaime may be in ecstasy because their child is born, but he‚Äôs also in anguish since Tyrion dies. Maybe he‚Äôs changed in the books and wanted peace after the death of Night‚Äôs King, but Cersei blew up something with Wildfire. I guess that Cersei‚Äôs pregnancy is an important part of the ecstasy piece of the prophecy \[Aga\].

So - that sets things into motion, maybe the third use of Wildfire triggers Daenerys - the Mad Queen and she burns the whole King‚Äôs Landing. Some things happen and Bran becomes King of Seven Kingdoms.

But Bran is a Three-Eyed Raven now, not Bran Stark, as he repeatedly says in the show. It‚Äôs completely ignored in the show, as well as a side-plot of the Children of the Forest. But in this book, as we‚Äôve seen before, nothing is written without a purpose. And the main purpose of this story is to troll us, as well as showrunners. Book won‚Äôt end on the events of the last episode.

When Bran meets the Three-Eyed Raven in the show, he‚Äôs just a random old guy. But in the books the Three-Eyed Raven is a specific person ‚Äì Lord Bloodraven ‚Äì a Targaryen Lord Commander of the Night‚Äôs Watch and the Master of Whisperers. The Master of Whisperers part is important. One quote from the wiki says: ""How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? the riddle ran. A thousand eyes, and one. Some claimed the King's Hand was a student of the dark arts who could change his face, put on the likeness of a one-eyed dog, even turn into a mist"". It implies that Lord Bloodraven was a warg/skinchanger. He was also of a royal family. He's disappeared behind The Wall and he is found by Bran after 100 years or something like that, in any case, he should be dead by now because of his old age.

And this is foreshadowing that the Children also await for a Prince That Was Promised. They took Lord Bloodraven for THE Prince since he's a skinchanger and a royal. They connected him to the roots of a weirwood tree, but nothing impactful happened. I have a hunch that the Three-Eyed Raven (whoever Three-Eyed Raven is, maybe it's the last greenseer of the Children of the Forest with powers to warg into other human beings) stole the body of Lord Bloodraven, killing him in the process. It's hard to guess since there are no rules of magic explicitly stated. Also Leaf (this one Child of the Forest that speaks with Bran) tells Bran that they've created the Night's King to protect themselves from human race. So why should they help Bran - a human being - to destroy the Night's King and save humanity? The Night's King purpose was to destroy humanity, but something went wrong and he also attacked Children of the Forest. I think the Children of the Forest have their own agenda, and are not just a peaceful race who wants to repair the mistakes of the past - it would be too cliche for GRRM and this dark world where no one is just.

Okay, so the Bran comes into the cave and his education begins. The Three-Eyed Raven states to Bran that the past can't be changed. But Bran is disobedient and interferes with the past. Three-Eyed Raven sees that young Eddard Stark somehow hears Bran's screams during one of the visions and realizes that he can influence the past by leaving messages to people. Maybe before Bran's visit, past couldn't be changed since Bran is THE Prince born with the powers to influence the past (also the magic is strong during times of Game of Thrones events and it manifestes itself by a fact that dragons were reborn, red comet fell from the sky etc.).

After some time Night's King finds the Three-Eyed Raven and strikes him down. I guess this is the time when Three-Eyed Raven takes the body of Bran, killing him in the process. And so Bran is not really Bran anymore - he's a Three-Eyed Raven and he ""lives mostly in the past now"" as he says when speaking to Tyrion after Battle of Winterfell. He travels to past leaving visions and messages to people to influence their behavior so that he can become a King. All those visions, miracles and religions of Westeros are interpretation of Three-Eyed Raven's messages.

So we've come to a conclusion: Three-Eyed Raven influences the past to become a King. But why? He's influenced the past, revived people who were important in his plan and now rules the 7 Kingdoms. The actions he can take in the past are very limited, he can't travel into the past, but he can (probably by trial-and-error) influence the past events to become a King. Now he has direct influence on the fate of the world.

I've also read somewhere that GRRM planned a large ""jump"" in the timeline of the book. I think this ""jump"" would come at the end of the book. Bran/Three-Eyed Raven the King leads humanity into big conflict (like Westeros vs Essos in scale). There's also unresolved plot of greyscale disease (the one that Jorah Mormont had - the friendzoned-bodyguard of Daenerys - that turned skin into stone). I think something like a world war and outbreak of this disease would severely weaken humanity as a whole race. Also note that in the book there are many hints that Children of the Forest are not actually extinct and some of them may live on the Isle of Faces, which can't be reached by any human. And so we come to the conclusion of the book.

Prince That Was Promised is Bran ‚Äì but he wasn‚Äôt promised to human race to save them from the Night‚Äôs King. He was promised to Children of the Forest to save them from human race (since humans slaughtered Children of the Forest and almost drove them to extinction).

The Prince That Was Promised will ""bring the end to the darkness"" or ""will bring the new dawn"", something akin to that - can't find this prophecy now. So the darkness that the Prince will end is not the Night's King. The darkness is humanity that drove Children of the Forest to near extinction. With humanity weakened Bran/TER has an occassion to strike one final blow to humanity. He uses his one left dragon (who can kill lots of people in very short timespan - watch the last episode). Maybe he uses newly created Night's King/Queen (there was a leak before the last episode that Daenerys is killed by a Dragonglass blade and her eyes turn blue, then she is taken by Drogon beyond the Wall - this event wasn't in the last episode, but maybe it was just cut from the script, since ending GoT on a cliffhanger would be a bad move for the producers).

So using Fire (the dragon) and the Ice (the Night's Queen) Three-Eyed Raven/Bran/King destroys humanity. Then on the ashes of the world built by humans, he makes a place for the remaining Children of the Forest to rebuild their civilization. The main antagonist of the book isn't Night's King or Cersei. It is human race as a whole.

And that would be the ending. Everyone you know dies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theory about the book ending, after the end of the tv show.&lt;/p&gt;

Mostly reshoots of 'ending' under lies that they're fake alternates, flashbacks with other actors that mysteriously were in leaks but never in the episodes we've seen, and reveal of the truest Azor Ahai, Littlefinger, returning with a proper plan, from Bravvos.

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 6 (perhaps much more) was Bran's Dream of Spring. Inconsistencies and dream logic coming to a head, mix of truth, memory, and hopeful falsehood, sleeping at the Isle of Faces, where it all began, all to cover up the terrible reality of Winter. He is the world's memory, and now we know so dearly what will be lost if the Three Eyed Raven finally loses it all. Everyone's hopeful recording of what they dearly wish for themselves, for the world, all within a framework they could share. Dying as a man who protected his queen. Sailing to the reaches beyond Westeros, like the wishes had when a younger and more innocent girl. Becoming the Queen of the North, bowing to no one any longer. Finding freedom, true freedom, in the North, the real, true North. The desire for the most riches possible, but the secret desire to have recognition of one's talents and usefulness with it. Flying off with your children back home, away from a place that does not want you. Or burning them alive, the ungrateful. Or sailing away, to an island region that will finally bring you peace. Becoming Grand Maester in the span on weeks, finally recognized for your intelligence and insight you bring. The snow thawing and life springing anew from the ground.

With each episode, the situation becomes more unreal, and more of a strange push against the tide of what we understand to be the brutality of Westeros and the supernatural threats it faces. It has truth, and most events likely truly happened in a similar sense, but by the end, it is rather preposterous. But Bran had to survive to remember, to record these dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

When you have greensight, or rather for the show, the powers of the Three Eyed Raven - you can have dreams of what hasn't happened, though sometimes it does. To paraphrase Meera Reed (books).

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe an unlikely hero can come to help avert this failed present. Maybe we can succeed the dream of spring.

My opinion: Battle at Kings Landing

Firstly the battle for Winterfell and the battle for King's Landing should have been swapped. 

Rhaegal never should have died in the scene with Euron. It never should have taken place.

Jon destroys the golden companies fleet on the back of Rhaegal while Dany goes mad and starts burning Kings Landing with Drogon.

Jon flys back and witnesses her rampage and tries to stop her. A dragon battle ensues over Kings Landing but Jon and Rheagal are over powered by Drogons immense size. Jon is dismounted and Rheagal is wounded and flies North. 

Jon and Tyrion are imprisoned for treason.

Dany enters the throne room. But not with Jon but with Sir Jorah. Dany gives the same speech. minus the romance. He remains emotionless. Dany gets closer to ask why. He stabs her in the heart. Drogon awakens to find Danys body. Jorah backs away standing in front of the throne. Drogon burns both Jorah and the throne simultaneously.

Whats left of the Dathraki and unsullied agree to go fight in the North since the NK is the real threat to humanity and Jon snow is the last remaining Targaryen and the blood of Dany.

Jon and Tyrion are released

Everything essentially remains the same. The Hound, Jamie, Cersie, The Mountain, Jorah and Dany's arcs are complete.

The battle for Winterfell:

Essentially everything can remain the same but with these previous character arcs being over I feel that it would have opened up more time for the survivors story arcs to be completed.

The Dothraki's forces still would have charged after having The Red Priestess ignite their swords. But it should have been explained that THEY LET THEIR OVER CONFIDENCE AFTER THE SWORDS WERE IGNITED IN FACT GIVE THEM A FALSE SENSE OF SAID CONFIDENCE. There was a REALLY easy way to do this. All Jon or whomever was in charge of the Dothraki assault had to say was: ""No wait! Why are you charging?! Stop!"" This would completely exonerated that whole situation in my eyes.
 
The battle ensues in the same way minus Dany. Jon rides Rheagal solo. Drogon left with Danys body.

Bran still waits in the weirwood with Theon.

A dragon battle commences between the NK and Jon. At some point Jon and the NK are dismounted by eachother. Rheagal dies. The NK falls in the courtyard with Bran. Jon falls in the courtyard with Viserion.

Jon manages to climb the back of Viserion in some epic way and kills Viserion with Longclaw.

Right before the NK executes Bran, Jon enters the courtyard. A battle between Jon and the NK commence ultimately with Jon being stabbed in the heart with the NK's blade. Right before the NK executes Jon Arya jumps from behind in the same fashion. She stabs the NK in the heart killing him. The dragonglass shard that placed into the NK's chest falls on the ground. 

Bran looks at Jon and says ""Now you have to choose.""
 
They place the shard in Jons chest saving his life in the same way the COTF saved Uncle Benjins. 

Jon goes North of the wall with Thormund, Ghost and the wildlings in the same fashion. But not because of banishment. Because he requests that the wall be rebuilt and the magic barriers returned (which Bran has learned how to do through visions) to ensure the safety of the realm of men. Jon can't live South of the wall.

The Wildlings choose to go North with Jon to start a new Kingdom. Jon is essentially the new Night King. But for the living not for the dead.

Now they can insert their LOTR ending and it wouldnt have felt so mundane.

Overall, I'm content with the ending. It is not the best ending in the world, an achievement incredibly hard to perform, but the expectations we had on this ending are our own. I sincerely believe, they did the best that they could. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my idea is based on a couple of things:

1. Minimal change from what we have seen in season 8. Meaning as little of extra filming possible required but still have major impact to the series.
2. An idea to have more time go by in season 8 without adding more episodes or seasons. All you Dany going full Targaryen came out of nowhere folks could appreciate this.

&amp;#x200B;

After the killing of the Night King, Dany has her eyes set on King's Landing. When traveling to Dragonstone, it appears that the Lanninster forces along with the Golden Company has destroyed Dragonstone. Green flames are seen from a far. While concerned and distracted,they are ambushed by Euron and Rhaegal is shot down. Not perfect but more satisfaction from the why didn't Dany see Euron crowd. Dany and forces retreat but not without heavy casualties. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, my idea. A time skip 2-3 years later. A la Breaking Bad and Avengers: Endgame, a time skip provides a ""cushion"" if you will, of reasonable doubt when talking about character development. Why did Walter White show back up in New Mexico? The time skip drove him to that. How did Hulk manage to be tamed and became Smart Hulk? The time skip drove him to that. These ""implied"" developments are quickly filled in with dialogue thus saving time for larger events.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional ideas for after the time skip? A slow presumed distance developing between Dany and Jon, perhaps having the Golden Company get the better of Dany's army strategically, and I personally picture a large fight at the Twins and at the Trident. Similar to Robert's Rebellion. Nevertheless, the time skip for me would be instrumental to drive Dany's distrust, paranoia, and conflict in her peaceful strategy to conquering. Now imagine Cersei and Jaime together again in the dragon room of the Red Keep trying to escape as the walls and ceilings around them are collapsing, all while holding their child.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the series is over and there are no more theories I figured this could be a good place to post a slight difference in this season that could have made a lot of sense and helped out the plot.

&lt;p&gt;- Why did we not see Meera Reed one last time? Leaf even tells her in season 4: &amp;quot;Brandon Stark needs you. He will not always be in this place (the 3ER Cave) and he will need you.&amp;quot; Does Meera remain with the crannogmen? Does she eventually become the lady of house Reed? Where did she go?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who did the Catspaw dagger originally belong to?&lt;br/&gt;
-The catspaw dagger is highlighted as a very important piece of weaponry throughout the show. The writers make a point of having the dagger make its way from person to person to finally come into the hands of Arya Stark to kill the nightking. Bran even says at one point &amp;quot;do you know who this belonged to?&amp;quot; &amp;amp; we never find out who it DID belong to!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can some of you fellow nerds help me understand better where Meera Reed comes into play, &amp;amp; who the catspaw dagger originally belonged to?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the show is over these are the two only large issues i have with the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

I never really was Team Dany. But I always cheer on her, thinking that she has had that potential to be the Queen of The Realm. Yes, we are shown that she could be impulsive. But she was also willing to listen to her good advisors; Jorah, Ser Barristan, Varys (i‚Äôm a bit skeptical about Tyrion tho, since he‚Äôs a Lannister and he could always make a u-turn to his family) 

Now at this point, it makes me wonder. What if Jon never bend the knee. In S7Ep6, Dany had already willing to fight in Jon‚Äôs war against the dead, after seeing them for herself, (and she probably already falling in love for Jon‚Äôs honourable character).  

Had Jon not bent the knee;
- Dany could have Jon/North as her biggest ally, having mutual benefit in helping each other‚Äôs war
- Stark sisters/north folks won‚Äôt feel too insecure abt Dany and her army since their arrival to Winterfell. This could save Dany from her insecurities and the start of her power hunger and madness. As much as I want them to work together, I kinda understand Sansa‚Äôs reluctance to accept Dany. I believe Jon bending the knee just made the situation difficult
- Jon/North could help Dany with winning the great war against Cersei, but in the end bargain with her to keep the North independent. Dany as the Queen of Six Kingdoms, Jon/Sansa as the King/Queen of the North 
- Most importantly, Dany won‚Äôt have to die. She has been fighting for the throne all her life, and she did it trying hard to be different from her father and other ancestors. Jon being revealed as having claim to but not wanting the throne caused the situation to be complicated for Dany. 

I am new to GoT and I know the storyline has been shaped and heavily referenced to the earlier prophecies, legends etc, (like Targaryen will always have that fire &amp; blood within them, Starks as the honourable house)

But I was hoping that maybe, in a twist of event, the ending could be different than what the earlier prophecy hinted. I mean, we are introduced to a Targaryen girl, who wants to rule the Kingdom as a better person than her ancestors, a Lannister who doesn‚Äôt want to be affiliated with the dirty tricks his family did, and Jon the bastard who is selfless. These heroic characters in the end, did not get the fair ending they deserved (except Tyrion who did treason for a few times, but still manage to be a Hand?)

The night before the final episode I had a dream that I was Jon and holding Daenarys close and from the depth of my heart was crying as I said I love you and stuck my sword into her heart. Lo' and behold, that is exactly what the show tried to portray at her end. I knew that was going to be the ending as they had painted themselves into the position where Daenarys had to be killed. When watching that scene it was emotional but not like in my dream.

All the above being as it is, and being necessary and fitting at this junction, it still has the end of this show leaving me feeling empty. There is so much that was built up and made relevant as we go back to earlier seasons or the books, that just became nothing. I feel cheated in that we were promised a story with various fantasy elements only to have them forgotten about or discarded with not much thought to get to an ending that could have occurred without all these apparently unnecessary elements.

Just consider these various elements that were built up and played so much into the mythology of the story only to end up being nothing...

The Doom of Valyria - this is a story that underlies the founding of the House of Black and White, the history of the Targaryens, and deals with magic in general, yet we get no resolution as to this.

The Weather - Weather in Westeros is majorly messed up with seemingly strong magical effects... Yet nothing.

The Long Night - How did the children and men beat the Night King the first time. Why was he still around? Killing him is apparently pretty easy.

The Wall - A magical construct that was easily destroyed by the Night King. Further, apparently had the dragons (and Jon and his group) never gone north in the first place the Night King would be standing around by a wall looking stupid still.

The House of Black and White - Were they nothing more than a plot device to train Arya into knife-fighting? Was it really necessary. Do they serve any bigger purpose?

Varys - What was the voice he heard in the fire. That red priestess knew.

The Lord of Light - People are resurrected, swords turn aflame, and for what? Next to nothing. Were these people resurrected so special that the Lord of Light needed them to be resurrected.

Jon's heritage - It is nothing more than a plot device to cause conflict between him and Daenary... So is Bran a master-plotter here? If yes, why not bring that out better.

The 3ER - Is he just a history book or does he do things?

Grey Scale - A seemingly mystical disease that turns out to be a simple contagious skin infection.

There  is more I can add. Does it matter. Instead of getting a fantasy story that makes these things relevant in resolving it, they all end up being elements we spend so much time on, only to have it tossed back in our face as not really part of the story. If this was the desired outcome, perhaps reducing the import of these mythical elements earlier on would have helped.

Not just are the fantasy elements poorly dealt with, we also get the human element messed up. Daenary got a horrible treatment. We needed more time to experience the choices and steps that lead to burning a city that surrendered with a million souls in it. Instead the elements are rushed. They are there as so many others have noted, but they are poorly written and her turn to genocidal maniac ends up feeling forced.

This is an issue for other characters as well, but Dany being so central to the story, it is just inexcusable.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel numb. The night before the final episode I had a dream that I was Jon and holding Daenarys close and from the depth of my heart was crying as I said I love you and stuck my sword into her heart. Lo&amp;#39; and behold, that is exactly what the show tried to portray at her end. I knew that was going to be the ending as they had painted themselves into the position where Daenarys had to be killed. When watching that scene it was emotional but not like in my dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above being as it is, and being necessary and fitting at this junction, it still has the end of this show leaving me feeling empty. There is so much that was built up and made relevant as we go back to earlier seasons or the books, that just became nothing. I feel cheated in that we were promised a story with various fantasy elements only to have them forgotten about or discarded with not much thought to get to an ending that could have occurred without all these apparently unnecessary elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just consider these various elements that were built up and played so much into the mythology of the story only to end up being nothing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doom of Valyria - this is a story that underlies the founding of the House of Black and White, the history of the Targaryens, and deals with magic in general, yet we get no resolution as to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weather - Weather in Westeros is majorly messed up with seemingly strong magical effects... Yet nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Night - How did the children and men beat the Night King the first time. Why was he still around? Killing him is apparently pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall - A magical construct that was easily destroyed by the Night King. Further, apparently had the dragons (and Jon and his group) never gone north in the first place the Night King would be standing around by a wall looking stupid still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House of Black and White - Were they nothing more than a plot device to train Arya into knife-fighting? Was it really necessary. Do they serve any bigger purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varys - What was the voice he heard in the fire. That red priestess knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord of Light - People are resurrected, swords turn aflame, and for what? Next to nothing. Were these people resurrected so special that the Lord of Light needed them to be resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon&amp;#39;s heritage - It is nothing more than a plot device to cause conflict between him and Daenary... So is Bran a master-plotter here? If yes, why not bring that out better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3ER - Is he just a history book or does he do things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grey Scale - A seemingly mystical disease that turns out to be a simple contagious skin infection.&lt;/p&gt;

After the Three Eyed Raven died he focused on killing Bran and solely Bran, even according to the stupid badly written show. He wanted to kill the Three Eyed Raven. Not because of Sam's stupid ass explanation, but because Bran was the true villain. Now, we've heard this theory before, Bran being evil, but perhaps Bran was so evil in fact that after he got the throne, he would have destroyed the little elfy thingies beyond the wall and the Night King, having a purpose to prevent that from happening, went south. Think about it, why did no one die during the Night King battle? It's because the Night king only send his zombies to delay the others whilst he got to Bran. All these shots of 20 zombies attacking Sam and you thinking ""he's surely dead"" actually make sense because the Night King isn't evil. He doesn't wanna kill anybody and that's why almost no one died. He just wanted to get Bran before his evil plan came true. That's why they didn't say anything to each other, they both knew what was going on, but because of Arya's invisibility spell, the Night king lost.

Then Bran went to King's Landing, mind controlled Daenerys into becoming mad and Jon killed Daenerys (as expected). Then there was this voting meeting and Bran obviously won by mind controlling the senators and installing his First Galactic Empire. He did not kill Jon because that would have started a war with the northeners while his kingdom was still weak and he would have lost all his power. Instead he sent Jon to be a Watcher on the Wall which made no sense cuz there is nothing to defend against now, but Jon did lose his right to the throne that way, which Bran very much enjoys after he intends to install a bloody dictatorship or burn the seven kingdoms to the ground, along with the elfy thingies.

Why did he let Sansa get her kingdom? Cuz he knows he can destroy her eventually, he just can't do it now. He needs to mind control the dragon and build an army first.

So yea, plot armor, night king lack of plot, bran not saying anything, bran becoming king, everything makes sense if you think about him mind controlling his way to victory.

Also, why do you think he let 1 dragon be shot by Euron's stupid ass fleet and he didn't tell anyone that it was around the corner? Because he can't mind control 2 dragons at the same time - he only needs 1 and he picked the largest one.

But... why Bran? He doesn't strike us as evil does he? He was just some kid. Yes... Because Bran is not Bran at all. It is the original old Three Eyed Raven who took his body to prolong his immortality. Bran is dead. The Three Eyed Raven is the true villain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

edit1: also, The Three Eyed Raven only deleted Bran's memories and installed his, so he isn't exactly himself, but rather a copy of himself, like some sci-fi story stuff.

The real problem is the (lack of) buildup to all of the character conclusions. Also, the episode itself is (AGAIN) full of plot holes and inconsistency. Let's look at each of the main characters in turn:

Danaerys. This is what mostly ruined the ending. There were no signs of any 'madness' before her sudden turn to torch the city last episode. Yes, she made threats but never suggested anything that would hint she would go on to kill thousands of civilians. For everyone she executed, she had good reason. And so, her death feels meaningless because her character was not believable any more. We either needed more time to appreciate her transformation into this evil villain or they should have started her turn a lot earlier than Episode 4/6 in the Final Season!

Because Danaery's turn seems so unrealistic, everything else feels empty because her sudden turn to madness is central to everyone else's plot.

Jon had to kill her, no doubt. But I did not feel anything in that moment. It was expected but I did not know who Danaerys was anymore, she certainly wasn't the person I watched grow over the past 7 years. If you can't understand a character, their death will have no impact and that's exactly what happened here.

This brings me to Jon Snow. There is nothing special about his character that meant it had to be him to kill Danaerys. Arya could have easily done it or Tyrion, Davos, Varys etc. It doesn't make sense to resurrect Jon for this reason. It's poetic since they were lovers but that's about it. It was always hinted that Jon had a greater purpose - to destroy the Night King. He fought him beyond the wall, they knew each other. It seemed like they had some kind of deeper connection. Arya killing the Night King felt cheap and unwarranted. Jon has just become a puppet, being used and pulled by everyone with no will of his own anymore. He even had to be manipulated by Tyrion to kill Dany.

Jon is sentenced to go back to the Night's Watch for killing Dany - here is the episode's biggest inconsistency. I don't understand why GreyWorm didn't execute Jon and Tyrion after they betrayed and killed his Queen. Grey-Worm was fiercely loyal and was seen butchering Lannisters at the start of the episode because he is getting rid of 'all enemies of Danaerys'. He would of course killed Jon and Tyrion instead of holding them hostage until foreign rulers arrived! Also, the Unsullied and Dothraki have no Leader, no allegiances to any other Ruler and their late Queen just declared war on the remaining 6 Kingdoms. So how are all these Leaders sitting and laughing in King's Landing as a council? It made no sense.

Also, why sentence Jon back to an organisation that has no purpose? The Night's Watch was meant to keep out the Wildlings and any other supernatural threat. The Wildlings are living inside the wall and the Night King is dead. Bran should have explained why we still needed the wall. I am therefore not ok with how this played out.

Bran's appointment felt strange to me. He's not in touch with his human side, why would he make a good ruler? His monotone voice and clinical language will draw no inspiration from the people or the armies. He has no charisma and has never been a Leader. However, Bran would be a perfect member of the council instead and with his unlimited knowledge, he would make an invaluable adviser to any King or Queen. I am not comfortable with him as King but meh, I can live with it.

Arya travels to see what is 'West of Westeros'. This was foreshadowed, she had no desire to be a 'Lady' and became completely independent.. She had shown this traveler's curiosity before so I'm OK with this.

Sansa rules the North, which is expected but I came to dislike her character the most (not sure if she's supposed to be hated or not). She basically plotted against Danaerys and betrayed Jon's trust to get Jon on the throne and is the main reason for the chaos in Kings Landing. She is the show's last biggest game player but she wins and is rewarded with her own Kingdom, separate from the rest. However, I think this selfishness would cause the other Rulers to want separation too? (especially Yara, who supported Dany) So I'm not sure how she got away with this.

Tyrion has been the most consistent character. Sure, his charm, wit and intelligence have suffered the past few seasons but there were no books to draw from. His motives were always clear, to see a fair ruler on the Iron Throne.

Bronne ends up on the council. A lowlife sell-sword whose loyalty switches like the wind. He talks of rebuilding brothels and is appointed Master of Coin. I didn't like this at all and Tyrion should have known better than to have a man like that in a position of influence. I thought we were building a better world?

Drogon destroys the Throne and ignores Jon because ( I presume) Jon is a Targaeryan and dragons don't target them? Anyways this is supposed to symbolize a new beginning, yet we still have a Dictator (King Bran) so this doesn't quite add up either.

In summary, the endings of the characters COULD have worked with further explanation and build-up. They made HUGE mistakes with Danaerys &amp; Jon's character. There are too many plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the last few seasons to be ignored and ultimately we end up with an unsatisfying Finale.

I view this series in two parts. Season 1-5 (mostly following the books) and Seasons 6-8 (show writers attempt).

You have to view the last few seasons with lower expectations because there is no rich source material to adapt from. They went for action at the cost of story and they could have gotten away with it if they had just been more careful. However, characters were unfairly destroyed (Dany, Jon, Jaime) for shock value and logic went out the window (just like Tommen did) for a lot of scenes. The quality in writing dropped too far and the whole story was damaged as a result.

It's a sad end to what could have been an epic masterpiece (up there with Lord of the Rings) and could have been watched by many future generations.

But how can you re-watch the series when you know half of the early character development and foreshadowing doesn't amount to anything?

All in all, it's been a great ride and I have witnessed some memorable moments, fantastic cinematography and incredible acting. But now, my Brothers and Sisters, my watch has ended and it's time to move on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some thought, I think the endgame of most of the character stories COULD have made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem is the (lack of) buildup to all of the character conclusions. Also, the episode itself is (AGAIN) full of plot holes and inconsistency. Let&amp;#39;s look at each of the main characters in turn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danaerys. This is what mostly ruined the ending. There were no signs of any &amp;#39;madness&amp;#39; before her sudden turn to torch the city last episode. Yes, she made threats but never suggested anything that would hint she would go on to kill thousands of civilians. For everyone she executed, she had good reason. And so, her death feels meaningless because her character was not believable any more. We either needed more time to appreciate her transformation into this evil villain or they should have started her turn a lot earlier than Episode 4/6 in the Final Season!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Danaery&amp;#39;s turn seems so unrealistic, everything else feels empty because her sudden turn to madness is central to everyone else&amp;#39;s plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon had to kill her, no doubt. But I did not feel anything in that moment. It was expected but I did not know who Danaerys was anymore, she certainly wasn&amp;#39;t the person I watched grow over the past 7 years. If you can&amp;#39;t understand a character, their death will have no impact and that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to Jon Snow. There is nothing special about his character that meant it had to be him to kill Danaerys. Arya could have easily done it or Tyrion, Davos, Varys etc. It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to resurrect Jon for this reason. It&amp;#39;s poetic since they were lovers but that&amp;#39;s about it. It was always hinted that Jon had a greater purpose - to destroy the Night King. He fought him beyond the wall, they knew each other. It seemed like they had some kind of deeper connection. Arya killing the Night King felt cheap and unwarranted. Jon has just become a puppet, being used and pulled by everyone with no will of his own anymore. He even had to be manipulated by Tyrion to kill Dany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon is sentenced to go back to the Night&amp;#39;s Watch for killing Dany - here is the episode&amp;#39;s biggest inconsistency. I don&amp;#39;t understand why GreyWorm didn&amp;#39;t execute Jon and Tyrion after they betrayed and killed his Queen. Grey-Worm was fiercely loyal and was seen butchering Lannisters at the start of the episode because he is getting rid of &amp;#39;all enemies of Danaerys&amp;#39;. He would of course killed Jon and Tyrion instead of holding them hostage until foreign rulers arrived! Also, the Unsullied and Dothraki have no Leader, no allegiances to any other Ruler and their late Queen just declared war on the remaining 6 Kingdoms. So how are all these Leaders sitting and laughing in King&amp;#39;s Landing as a council? It made no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, why sentence Jon back to an organisation that has no purpose? The Night&amp;#39;s Watch was meant to keep out the Wildlings and any other supernatural threat. The Wildlings are living inside the wall and the Night King is dead. Bran should have explained why we still needed the wall. I am therefore not ok with how this played out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran&amp;#39;s appointment felt strange to me. He&amp;#39;s not in touch with his human side, why would he make a good ruler? His monotone voice and clinical language will draw no inspiration from the people or the armies. He has no charisma and has never been a Leader. However, Bran would be a perfect member of the council instead and with his unlimited knowledge, he would make an invaluable adviser to any King or Queen. I am not comfortable with him as King but meh, I can live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya travels to see what is &amp;#39;West of Westeros&amp;#39;. This was foreshadowed, she had no desire to be a &amp;#39;Lady&amp;#39; and became completely independent.. She had shown this traveler&amp;#39;s curiosity before so I&amp;#39;m OK with this.&lt;/p&gt;

More notes about that ""Gathering of Lords""...


They knew there was no Night's Watch.¬† They also knew that the Unsullied/Dothraki would be clueless about that.¬† Apparently Jon was also.¬† They may have sent 2 Northman rando's dressed in black garb to escort him to the wall, knowing he would figure it out when he got there (or, as a last resort, have Tormund explain it to him using an elaborate puppet show).


Also speaking about the Lords, I find it funny that the people involved in that meeting, who happen to now be the rulers of the most powerful houses in Westeros, are also (most likely) the only people who would either vote for Bran automatically, or could be swayed by Tyrion to do so.¬† All of the elder members of their houses were either killed off systematically throughout the series, or died in battle.¬† Either way, it was by Bran's design that those specific people were the ones voting, and the vote was unanimous.¬†¬†


In short, through 3 eyed Raven powers and greensight, Bran made it so those Lords and ladies were the ones deciding the fate of the Kingdom...but he couldn't talk them into electing him king because he has no social skills (and may have wanted it to sound as if he wasn't interested in the position).¬† He needed Tyrion to do the nominating, the talking, and the swaying.¬† It all worked.¬† How I interpret the small council scene shows that Tyrion will tackle all the day to day duties, the politics, the ""game"", while Bran will not delve into that area much and instead take care of the larger ""celestial"" hazards, such as dragons, White Walkers, and other threats that 99% of the people don't realize exist to begin with.¬† I will finish this email with set of dialogue from the movie Men in Black:

Obviously the past couple of seasons alone of GOT have gotten closer to some background characters and delved deeper into their stories while taking some of our favorites and making their stories MUCH more important and altogether interesting. 

So without going into a massive why they should or shouldn't, but simply why it's a story that ready made for a spinoff, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it... Arya. 
This past season we've seen her years of training playoff as she's become a full blown badass. She's an interesting character with TONS of support. To say she's a fan favorite would be putting it lightly. 
She has plenty of unfinished storyline ready to-go: the faceless men alone could go on forvever. 
And they just put her on a boat. On a boat to go explore UNKNOWN TERRITORY. 

This shit practically writes itself. If you read up on the last person of note to go explore the area west where she's heading, she was another strong female character who stole some dragon eggs, bought a big badass ship with the money (may have stolen the dragon eggs back, or they may be the same ones Dany ended up with), and sailed west never to be seen again with the exception of some salty old dogs who swore they'd seen her ship. 
That's some serious high seas adventure ready to go for the ""Sea-Wolf"" (see, Arya has a damn fine pirates nickname ready to roll!). 

And you know, in later seasons when the story is running out of steam, it'll be super easy for the writers to ruin it by taking the strong independent female character they've spent so much time building up and forcing her into some sappy stories where Gendry is the love interest.

Seemed like people were pretty annoyed, heard people sayin it wasted their time etc and while i will admit im a casual fan that followed closest this last season but saw them all, liked S1 and 2 and then kinda watched it to watch it...anway...  


 

Okay, so im just gonna start with my two snipes from my post last week that i will eventually link/screenshot etc (mosty proud cuz im not a stan, i watched John Oliver and Killing Eve first haha and dont read the books but anyway) real quick:

\-i said the actual throne would be melted down/destroyed - called that (tho for bonus points i also said Gendry would be ordered to have it be melted down and turned into a roundtable type thing, which is very specific but im taking half points... which leads to my second snipe of sortts...

\-That there would be a group (i thought itd be smaller, one person per fam, but i said Sansa, Bran, Brienne, Gendry, Sam Tully and a fwe other would end up on a committee rather than Jon (though i totally thought Jon was gonna turn down the chance to rule rather then not have a chance after killing Dany) 

Okay now random thoughts:

\-It seems like its getting panned but i thought it was wayyy less divisive than The Sopranos or Lost as far as how poloarizing it was, mightve been a little safe but people saying a weak last season/couple eps  ruins almost a decade of a show they loved, and i liked enough, is silly to me

At least it was definitive like Breaking Bad's was (thats a masterclass right there) though i feel like we're just primed for spin offs with the huge unexplored parts of the map described as forest and jungle so dense its dark all the time and stuff and  new stuff hinted at

\-Pretty sure Bran was my final pick but ill have to check but im now confused over weather he has any power or its JUST Sansa - she just played such a small role in this season it seems weird...

\-Whats up with the 4th wall breaking 'The books called 'A Tale of Fire &amp; Ice' thing? I guess its funny they made fun of the title but it took me out of the episode - not something you should do to people in the last ten or so mins of a show thats in its 8th &amp; Final Seasons 6th and Final Episode...ya know?

\-I kinda liked that Jon was the one that knew he had to kill Dany but actually did it, and like in a super personal way - wasnt blown away shock-wise but i liked the decision...

\-I also liked Jons last scene even tho he ended up, sent/banished or whatever up north i love that he knows Wildlings and their way of life (and that was during the white walker winter not the foreshadowed spring seen here) and this is where he always seemed most comfortable - you'll also notice once he's through the gates up North you never see him in the Stark Samurai-bun that Arya, Ned - and last weeks Jon, was rocking (and me just sayin)  


\-very shocked at the lack of death in the finale - also to start, i totally thought it was Bran that Tyrion found in the rubble even when i paused it u could only see face then u see its Cercei and Jamie i was like 'wheeeeh""

Game of Thrones people (nothing finale related)...random theory...

What if Varys was a pedo all along??

\*Writing this just before watching GoT finale as it popped into my head so Spoilers up to S8E5 but not the finale\*

What if he groomed his 'little birds' (young girls) for that reason...If we found that out eventually i wouldnt be surprised for the reasons below but also because he died a horrific death and if he turn out to be a Pedo, we'll all see that killing in a different light...

As far as Varys=Pedo, regarding his castration/how he came a eunuch - idk if they showed it happen/aftermath but Varys may be saying he's castrated so that he's above suspicion of being a pedo:

He's also a master manipulator ( a trait many pedophies have, esp ones that groom long term etc) with the political power to get away with/cover up anything with his connections..

AND hes always got 'secrets with his little birds aka little girls' and secrets with adults is a HUGE red flag to watch for regarding grooming because its a way to test if they can keep a secret (as is mentioned a lot but recently in 'Leaving Neverland) etc - anyway, just a random throwaway theory i thought of just now  


\*BTW if they showed his castration in an episode/flasback or the scar etc in an earlier season and i just forgot then ignore all this, im not a DIE hard fan (even back in S's 3 and 4 i liked it enough to watch but its not in my top 10 all time shows for whats worth regardless of the finale) If thats the case let me know and my bad :/

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback to Daenerys Targaryen aboard her last dragon. We see her fighting the demons in her head as we hear the bells of King's Landing echo across the land.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dingggg!*

&amp;#x200B;

**""Burn them all.""** Dany hears whispers in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dingggg!*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*""Burn them all.‚Äù\*\*\*Dingggg!\***Burn them all!""**

&amp;#x200B;

*Dingggg!*

&amp;#x200B;

Dany's face slowly turns into one of fury. Why wouldn't she burn them all? No soul in this land trusts her anymore. She can't rule with love if nobody loves her. But...with fear. She can rule with fear. People will bow down to her because of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

**""BURN THEM ALL!‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

She lets it be fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Dany flies Drogon over King's Landing and does the unthinkable. She thinks of Missandei, Viserion, Rhaegal, her dead soldiers who fought for the lives of strangers who couldn‚Äôt care less about her. Warm tears run down her face.

As it all pours down, the warmth turns into heat, as she spoke the wretched word with all her might.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ÄúDracarys!‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

Flames. Everything and everyone down below, she burns them all.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick cut to Bran in Winterfell.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Burn them all!""** He whispers to himself.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Burn them all!""** His eyes are stiff at the back of his head.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ÄúBURN THEM AAAAALL!‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

A long pause. He breathes heavily and closes his eyes. A sinister smile slowly forms in Bran‚Äôs face.

The Targaryen girl has lost her way.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Cut back to present time at the Dragonpit.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ÄúI love you, little brother. I always will. You‚Äôll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard to ever kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

My dear sister Sansa has come a long way, too. The North is rightfully hers to keep. I nod.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ÄúAll hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.‚Äù**

If this is the end then the entirety of the story doesn't make any sense what so ever. I think there will be another long episode of this show, maybe next weekend, maybe later, I'm not sure. All I know is that non of what has happened makes sense and I think it makes much more sense that it was done on purpose, rather than everyone involved in the production and distribution of the biggest TV show ever just being wildly and hilariously incompetent storytellers and business people.

First speaking from a purely business standpoint, what the hell business sense does it make to end a fantasy series that has had overarching magical stories but then not mention any of those story lines in the last season and completely disregard magic, while also having a new series about the magical Age of Heroes and the Long Night come out within the next year or two.  It's going to be the real fans who were going to watch the Long Night series to begin with and if this is how it ends, there is no way they're going to be in on the Long Night series. Why would they be? Also, why would HBO actively piss off the hardcore  viewer base, the very same viewer base they would need to make the Long Night series successful. Doesn't add up, that's just terrible business.

From a story perspective, nothing with Tyrion's arc has been completed or has even mattered. His story has meant absolutely nothing if this is how it ends because he's done essentially nothing in regards to the narrative of the story. Tyrion has the most screen time, the most chapters, the longest chapters, but he has essentially done nothing in regards to the narrative of the story thus far. This doesn't make any sense. The episode opens with a close up of his face and we follow Tyrion for about 9 straight minutes, just seeing his perspective, but again, nothing happens with him. That's a lot of emphasis to put on one character who's essentially doing nothing, and has really done nothing meaningful in regards to the ""plot"" thus far.  There's a lot of Tyrion, Bran, and Sansa emphasis in this episode, especially considering they've essentially contributed nothing to the overall narrative of the story as it sits now, if this is how it truly ends. Nothing about any of this makes sense, including the rest of the story, if this is how it ends.

I didn't really start watching this show until 2016 but even before I started I knew that GOT had been the show that does things that no has done before, such as cutting of Ned Starks head in season 1, the Red Wedding (all very new for TV shows,) etc (wasn't told about these, was just told not to get attached to anyone before watching.) It would be very on brand for them to do a secret finale as no one has ever done that before. If there is one more episode at some point and it plays out somewhat like my previous posts have suggested, then everything in the story makes sense, as well as the business portion going forward.

I'm well aware of how insane this sounds but in all honesty, the idea that HBO (as well as AT&amp;T who just purchased HBO) and GRRM would just be fine with their incredibly valuable asset going to absolute shit when they are pouring money into a new series about the magical aspects of the show, while not mentioning the magical aspects of the series all season seems a million times more insane to me.  Hopefully I'm right with this and we're all left happy but if not, I am fine taking the L on this if this was just horrific storytelling and business sense, although I just don't see that scenario being likely as too many dollars can be generated from a great ending to this story, which is always the main goal.

Also, next Monday is a US holiday..........just sayin'

EDIT: So here is how I think it would end if my hypothesis of a surprise finale is correct. Lord of Light/future Bran is still warged into Drogon (possibly also Daenerys) after burning the city to make Tyrion turn against Daenerys, who then admits his often hinted at love for Daenerys (narratively this was useless at this point if this is how it ends.) Tyrion then seemingly convinces Jon to kill Daenerys which he does in a deceptive manner, something quite out character for the most honourable character alive on the show.  This could be explained as Jon is ""alive"" because he's being warged into and controlled by the Lord of Light/future Bran and this is how the series of events need to play out to reach the proper conclusion of Tyrion killing Bran (Endgame style time stuff.) Drogon then inexplicably just picks up Dany and flies wherever and we get no hint of an explanation where or why. I believe Drogon is flying to the Land of Always Winter with Dany and being controlled by warging future Bran. Dany will then become the Night Queen and the cycle will start again. Tyrion and Sansa are going to figure out that they need to kill Bran because he's the reason for this cycle, which is also the White Walkers purpose, killing Bran specifically, not just killing any 3 Eyed Raven. Night Queen Dany will be coming back with a dead army again to go after Bran to kill him as that is the WW's purpose. Tyrion will kill Night Queen Dany, fulfilling the Lightbringer prophecy, then with the Valyrian steel dagger will slit the throat of Bran, causing Jon to die as well as he no longer is being warged into.

I think Night Queen Dany makes sense with the foreshadowing from episode 1 of this season with the WW spiral symbol that got lit on fire that looked like the Targaryen sigil. I think these spiral symbols could be foreshadowing/prophecy of Dany needing to become NQ, or they could also be foreshadowing/prophecy strictly about Tyrion (if him being a Targaryen is true.) The other symbol, the non-spiral symbol that the WW's have left throughout the show, looks a lot like a Hand of the King pendant, which Tyrion is currently in possession of as he is Bran's HotK, something Bran was weirdly adamant about. I think this is forshadowing/prophecy of Tyrion's importance and him being the key to figuring out that killing Bran ends all of the madness. I'm unsure of how they would get the Valyrian Steel dagger from Arya, but I believe it will be the weapon to kill Bran.

I could very well be off my rocker here but as I said previously, I just feel like a scenario where the TV show whose claim to fame is misdirection and surprising the audience doing a surprise finale (something no one has ever done... what else could they do to surprise you at this point??? They made insanely real fire breathing dragons a thing that we don't even aww at anymore) and ending it in a fashion something like what I've described above where everything throughout the story actually makes sense is much more likely than HBO and D&amp;D taking a giant, steamy shit on the incredible world and story that they've brought to life. I also don't think that D&amp;D would just give the creative control of finishing the magical aspects of the story they brought to life (which have been the main part) to another team of people to do on a prequel series. That just doesn't seem likely to me.

Its something that feels like a 'could stand enough on its own' in the eyes of the creators, but really doesn't satisfy much of the viewer hunger for closure. I'm not saying that there will ever be a direct sequel (at least in the form of a show - sure media like show-setting novels, games, etc could be done like already with Telltale), but a get a HEAVY vibe that this setting isn't done yet. 'Sailing off into the West', this aint'... necessarily. Some things definitely ended - the 'Song of Ice and Fire' is a book written and closed.

-I think Sansa [and maybe Tyrion] might be the only main character to get a complete and fitting story arch, and no I'm not just saying that because she got a happy ending. From the very beginning all Sansa wanted was to be queen, she idolized Cersei and was desperate to please Joffrey until she found out what they were really like. She went through hell and grew from the spoiled rotten ""little bird"" into a strong woman who understood the cruelty of the world and would be a good ruler because of it. 
--But wouldn't that technically make Tyrion King of the North? They just glossed over the fact that Tyrion and Sansa are still married. Did they go through Westerosi divorce proceedings? Did being forced to marry Ramsey nullify their marriage? Are they just pretending that never happened? Again, glossed over...

The death of Dany
-First of all, Drogon trying to nudge her awake gave me PTSD flashback to Simba trying to wake Mufasa when he died in The Lion King. And I'm pretty sure he took her back to the place where Khal Drogo's funeral pyre was, where she hatched the dragons. 
--Loved that he melted the throne, if Dany couldn't have it, no one can. And it was fitting that there be no iron throne in the end, but it was just a chair... the position and power of the ""King"" didn't change, so it basically amounted to an emotional temper tantrum by a dragon.
---Jon shouldn't have been the one to kill Dany, it should have been something that Varys had done before she killed him that came back to bite her in the ass. But since it wasn't, what was the point of the letters he was writing and the little girl he was talking to? It feels like three more seasons of the show were left on the cutting room floor.
----What happens to all the places in Essos that were under Danys rule now?

Arya traveling the world
-This just doesn't fit, she did her traveling to Bravos, became a faceless man, decided "" it's not for me but thanks for the skills I need to finish off my hit list"". She comes back to Westeros to take out all the people that did her family wrong, comes to a crossroads between going to King's Landing and going home. She chose to go home. So now that the work is done, all her enemies are dead, her family is in control of the Six Kingdoms and the North, she decides to leave? Backpack around Europe for a while? She would have gone home and been a knight of the North.

Jon of the Night's Watch, again...
-He did his time at the wall, it's what he wanted at the beginning, he got it, got killed for it, came back to life and left. He was done with that part of his story, no way he should have been sent back. He should have gone beyond the wall by choice, not because he was sent there as punishment.
--So his true parentage, the big secret that Ned kept safe for decades, the big reveal with Bran at the Tower of Joy, meant nothing? Not that he wanted to be king and that wouldn't have been a fitting end to his story IMO. But it literally meant nothing, it may have meant something if he killed Dany because she was threatened by him and he feared for his life but he wouldn't have done that, he would have just let her kill him. He killed her because he knew she wouldn't stop trying to take over the world and massacring anyone she felt like including Tyrion, Sansa, Bran, Arya, Sam...
---I choose to believe he rode of into the woods and became a Wildling and never went back to the wall.

King Bran the Broken
-Did he say he couldn't be Lord of Winterfell because he was the 3ER? But he can be King?! He can't see the future but he pops off that line about ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" Was he orchestrating all of this to make himself king? Why would he? He was one of the few main characters that never had any interest in the throne. When he became the 3ER he didn't seem to have much interest in people at all anymore. So why would he want to rule them all? Simple answer he wouldn't and Bran as King makes no sense.
--Again, so all his abilities, spying on the past, interacting with the past, seeing everything that was and is, didn't end up meaning much. He did nothing during the battle with the Night King except sit there, he couldn't/didn't stop Dany's rampage, knowing Jon's parentage meant nothing. What was the point of the 3ER at all?

Hand of the King
-Again, King of the North? Yes? No? Maybe?
-While I would have liked to see Tyrion and Bronn turn Highgarden into the land of brothels and retire to spend the rest of their days playing drinking games, he was too smart and too good at the politics to end up anywhere else. He ended up where he belongs, not as sure about Bronn being in charge of the realms money 

In the end, what was the point of:
-the 3ER
-Jon's true parents
-the Faceless Men
-the Jaime/Brienne hook up
-the Arya/Gendry hook up
-The Night King and the AotD
-the Azor Azai prophesy
-Mellisandre's death
-the dragon with middle child syndrome 
-Varys's letters
-Arya and the white horse

And it was fitting that there be no iron throne in the end, but it was just a chair... the position and power of the &amp;quot;King&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t change, so it basically amounted to an emotional temper tantrum by a dragon.
---Jon shouldn&amp;#39;t have been the one to kill Dany, it should have been something that Varys had done before she killed him that came back to bite her in the ass. But since it wasn&amp;#39;t, what was the point of the letters he was writing and the little girl he was talking to? It feels like three more seasons of the show were left on the cutting room floor.
----What happens to all the places in Essos that were under Danys rule now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya traveling the world
-This just doesn&amp;#39;t fit, she did her traveling to Bravos, became a faceless man, decided &amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s not for me but thanks for the skills I need to finish off my hit list&amp;quot;. She comes back to Westeros to take out all the people that did her family wrong, comes to a crossroads between going to King&amp;#39;s Landing and going home. She chose to go home. So now that the work is done, all her enemies are dead, her family is in control of the Six Kingdoms and the North, she decides to leave? Backpack around Europe for a while? She would have gone home and been a knight of the North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon of the Night&amp;#39;s Watch, again...
-He did his time at the wall, it&amp;#39;s what he wanted at the beginning, he got it, got killed for it, came back to life and left. He was done with that part of his story, no way he should have been sent back. He should have gone beyond the wall by choice, not because he was sent there as punishment.
--So his true parentage, the big secret that Ned kept safe for decades, the big reveal with Bran at the Tower of Joy, meant nothing? Not that he wanted to be king and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been a fitting end to his story IMO. But it literally meant nothing, it may have meant something if he killed Dany because she was threatened by him and he feared for his life but he wouldn&amp;#39;t have done that, he would have just let her kill him. He killed her because he knew she wouldn&amp;#39;t stop trying to take over the world and massacring anyone she felt like including Tyrion, Sansa, Bran, Arya, Sam...
---I choose to believe he rode of into the woods and became a Wildling and never went back to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King Bran the Broken
-Did he say he couldn&amp;#39;t be Lord of Winterfell because he was the 3ER? But he can be King?! He can&amp;#39;t see the future but he pops off that line about &amp;quot;Why do you think I came all this way?&amp;quot; Was he orchestrating all of this to make himself king? Why would he? He was one of the few main characters that never had any interest in the throne. When he became the 3ER he didn&amp;#39;t seem to have much interest in people at all anymore. So why would he want to rule them all? Simple answer he wouldn&amp;#39;t and Bran as King makes no sense.
--Again, so all his abilities, spying on the past, interacting with the past, seeing everything that was and is, didn&amp;#39;t end up meaning much. He did nothing during the battle with the Night King except sit there, he couldn&amp;#39;t/didn&amp;#39;t stop Dany&amp;#39;s rampage, knowing Jon&amp;#39;s parentage meant nothing. What was the point of the 3ER at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand of the King
-Again, King of the North? Yes? No? Maybe?
-While I would have liked to see Tyrion and Bronn turn Highgarden into the land of brothels and retire to spend the rest of their days playing drinking games, he was too smart and too good at the politics to end up anywhere else. He ended up where he belongs, not as sure about Bronn being in charge of the realms money &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, what was the point of:
-the 3ER
-Jon&amp;#39;s true parents
-the Faceless Men
-the Jaime/Brienne hook up
-the Arya/Gendry hook up
-The Night King and the AotD
-the Azor Azai prophesy
-Mellisandre&amp;#39;s death
-the dragon with middle child syndrome 
-Varys&amp;#39;s letters
-Arya and the white horse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m not piecing it all together right, or overlooking the significance of some of this... I don&amp;#39;t know but add me among those that felt this season was completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

The Night King rise up the army of dead and march south. The kingdom of the North formed an alliance with Daenerys' army against the Night King. However, Cersei and the rest of the kingdoms refused to support the coalition war. The army of the northmen, Knight of the Vale, Unsullied and Dothraki are prepare for the battle. They create various of weapons from the dragon glass against the army of dead. However, people of the North disappointed Jon when he give the control to Daenerys as rightful Queen and the ruler of the alliances. Lyanna Mormont enrage at Jon and yell at him in front of Daenerys and all of the commanders. She thought that Jon will hope to the North as a rightful king but he just nothing rather than a puppet of Daenerys. The night fall, the army of the dead almost reach winterfell. The living are prepare for the battle. In the planning room, the commanders having an agreement. "" the unsullied shield wall will be the front line and most of the the army will be in the castle defence"" said Daenerys, ""the Dothraki cavalry charge will be after the enemy reach the first defence line"" said Qhono, Jon Snow stated that we upgraded the castle defence system in this defensive campaign. There will be a giant molten metal in the castle to destroy all the wight that try to climb up the wall, then the pikeman will kill the remaining wight that reach the top. Everyone agreed with those plan and ready for a battle. During the preparation a lot people having fun as it maybe the moment in their living. Tormund tell his story about how he got the name Giantsbane. He told that he can take down a giant when he was 10 and drink milk from the giant which make he a strong man, at the same time Jaime make Brienne become the knight. Ser Jorah walk pass the courtyard, he see his cousin Lyanna Mormont¬† prepare for a fight and refused to hide in the crypt. He try to convinced her to changed her mind but fail. Bran Stark get into a vision again, and now he see that Lyanna Mormont real father is Tormund Giantsbane. Bran call Tormund and tell him that Lyanna Mormont is his daughter and he must protected her. He happy and surprised at the same, then he meet her and tell her the truth. Lyanna cuddle Tormund and cry "" this maybe the last day of my life, but people of the westeros need a better future"" said Lyanna. After and hours later, everyone have prepared for the dreadful battle, even the unsullied warriors are fear these unknown enemies. The trebuchet in the castle started firing up at the enemies, ignite the light like a candle in ocean of corpses. The soldiers are frightened and fear the massive army of dead. The dead march to the gate in the defence line of the unsullied. The Dothraki charge with fire blade from Melisandre and help out the unsullied. The wight try to climb up the wall but being stopped by molten metal, arrows and spears. Daenerys and Jon get in the dragon and fire up the army of dead but soon being stop by snow storm and the Night King himself with of Daenerys Dragon. The defence line was destroyed, the unsullied and Dothraki retreat to the castle. The wall defence fail because of the wight giants which let the dead march into the castle. Soon young Lyanna charged into giant, but the giant grabbed her. Tormund run into the giant and hit it in the leg, he save her from death and fight alongside with her against the remaining wight. The Night King fall down from the dragon during the fight, Daenerys try to burn him down but he's immune by fire. Jon run and try to fight him but soon he raise more dead which make Jon delay to reach him. The Night Knig use Viserion to destroy the wall and defensive line and get to Bran. Theon Greyjoy stand for a last stand against the Night King but he failed which make the Night King reach Bran. Bran travel into the past to stop the Night King in the first very beginning but soon he been stop by the Night King himself. Soon he learn about his true origin that he's the first ruler of Westeros and want to take back what it belongs to him. Bran try to change his mind to stop what's he doing, but soon Jon arrive and fight against the Night King. The wight run toward Jon, but he manage to kill them along the fight with the Night King. Jon lose the fight and being choked by the Night King, but soon Arya rush to the Night King and stabbed him in the back which save Jon life and various people. The battle ended with the alliance victory, the Funeral started and memorial for those who's die in the battlefield such as Theon Greyjoy, Jorah Mormont, Beric Dondarion, Eddison Tollett and countless soldiers. Lyanna Mormont injured by a wight giant, but her wound is far more bigger to be cure. Tormund didn't want his daughter to die, so he beg Melisandre for help. She said she see darkness in her future and she may bring the destruction to the world. Tormund ignored it and beg for her to help his daughter. Melisandre said she can only be cure in Asshai. ""but that too far away, and she may die very soon"" said Tormund. Melisandre said that it would be alright, then she took Lyanna and disappear in the shadow. The party begins and almost everyone having fun except someone, Tormund worried about fate of his daughter and also he discovered that his beloved Brienne got Jaime as her lover, he feel disappointed unlike what he use to be before. In the same time, Daenerys planning for the next siege of King's Landing. She began to gathering the remaining forces to takedown King's Landing. Arya and Sandor travel to King's Landing to finish their final target, along with Jaime who betrayed Breinne and back to his old lover Cersei. But soon Jaime has been caught by Daenerys' forces while crossing the Riverrun border. Varys talk to Tyrion that one day Daenerys maybe changed and Jon must rule the seven kingdoms instead of her, but Tyrion still remain loyal to her, soon Varys get caught by Daenerys and being executed. Tyrion said he wanna talk to Cersei and make her surrender before the war started, she agreed and let him go. Tyrion travel with Missandei and Grey worm to King's Landing for the diplomatic negotiations, however Cersei refused and killed Missandei in front of him and Grey Worm. Grey worm try to calm down his pain for his lover death and go back to Dragonstone with Tyrion. The Siege began at King's Landing, the Alliances army wait in the field waiting for Daenerys command. Daenerys started with attacking the Iron fleet and the Scorpians, but however Euron take his shot and kill Rhaegal. Daenerys enraged for her dragon death. She fire at Euron and destroyed all of Cersei's Forces. The alliances troops marched and attacked the remaining Cersei's forces. Jaime run into the red keep and pleased Cersei to surrender. Soon the bell rang, King's Landing is surrendered. But Daenerys won't stop, she flying over the city and burn down the Red Keep to the ground, Cersei is killed along with Jaime. The wars in over and Daenerys take her position as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. The people of King's Landing welcome the new Queen for freeing them from Tyranny. Gendry rule Storm's end, Jon rule the North, Westeros once in peace again. Bran have his vision again about Lyanna Mormont, this he see that her born with a gift of dark magic which make her far more intelligent than anyone in her age. She born to be a magic user but she never know about her real power. However, Bran vision the incoming danger from the Shadow Lands beyond the fabled land of Asshai. he saw in the vision that there will an army of shadows marching with a huge black bear. ""the end is near"" he said. Daenerys found a split faced raven came from Meereen, half of it face being burned off and show its skull. The message written in Asshai'i language, said that ""your doom has come! Signed your queen"". But Ser Davos see something familiar with this message. ""I think, I've seen¬†this hand writing before, it's look like it from Lyanna Mormont"" said Ser Davos.  ""That's impossible! she would never done that, she just a child"" said Jon. ""oh lucky to heard that my daughter is alive, but why she send an unholy message like this? This is not her I believe!! "" said Tormund. A few days later Daenerys heard the news that the city of Meereen has fallen under the new enemy called ""the Shadow Master"" . Daenerys invite Bran to her private talk and have some relationships with him. She ask him to tell him about this mysterious figure, it origin and how to defeat it. Bran told Daenerys that the shadow master is no one else rather than our own alliance which leads into more confusion in politics. She questioned a lot of lords in her kingdom, and executed a lot people for thinking that one of them is a shadow master. Tyrion started worry about Daenerys gonna start turned into a mad queen like her father. A days later, the Westeros trading fleet sunken by unkown enemy near the Slaver bay. Daenerys along with Jon and Davos has travel and see what happening. The unsullied in the Slaver's bay said in fear that ""they are coming, the shadow!! Beware!!"" which is unusual for the unsullied to having such a fear like that, unless it is something unnatural. Daenerys prepare for the battle of the Slaver's Bay with Jon and Davos. The battle began so soon without any enough preparation. Daenerys, Jon and Davos retreated along with the remaining unsullied. Leaving by the ship and leave the Slaver's Bay Behind. However Davos see that the Shadow Master is no one else rather than Lyanna Mormont herself, she become mad and evil unlike what her use to be. Davos tell Jon and Daenerys what he saw in the battle while sailing back to Westeros. At night, Ser Davos saw Melisandre in his dream, she told him that little Lyanna is a good girl and her best apprentice, but with her eager to learn more secret of dark magic, she turned into different person. "" I warned her not to travel to the Shadow Lands but she refused, she said she strong enough to handle such a thing"" said Melisandre. After they arrived, Daenerys and the lords have a meeting, described about the strategy and tactics against the Mad Queen Lyanna. Tormund enrage and ask Daenerys to stop blaming his daughter, soon Daenerys executed Tormund for creating her new enemy and for being Lyanna's father. Bran see in his vision that Lyanna Mormont try to bring peace and balance through the world but with her own way, she become Queen of Asshai and most part of Essos, and ready to strike Westeros. He travel to her in vision and talk to her about her idea of making peace, Lyanna said to Bran that "" People need better world to live, the world without wars and Tyranny"". ""but the wars is already over, the Night King is defeated, Daenerys ruled the Seven Kingdom now and all slaves are free"" said Bran. "" But people also need more knowledge, not just waste of foolish life. Join me and we can make the world become a better place to live"" said Lyanna. Then Bran being surrounded by the shadows and Lyanna try to consumed him into a shadow, but soon he wake up from his vision. ""Darkness is coming"" said Bran to Arya, he told her to tell everyone else to prepare for the final battle. It began with the fleet of wrecked ships floating from the ocean floor, along with Kraken and Season Monsters sailing toward the Stormlands. Yara Greyjoy drive her fleet into the Shadow fleet she kill the Kraken and the Sea Monsters with the improved Scorpian equipped with wildfire, but unfortunately they are too many. Yara died in the battle by the Shadow fleet cannon. The Shadow fleet landed in the Stormlands and Lyanna Mormont once again set her foot back into Westeros with the army of shadows and dark mages. Gengry try to fight the shadow army but soon he being surrounded by them, Arya come to help him but it is too late, Gengry died. Arya cried for his dead and sneak up behind Lyanna. But this time she being killed by Lyanna's dark magic while attempting to stab her. Daenerys fly with Drogon and try to burn Lyanna but she soon summon her own dragon and fight against Queen Daenerys. Drogon is wounded and about to fall, Daenerys landed on the ground. Lyanna about to kill Daenerys but soon Jon shot the Scorpian bolt into Lyanna and kill her. The shadows disappeared and the dark mages retreated, victory once against for the Westeros. Lyanna speak at the last moments before she died, that her thought is wrong and she has once become Tyrant herself. The Funeral started and memorial for the heroes of the wars who sacrifice their life for people of Westeros. ""Arya, Gengry, Yara and those who fought in the the war, those name will be a legend and will live forever in the history of Westeros. Soon we have learn our mistakes in the past and soon we will improve it for the better future for our children. The time has come for the Golden Age of Westeros, the age of peace and prosperity!!! "" said Daenerys.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Night King rise up the army of dead and march south. The kingdom of the North formed an alliance with Daenerys&amp;#39; army against the Night King. However, Cersei and the rest of the kingdoms refused to support the coalition war. The army of the northmen, Knight of the Vale, Unsullied and Dothraki are prepare for the battle. They create various of weapons from the dragon glass against the army of dead. However, people of the North disappointed Jon when he give the control to Daenerys as rightful Queen and the ruler of the alliances. Lyanna Mormont enrage at Jon and yell at him in front of Daenerys and all of the commanders. She thought that Jon will hope to the North as a rightful king but he just nothing rather than a puppet of Daenerys. The night fall, the army of the dead almost reach winterfell. The living are prepare for the battle. In the planning room, the commanders having an agreement. &amp;quot; the unsullied shield wall will be the front line and most of the the army will be in the castle defence&amp;quot; said Daenerys, &amp;quot;the Dothraki cavalry charge will be after the enemy reach the first defence line&amp;quot; said Qhono, Jon Snow stated that we upgraded the castle defence system in this defensive campaign. There will be a giant molten metal in the castle to destroy all the wight that try to climb up the wall, then the pikeman will kill the remaining wight that reach the top. Everyone agreed with those plan and ready for a battle. During the preparation a lot people having fun as it maybe the moment in their living. Tormund tell his story about how he got the name Giantsbane. He told that he can take down a giant when he was 10 and drink milk from the giant which make he a strong man, at the same time Jaime make Brienne become the knight. Ser Jorah walk pass the courtyard, he see his cousin Lyanna Mormont¬† prepare for a fight and refused to hide in the crypt. He try to convinced her to changed her mind but fail. Bran Stark get into a vision again, and now he see that Lyanna Mormont real father is Tormund Giantsbane. Bran call Tormund and tell him that Lyanna Mormont is his daughter and he must protected her. He happy and surprised at the same, then he meet her and tell her the truth. Lyanna cuddle Tormund and cry &amp;quot; this maybe the last day of my life, but people of the westeros need a better future&amp;quot; said Lyanna. After and hours later, everyone have prepared for the dreadful battle, even the unsullied warriors are fear these unknown enemies. The trebuchet in the castle started firing up at the enemies, ignite the light like a candle in ocean of corpses. The soldiers are frightened and fear the massive army of dead. The dead march to the gate in the defence line of the unsullied. The Dothraki charge with fire blade from Melisandre and help out the unsullied. The wight try to climb up the wall but being stopped by molten metal, arrows and spears. Daenerys and Jon get in the dragon and fire up the army of dead but soon being stop by snow storm and the Night King himself with of Daenerys Dragon. The defence line was destroyed, the unsullied and Dothraki retreat to the castle. The wall defence fail because of the wight giants which let the dead march into the castle. Soon young Lyanna charged into giant, but the giant grabbed her. Tormund run into the giant and hit it in the leg, he save her from death and fight alongside with her against the remaining wight. The Night King fall down from the dragon during the fight, Daenerys try to burn him down but he&amp;#39;s immune by fire. Jon run and try to fight him but soon he raise more dead which make Jon delay to reach him. The Night Knig use Viserion to destroy the wall and defensive line and get to Bran. Theon Greyjoy stand for a last stand against the Night King but he failed which make the Night King reach Bran. Bran travel into the past to stop the Night King in the first very beginning but soon he been stop by the Night King himself. Soon he learn about his true origin that he&amp;#39;s the first ruler of Westeros and want to take back what it belongs to him. Bran try to change his mind to stop what&amp;#39;s he doing, but soon Jon arrive and fight against the Night King. The wight run toward Jon, but he manage to kill them along the fight with the Night King. Jon lose the fight and being choked by the Night King, but soon Arya rush to the Night King and stabbed him in the back which save Jon life and various people. The battle ended with the alliance victory, the Funeral started and memorial for those who&amp;#39;s die in the battlefield such as Theon Greyjoy, Jorah Mormont, Beric Dondarion, Eddison Tollett and countless soldiers. Lyanna Mormont injured by a wight giant, but her wound is far more bigger to be cure. Tormund didn&amp;#39;t want his daughter to die, so he beg Melisandre for help. She said she see darkness in her future and she may bring the destruction to the world. Tormund ignored it and beg for her to help his daughter. Melisandre said she can only be cure in Asshai. &amp;quot;but that too far away, and she may die very soon&amp;quot; said Tormund. Melisandre said that it would be alright, then she took Lyanna and disappear in the shadow. The party begins and almost everyone having fun except someone, Tormund worried about fate of his daughter and also he discovered that his beloved Brienne got Jaime as her lover, he feel disappointed unlike what he use to be before. In the same time, Daenerys planning for the next siege of King&amp;#39;s Landing. She began to gathering the remaining forces to takedown King&amp;#39;s Landing. Arya and Sandor travel to King&amp;#39;s Landing to finish their final target, along with Jaime who betrayed Breinne and back to his old lover Cersei. But soon Jaime has been caught by Daenerys&amp;#39; forces while crossing the Riverrun border. Varys talk to Tyrion that one day Daenerys maybe changed and Jon must rule the seven kingdoms instead of her, but Tyrion still remain loyal to her, soon Varys get caught by Daenerys and being executed. Tyrion said he wanna talk to Cersei and make her surrender before the war started, she agreed and let him go. Tyrion travel with Missandei and Grey worm to King&amp;#39;s Landing for the diplomatic negotiations, however Cersei refused and killed Missandei in front of him and Grey Worm. Grey worm try to calm down his pain for his lover death and go back to Dragonstone with Tyrion. The Siege began at King&amp;#39;s Landing, the Alliances army wait in the field waiting for Daenerys command. Daenerys started with attacking the Iron fleet and the Scorpians, but however Euron take his shot and kill Rhaegal. Daenerys enraged for her dragon death. She fire at Euron and destroyed all of Cersei&amp;#39;s Forces. The alliances troops marched and attacked the remaining Cersei&amp;#39;s forces. Jaime run into the red keep and pleased Cersei to surrender. Soon the bell rang, King&amp;#39;s Landing is surrendered. But Daenerys won&amp;#39;t stop, she flying over the city and burn down the Red Keep to the ground, Cersei is killed along with Jaime. The wars in over and Daenerys take her position as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. The people of King&amp;#39;s Landing welcome the new Queen for freeing them from Tyranny. Gendry rule Storm&amp;#39;s end, Jon rule the North, Westeros once in peace again. Bran have his vision again about Lyanna Mormont, this he see that her born with a gift of dark magic which make her far more intelligent than anyone in her age. She born to be a magic user but she never know about her real power. However, Bran vision the incoming danger from the Shadow Lands beyond the fabled land of Asshai. he saw in the vision that there will an army of shadows marching with a huge black bear. &amp;quot;the end is near&amp;quot; he said. Daenerys found a split faced raven came from Meereen, half of it face being burned off and show its skull. The message written in Asshai&amp;#39;i language, said that &amp;quot;your doom has come! Signed your queen&amp;quot;. But Ser Davos see something familiar with this message. &amp;quot;I think, I&amp;#39;ve seen¬†this hand writing before, it&amp;#39;s look like it from Lyanna Mormont&amp;quot; said Ser Davos.  &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s impossible! she would never done that, she just a child&amp;quot; said Jon. &amp;quot;oh lucky to heard that my daughter is alive, but why she send an unholy message like this? This is not her I believe!! &amp;quot; said Tormund. A few days later Daenerys heard the news that the city of Meereen has fallen under the new enemy called &amp;quot;the Shadow Master&amp;quot; . Daenerys invite Bran to her private talk and have some relationships with him. She ask him to tell him about this mysterious figure, it origin and how to defeat it. Bran told Daenerys that the shadow master is no one else rather than our own alliance which leads into more confusion in politics. She questioned a lot of lords in her kingdom, and executed a lot people for thinking that one of them is a shadow master. Tyrion started worry about Daenerys gonna start turned into a mad queen like her father. A days later, the Westeros trading fleet sunken by unkown enemy near the Slaver bay. Daenerys along with Jon and Davos has travel and see what happening. The unsullied in the Slaver&amp;#39;s bay said in fear that &amp;quot;they are coming, the shadow!! Beware!!&amp;quot; which is unusual for the unsullied to having such a fear like that, unless it is something unnatural. Daenerys prepare for the battle of the Slaver&amp;#39;s Bay with Jon and Davos. The battle began so soon without any enough preparation.

This was made clear in S8E5.

&amp;#x200B;

""M:She won't eat.

V: We'll try again at supper.

M: I think they're watching me.

V: Who?

M: Her soldiers.

V: Of course they are, that's their job. What have I told you, Martha?

M: The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward.""

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Varys ordered Daenerys to be poisoned with Basilisk's Blood. Which would cause ""violent madness... in beasts as well as men"". The reason Vary's would do this? Varys ""hates Magic and those that use it"" ever since he was a boy and was cut by a sorcerer. 

&amp;#x200B;

The spy, Martha, failed to poison Daenerys' food at lunch and shortly afterwards Varys was killed. There is no reason to believe that Martha would not carry out Varys' last order, to 'try again at supper'. From Varys' point of view he does not know why he's been found a traitor. Either his Spy has been caught, Jon turned him in or Tyrion turned him in. His plan hangs in the balance, all resting on what he'll be charged with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before Varys meets his end Tyrion confessed that he was the one who turned him in to Daenerys, the relief is almost palpable on Varys' face, though he masks his true feelings by expressing kinship with Tyrion. But Varys knows that his spy has yet to be caught, that the poison will be planted and Daenerys will go mad. 

&amp;#x200B;

The starks will be forced to dethrone the mother of dragons and her dragon spawn. But will Jon take up the throne? Varys certainly threw caution to the wind trying to convince Jon he would make a great king, repeatedly Varys tried to make a case for Jon being the One True King. Why? Because it's the last variable to Varys' plan, he wants to prime Jon so that when the time comes he will be ready to take up the throne. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen first hand that Varys has patience and the stomach to get what he wants in time. Perhaps this is why he brought Tyrion over to Daenerys, perhaps he needed someone he could... influence.

Let me explain.

So as theories are going around, ultimately I believe he did poison Daenerys with the the long lasting poison. Through one of his lil birds or (maybe even Tyrion directly.) But Tyrion is definitely involved in the plot. Which goes like this.

Varys doesn't trust the Realm in her hand. He's made the decision. Tyrion, is more along the 50/50 line. He is torn between hope and loyalty to the Realm. Hope, that the queen will deliver. Ultimately loyalty to the Realm and protection of most it's people if not. And being Tyrion creates a way to have it both ways

What they came up with was ingenious.

First they'd poison her with the long lasting poison

Then they'd take stab at getting Jon Snow to take the thrown peacefully (knowing this would likely not work and that he would be loyal) but they'd try. If it fails, all their fates are sealed.

You see this in the episode. Just after the lil bird leaves Varys chamber he stares hauntingly and then it's cut to Tyrion with the same stare down on Varys and Jon Snow (as he arrives). They have the stare of knowing and dread. Not suspicion. First time I watched it I thought it was Tyrion getting confirmation that Varys was a traitor. But watching again, he knows exactly what is going on. When he sees Jon Snow walk away from Varys he turns his head in disappointment not because he confirmed Varys being a traitor (he knew this from discussions in episode 4) but because it didn't work and he knows what he has to do.

This is the brutal part.

For the plan to go to the next step, Tyrion has to become Judas, turn in the Martyr Varys, and watch him get killed. Varys in every scene leading up to his death after that clearly knows it's coming. Not a shred of surprise so when Tyrion tells Varys ""I turned you in"" it is is show. More for the Queen (and 'you know nothing Snow) Jon, than an admission. His most telling words are that he hopes he was wrong. He hopes too but isn't ready to leave the Realm without protection.

Unfortunately for Varys and Tyrion, there was no way to know if she'll go mad queen until after the battle. And they know that if she does, she'd win, be all powerful, and unstoppable. So, she is poisoned. Tyrion knows it.

&amp;#x200B;

BECAUSE HE CARRIES THE ANTIDOTE

&amp;#x200B;

Which he'd gladly give to her, with his own life, if she did the right thing in the taking of the Throne.

But she didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, expect a confrontation where Tyrion explains this, and drinks it himself as she dies. The inverse of what happened to Bron in the jail cell.

Short answer: because he has been orchestrating the whole thing since the beginning. Littlefinger and Varys ain‚Äôt got nothing on him, he is the ultimate silent puppetmaster.

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be a difficult theory to write out so bear with me. I want to get it out before the last ep comes out. I still might be wrong but this does make the whole series make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's begin with what the 3 eyed raven (T3ER) really is. He/she/it is a cumulative hivemind of collective consciousness. He/she/it is made up of the consciousnesses/souls of generations of gifted individuals, some of them greenseers, some of them capable of telepathy, but all of them skinchangers.

Why? Because the rules laid out in the ASOIAF world are clear: a skinchanger (warg in the show) can enter the mind of another after death to share / live out a second life in that animal, but if that animal is not also a skinchanger, then they both die without the ability to live on further.

So what if they are a skinchanger? Then they can enter the mind of another skinchanger after death, to be able to enter another, and so on, each time gaining another consciousness into the mix, and thereby splitting the individuality of the subject. I think that T3ER is this concept enacted over many many skinchangers that started way before men even came to westeros, and contains many children of the forest (COTF), and potentially other creatures. Maybe it goes all the way back to a raven. Who knows.

The point is every time T3ER merges with a new being he gains the experience, wisdom and abilities of that individual. The more he has, the more powerful he becomes.

Its hinted that greensight is a imprecise thing, but get enough of them psychically connected and you‚Äôd get a much clearer picture by gaining different perspectives, which is why T3ER sees the future better than Jojen. Either way all of this will eventually add up to a near omniscient power.

Add in the fact that we know T3ER has the ability to send people dreams/visions (he does it to bran to lure him into being his next vessel), and inhabit the body of beasts, this is approaching omnipotent levels of power if you factor in the ability to both manipulate, and see the effects of that manipulation at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

T3ER is basically a naturally made god. Doesn‚Äôt it make sense that he/she/it would ultimately win in the end? But more than that, if you consider that he/she/it was made up mostly of COTF to begin with, that gives T3ER motivation to take over men from the very start.

I believe practically all of the human characters have been pawns in his game, and he created all the nudges they needed along the way. Isn‚Äôt it convenient that we have a story literally full of self-fulfilling prophecies (Dany, Cercei, Melisandre ect), in a world where a being has the ability to both send visions and see the future?

I think T3ER created it all, all the conflict, the magical knowledge that suddenly pops up all over the place to give one side an advantage, all the prophecies, traditions and lore that cause relevant people to act a certain way, all to have the world destroy itself so he can pick up the pieces. He is the ‚Äòlord of light‚Äô, the weirwood god, the ‚Äòmany faced god‚Äô, and he will come out on top in a seemingly innocuous way.

So why now? Why not at any other point in history? Because T3ER was waiting for Bran. The first character we know of who has the ability to skinchange into humans independently, who also happens to be the lord of the most hostile and loyal kingdom suspicious to outsiders. And because T3ER had to have time to weave his plan together.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's start at the start (relatively speaking). The first men invade Westeros and cause havoc on the natural world as men do, and go to war with the angry COTF. The men outnumber the COTF and cannot be coerced by magic because they don't possess the telepathic/soul sharing abilities that the COTF do. At some point all of the male COTF die in battle (or their hivemind seer god T3ER foresees as much), and they realise their species is doomed. So what does T3ER decide to do? He creates a plan in which they win in a roundabout way. A long con. A plan in which they eventually take control of the governance of men, and also pass on their genes as well.

* T3ER interbreeds the COTF with men to give men some skinchanging and telepathic abilities/genes, both to ensure the continuation of T3ER‚Äôs line, and to give these humans the ability to receive visions and dreams (and with that the ability to be manipulated).
* T3ER does this by creating Garth the Greenhand (female COTF male human) to impregnate half the continent and create most of the great houses. After this it's only a matter of time/generations before these genes will filter out to most people. Especially if ‚Äòthe pact‚Äô that the first men agree to includes the tradition of ‚Äòfirst night‚Äô (if Garth sired most of the great houses, then letting the lords sleep with all smallfolk brides on their wedding nights is going to produce a lot more special bastards).
* ‚ÄòThe pact‚Äô between the COTF and men is made to include traditions and rituals that benefit T3ER such as feeding the weirwood trees blood in executions and bodies in burials.
* T3ER foresees the long night, and uses it to his advantage. (I believe that this was caused naturally by a comet crashing into one of the then 2 moons, crushing it into the earth in many pieces, ‚Äòhammering‚Äô into the waters which resulted in the sea level rising and a nuclear winter / blackened sky) T3ER creates legends and prophecies surrounding this event which will be remembered by many.
* T3ER creates the White Walkers, and the Valerians (I have a theory about this also).
* T3ER teaches the Valyrians how to create dragons through inbreeding (the ‚Äò3 heads of the dragon‚Äô are wyverns, wyrms, and Valyrian humans, which is why Valyrians have ‚Äòblood of the dragon‚Äô).
* T3ER also creates the faceless men to cause the doom of Valyria by sending visions/dreams to a slave about how to take down the fragile Valyrian magic holding the volcanoes at bay. But not before sending dreams to Daenys ‚Äòthe dreamer‚Äô to get out of there and take her family to Dragonstone.
* T3ER begins sending Melisandre visions in the fire about the White Walker threat.
* T3ER creates the Dothraki prophecy of the ‚Äòstallion who mounts the world‚Äô so that the Dothraki will follow Daenerys across the narrow sea.
* T3ER sends visions/dreams to Aegon to conquer the 7 kingdoms (may have even caused some of the preceding conflict that enabled Aegon to take over in a relatively peaceful manner as a savior).
* T3ER sends visions/dreams to Daeron/Woods Witch/Rhaegar to bolster the ‚Äòprince who was promised‚Äô thing.
* T3ER sends visions/dreams to Maggy the Frog about Cersei, so that Cersei becomes paranoid and mistrusting of Tyrion, Robert and basically any pretty potential queens, and overprotective of her children (I actually think this is partly why Joffrey was the way he was).
* T3ER sends visions/dreams to Daenerys showing her how to hatch her dragons. (he may have even had a hand in the house of the undying visions, which will make her afraid/paranoid about betrayal)

I think there are a bunch more things that T3ER has influenced (and plenty that we will never know beyond the written story), but I think I covered most relevant ones, and you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

The people in the story are pawns. I think it‚Äôs meant to be ironic that men labeled the children of the forest as such, when they consider men the real children, the real naive ones in this story. The COTF call themselves ‚Äòsingers‚Äô, they weave magical influence through song, and T3ER sings the greatest song of all.

‚ÄòA Song of Ice and Fire‚Äô was never about any one person. It‚Äôs not about Jon, or Dany or even the White Walkers vs the dragons. It‚Äôs about a millennia spanning story that uses those things for an ultimate goal; to take over a threat by the manipulation of human nature.

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs a story about how people don‚Äôt make good rulers. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good a ruler you are because humans are too defined by their limitations. People with good intentions can lack wisdom or foresight. People can seize power by terrible means. Even the best ruler can lack necessary information or be given misinformation. And regardless, it‚Äôs all temporary. If a good ruler can have terrible children/grandchildren then line of succession is inadequate, but even democracy is just another kind of wheel where people vie for power.

The only way to have a stable fair ruler is to have one that knows everything, and isn‚Äôt going to die. Sounds ridiculous but this is exactly what Bran/T3ER is now.

I think T3ER would/will make a good ruler. Tywin once said that wisdom makes a good king. T3ER has literally thousands of years of experience with which to draw from, is impossible to lie to, and will be able to transfer over into another body once Brans starts to fade.

&amp;#x200B;

In true GRRM fashion, I don‚Äôt think T3ER is either good or evil, I think he/she/it is both. It is bittersweet. T3ER has caused a huge amount of death suffering and destruction, but in the end T3ER is saving humanity from itself.

&lt;p&gt;So why now? Why not at any other point in history? Because T3ER was waiting for Bran. The first character we know of who has the ability to skinchange into humans independently, who also happens to be the lord of the most hostile and loyal kingdom suspicious to outsiders. And because T3ER had to have time to weave his plan together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s start at the start (relatively speaking). The first men invade Westeros and cause havoc on the natural world as men do, and go to war with the angry COTF. The men outnumber the COTF and cannot be coerced by magic because they don&amp;#39;t possess the telepathic/soul sharing abilities that the COTF do. At some point all of the male COTF die in battle (or their hivemind seer god T3ER foresees as much), and they realise their species is doomed. So what does T3ER decide to do? He creates a plan in which they win in a roundabout way. A long con. A plan in which they eventually take control of the governance of men, and also pass on their genes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER interbreeds the COTF with men to give men some skinchanging and telepathic abilities/genes, both to ensure the continuation of T3ER‚Äôs line, and to give these humans the ability to receive visions and dreams (and with that the ability to be manipulated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER does this by creating Garth the Greenhand (female COTF male human) to impregnate half the continent and create most of the great houses. After this it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time/generations before these genes will filter out to most people. Especially if ‚Äòthe pact‚Äô that the first men agree to includes the tradition of ‚Äòfirst night‚Äô (if Garth sired most of the great houses, then letting the lords sleep with all smallfolk brides on their wedding nights is going to produce a lot more special bastards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄòThe pact‚Äô between the COTF and men is made to include traditions and rituals that benefit T3ER such as feeding the weirwood trees blood in executions and bodies in burials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER foresees the long night, and uses it to his advantage. (I believe that this was caused naturally by a comet crashing into one of the then 2 moons, crushing it into the earth in many pieces, ‚Äòhammering‚Äô into the waters which resulted in the sea level rising and a nuclear winter / blackened sky) T3ER creates legends and prophecies surrounding this event which will be remembered by many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER creates the White Walkers, and the Valerians (I have a theory about this also).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER teaches the Valyrians how to create dragons through inbreeding (the ‚Äò3 heads of the dragon‚Äô are wyverns, wyrms, and Valyrian humans, which is why Valyrians have ‚Äòblood of the dragon‚Äô).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER also creates the faceless men to cause the doom of Valyria by sending visions/dreams to a slave about how to take down the fragile Valyrian magic holding the volcanoes at bay. But not before sending dreams to Daenys ‚Äòthe dreamer‚Äô to get out of there and take her family to Dragonstone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER begins sending Melisandre visions in the fire about the White Walker threat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER creates the Dothraki prophecy of the ‚Äòstallion who mounts the world‚Äô so that the Dothraki will follow Daenerys across the narrow sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER sends visions/dreams to Aegon to conquer the 7 kingdoms (may have even caused some of the preceding conflict that enabled Aegon to take over in a relatively peaceful manner as a savior).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER sends visions/dreams to Daeron/Woods Witch/Rhaegar to bolster the ‚Äòprince who was promised‚Äô thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER sends visions/dreams to Maggy the Frog about Cersei, so that Cersei becomes paranoid and mistrusting of Tyrion, Robert and basically any pretty potential queens, and overprotective of her children (I actually think this is partly why Joffrey was the way he was).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T3ER sends visions/dreams to Daenerys showing her how to hatch her dragons. (he may have even had a hand in the house of the undying visions, which will make her afraid/paranoid about betrayal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are a bunch more things that T3ER has influenced (and plenty that we will never know beyond the written story), but I think I covered most relevant ones, and you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people in the story are pawns. I think it‚Äôs meant to be ironic that men labeled the children of the forest as such, when they consider men the real children, the real naive ones in this story. The COTF call themselves ‚Äòsingers‚Äô, they weave magical influence through song, and T3ER sings the greatest song of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòA Song of Ice and Fire‚Äô was never about any one person. It‚Äôs not about Jon, or Dany or even the White Walkers vs the dragons. It‚Äôs about a millennia spanning story that uses those things for an ultimate goal; to take over a threat by the manipulation of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a story about how people don‚Äôt make good rulers. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good a ruler you are because humans are too defined by their limitations. People with good intentions can lack wisdom or foresight. People can seize power by terrible means. Even the best ruler can lack necessary information or be given misinformation. And regardless, it‚Äôs all temporary. If a good ruler can have terrible children/grandchildren then line of succession is inadequate, but even democracy is just another kind of wheel where people vie for power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to have a stable fair ruler is to have one that knows everything, and isn‚Äôt going to die. Sounds ridiculous but this is exactly what Bran/T3ER is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think T3ER would/will make a good ruler. Tywin once said that wisdom makes a good king. T3ER has literally thousands of years of experience with which to draw from, is impossible to lie to, and will be able to transfer over into another body once Brans starts to fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In true GRRM fashion, I don‚Äôt think T3ER is either good or evil, I think he/she/it is both. It is bittersweet. T3ER has caused a huge amount of death suffering and destruction, but in the end T3ER is saving humanity from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I just stick to this theory. There are many posts about 3ER is evil, but i haven't seen one where all the clues would be listed, so I decided to summarize it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bits of evidence:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Old Nan says to Bran: 'Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.'

2. Everything we know about the origin of the Night King is the vision, that old 3ER showed to Bran. We don't even know what is a true purpose of the Night King. Bran says(season 8 episode 2), that King‚Äôs motive is an endless night and he wants to get rid of Bran, because Bran is memory of the living. But if 3ER is evil, Bran's words is a lie and the vision may be also a lie. May be the Night King just wanted to kill the 3ER for some reasons. 

3. Bran made Sam Tarly tell John the truth about his origin. Why did he do it? I guess, Bran manipulated Sam, John and everyone. In the season 8 episode 4 before telling the truth Sansa and Arya Bran tells to Jon: 'It's your choice'. But it's a lie) There was no choice. Bran saw the future, he said these words to him because he had to. (may be Jon didn't say the truth without these words). Eventually, Bran tells to Sam -&gt; Sam says to John -&gt; John says to Sansa (there is a conflict between Dany and Jon)-&gt; Sansa tells to Tirion -&gt; Tirion tells to Varys -&gt; Varys tells to others -&gt; Dany executes Varys -&gt; Jon denies Dany (Dany lost dragon and Missandei,because they moved apart from John, because Jon told Sansa the truth) -&gt; eventually, nobody loves Dany in the North, she lost ur 'family' and she left alone -&gt; she was very easy to be manipuldated by Bran.

4. In eseason 8 episode 5, when the bells are ringing, we can see crows are flying towards the King's Landing. I mean, Bran was there and he made Dany to do it, like the 3ER made the Mad King to burn the innocents. If you watch the slowed down version you can hear a voice says: ‚ÄòBurn them‚Äô and this is the voice of the 3ER not the Mad King.

5. The Long Night series - The teaser synopsis reads: ""Only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros' history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend, it's not the story we think we know.""

6. In episode 1 or 2 Bran and Tyrion had a private conversation. Tyrion was a smart guy, so he might find out that Bran isn't good. 

7. Bran did nothing at all yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of the 3ER is to weaken the humanity. He did this all the time, manipulated people -&gt; started wars. Maybe he even made/suggested CotF to create the Night King(in the vision we can see the face on the tree. May be this face is the 3ER's face). So 3ER is the true enemy of the humanity. But i trully don't know how to fit it in one series. Sorry for my bad English.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not my theory. I just stick to this theory. There are many posts about 3ER is evil, but i haven&amp;#39;t seen one where all the clues would be listed, so I decided to summarize it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bits of evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Nan says to Bran: &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t listen to it. Crows are all liars.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything we know about the origin of the Night King is the vision, that old 3ER showed to Bran. We don&amp;#39;t even know what is a true purpose of the Night King. Bran says(season 8 episode 2), that King‚Äôs motive is an endless night and he wants to get rid of Bran, because Bran is memory of the living. But if 3ER is evil, Bran&amp;#39;s words is a lie and the vision may be also a lie. May be the Night King just wanted to kill the 3ER for some reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bran made Sam Tarly tell John the truth about his origin. Why did he do it? I guess, Bran manipulated Sam, John and everyone. In the season 8 episode 4 before telling the truth Sansa and Arya Bran tells to Jon: &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s your choice&amp;#39;. But it&amp;#39;s a lie) There was no choice. Bran saw the future, he said these words to him because he had to. (may be Jon didn&amp;#39;t say the truth without these words). Eventually, Bran tells to Sam -&amp;gt; Sam says to John -&amp;gt; John says to Sansa (there is a conflict between Dany and Jon)-&amp;gt; Sansa tells to Tirion -&amp;gt; Tirion tells to Varys -&amp;gt; Varys tells to others -&amp;gt; Dany executes Varys -&amp;gt; Jon denies Dany (Dany lost dragon and Missandei,because they moved apart from John, because Jon told Sansa the truth) -&amp;gt; eventually, nobody loves Dany in the North, she lost ur &amp;#39;family&amp;#39; and she left alone -&amp;gt; she was very easy to be manipuldated by Bran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In eseason 8 episode 5, when the bells are ringing, we can see crows are flying towards the King&amp;#39;s Landing. I mean, Bran was there and he made Dany to do it, like the 3ER made the Mad King to burn the innocents. If you watch the slowed down version you can hear a voice says: ‚ÄòBurn them‚Äô and this is the voice of the 3ER not the Mad King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Night series - The teaser synopsis reads: &amp;quot;Only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros&amp;#39; history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend, it&amp;#39;s not the story we think we know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In episode 1 or 2 Bran and Tyrion had a private conversation. Tyrion was a smart guy, so he might find out that Bran isn&amp;#39;t good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bran did nothing at all yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the 3ER is to weaken the humanity. He did this all the time, manipulated people -&amp;gt; started wars.

Argument against: They blew the budget on Dragons.

Really? It's amazing what you can do with 3ds Max these days. There's no way they spent all the money on dragons. Plus they saved loads by not spending anything on lighting episode 3.

This is the grand finale of the entire series. There is going to have to be spectacle and dragons have been done now. Sure, there needs to be personal drama, and loose ends being tied up, but there must be some big thrills too.

They had Mammoths way back in season 4, when their budget would have been smaller. It's disinformation, people! Trust me, they have the budget.

&amp;#x200B;

Argument for: Yara.

We only have Harry Strickland and Euron's word for it that there are no elephants, do you trust those guys? Maybe they did bring them to Westeros, but are hanging on to them in case Euron wanted to take King's Landing? And now, Euron is dead, meaning Yara has the elephants.

Yara is coming, there can't be any doubt about that. She'll be bringing elephants. Elephants have been mentioned twice this season and like Checkov's Gun theory says, don't talk about a gun in act one if it isn't used by the last act.

To start, I will start at the end. The last book GRRM is supposed to write in the series is, I think, a Dream of Summer. I think the title really tells us all we need to know about the ending. The end of the story is not things working out nicely, but rather it is about how various things could have worked out  nicely but due to people, politics, and power all being corrupted things don't work out. Yes, there is an ending that closes the saga and life goes on, but it is also a tragedy as the dream of the Summer is just a dream.

So think back to the battle of Winterfell and the battle of King's Landing, there are things that could have gone differently. At Winterfell, Cersei with the Lannister tropps, the Iron Islands, the Golden Company, could have all joined the battle (also Glover and likely others). Perhaps with them all together the dead would have been stopped and the carnage would have been less. Instead we have the betrayal by Cersei and as a result the folks there are not at sufficient strength to stop the assault of the dead. And the tragedy is that so many more die as a result. Yes, Arya saves the day, but at a much greater cost than was necessary.

Now if this was in the books I think this would be brought out better what the impact these choices had. Instead we get the show, where they show this losing battle without the depth of the betrayals brought out, which is part of what is lacking.

Next we get to the battle for King's Landing. This also is the result of Cersei refusing to surrender to someone who has a much more powerful military. So we have the battle. At the battle, there comes a key point where Daenarys dealing with everything makes a choice that ends up defining her in a horrible way. What is lacking is the true emotional depth of that choice. Had Daenarys not made the choice to murder thousands of innocents then in the next episode she could be the ruler. Now she cannot.

Perhaps even further, we can apply this to Jon Snow. He could have decided to not tell about his heritage yet his honor demanded he tell and it ended up causing Daenary, legitimate, reason to be upset. Further, he could have offered to marry Daenarys and put aside perhaps his personal aversion to marrying his aunt (by the Targaryens it was not a big deal) and have been there to temper Daenary but instead he could not get past whatever personal demons to do what would be best for the realm.

When you think about all the things that could have been done, and even perhaps all the Gods machinations to allow for a fairy-tale ending, the tragedy is the man-made prevention of this ending. I think that is ultimately what this story is about. Too bad the show is messing up properly portraying this.

If Dany truly was poisoned in this fashion, signs point to either Varys or Arya.  Tyrion noticed basilisk blood in Grand Maester Pycelle's inventory of poisons, but you would have to suspend your disbelief into believing that Tyrion is suspect, otherwise he wouldn't have turned Varys in for treason.

The tension between the Stark sisters and Dany is pretty evident. Arya DID say that she was going to Kings Landing to kill the queen -- did she really mean Daenerys? Did she see something that Jon didn't see, the same way that she saw through Littlefinger? If anybody could successfully poison Dany, the person most likely to get away with it would be Arya.

However, we have strong evidence that Varys himself was trying to poison Dany -- but so far we didn't see him being successful at it. But what if he succeeded -- perhaps he didn't think that she would actually go so unhinged under the poison's influence as to torch Kings Landing? Maybe one of Varys little birds succeeded where he didn't, but it was the wrong timing? Perhaps Varys just wanted for people to see her as unstable, to diminish her power?

Save this post and let's see if we have a different set of curtains in 2 weeks.* 

*Because so many of you have asked and messaged, yes, if the show decides to just dump seasons' worth of clear clues and deliberate clever scenes, dialogs etc. (as far as up to season 8 episode 5) and doesn't air the real episode(s) within 2 weeks for some unfathomable reason..... I will absolutely write out the explanation. It weaves the entire story together and is so good and nuanced, I am still nervous about how they will unspool so much. I've got to 90-95% of the way. Still missing 5% of the connections myself. But maybe I will figure it out in a few more days or one of you will find the missing piece when I write*

*Lastly, NO ONE is shoving this down your throats. NO ONE is asking you to spend any of your precious attention on it if you don't want to. If you don't like it or it's too delusional for your taste, just move on and do something useful with your time. Don't send hate.*

Original Post 

I'll keep this short and repeat one speech that was fundamental to the show...

*Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish: The realm. Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies, a story we agree to tell each other over and over, until we forget that it's a lie.

Lord Varys: But what do we have left, once we abandon the lie? Chaos? A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.*

There's not one, but two massive twists of the knife this story has in the end. The Jon-Dany story so far is no end. It's just a cog in the wheel - an actual depiction of those who seek and fall (Dany) and those who can but won't (Jon) like so many others before them.

The answer to this is in two people - 

1. The 3Eyed Raven
2. Littlefinger

It will explain absolutely everything. And it started at the very beginning of the show. With a fall, a Raven and a catspaw dagger meant to kill. 

Don't trust the crows. And chaos is a ladder. 

What's a story we agreed to tell each other over and over, till we forgot it was a lie? 

Why did we forget the most dangerous man in Westeros who would see the country burn if he could be king of the ashes?

The most epic reveal(s) in the history of television awaits us. And we are not ready.

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s a story we agreed to tell each other over and over, till we forgot it was a lie? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did we forget the most dangerous man in Westeros who would see the country burn if he could be king of the ashes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most epic reveal(s) in the history of television awaits us. And we are not ready.&lt;/p&gt;

Summary for those who see that there is just too much text to read and just talk shit instead

* Jon finally learns the right meaning for the word hero when he saves the southern woman from one of his northern men.

* Jon finally believes that it can be true that he does have it in him to lead.

* Jon had part of this provided through inception when Varys told him that he was deserving of the crown because he would be the ruler that the people had been deserving to rule.

* Jon saw Dany for what she really was, an usurper, who demanded to rule because she felt that it was her right to do so through lineage. 

* Dany had honestly never learned the value of life, this is why she always demanded so much from those who pledged themselves to her. She thought her life was more important because luck had been bestowed upon her when she didn't burn and was given 3 dragons. 

* Her coming to Westeros was complete madness when she had everything she actually desired in the Kingdom she created in the east because she only knew of the east to be home to her, no memories of the west did she have she was completely raised in the east. She let the lesson of greed that her brother taught her to focus her mind and which ended up making her blind. 

* She had literally demanded from her people that they be a willing sacrifice that she made them, but also that she would not do any honor to them because she willed it , it made it what they had to do. Even if it created more suffering for humanity because war is sacrifice when you die, but the ones who survive are the ones that nature relies on to be doing the act of sacrificing, which is taking lives. 

* Dany could not see that he life was no more precious than that of any of the people that she had led to slaughter in the act of providing her something that she demanded to have, which is a want and she never really needed it to be alive .

* Arya goes to Dany to tell her a message that death has sent her to tell Dany that it was indeed coming for her, but because Arya could no longer hear her actions were seen as problematic and perceived to be threats because Dany was paranoid that Sansa would also be in rivalry for the seat of the throne because didn't Sansa say she didn't trust her to be good.

* Dany decrees that all of the Stark be sentenced to death for the act of treason. Sansa so clever asks for trial by combat instead. Dany thinking she has the upper hand agrees but that her champion would be her and her dragon together. So Sansa called in Jon because she knew the queen just couldn't find it in hey heart to kill. But the queen demands Jon to reject their request because she asked and that she thought Jon would agree because she in fact was demanding it to be true. 

* Because Jon had been so unwilling to not let happen to these he knew as his brother and sisters, he chose to keep doing right by them when if he died too. 

* So Dany instead tries to burn  them but Jon intercepts it and is roasted and no one can believe. So much so that no one noticed that Arya had made her way to the queen as Missandei and stabs her in the heart cuz she did no honor to her when in her memory she destroyed Kings landing. Greyworm dies to the same truth. 

* Jon survives but with hair that is now white, and runs to her side only to be told what Dany knew to be true, that it had always been prophecised to end this way, because she had ignorant in demanding when she was taking what she wanted instead of earning that worth. She dies in his arms.

* Jon becomes the last king known as the sad king after the mad King and uses Drogon's fire to melt the throne as he announced that Westeros would no longer be needing a ruler for there was no longer a heirarchy because everyone was always to be seen as an equal. He mounts Drogon and leaves kings landing to never be seen again. And he accepts what Bran had been telling him when he said that the world would never know a reality with out a night king in rule. Jon accepted that responsibility because it has always been the night king to know when humanity was on the verge of extinction that winter would have to be forever because Jon was the best that humanity had to offer. 

* Arya giving a simple look to Bran and Bran back to her we see her walk over to a shadow and no longer be existing in this reality anymore. 


**This is the long version which provides how I rationalized to get to these conclusions:**


Jon said, ""Fall back"" and ""Retreat!"" to his men who had already started killing without hesitation after, it is who he bowed the knee to, started her act of destruction. So, why was Jon acting so cowardly when it was him who had come so willingly to defend her upsurge? Why was Jon defecting from his Queen's discourse? And why did Jon have to kill one of his men intermediary to all that was happening, because he chose to save a Southern woman, over what is assumed to be of his own blood, that of the first men, that of the North, why did he slay him? What did Jon know?

His last name had never been Stark, as it was not even Snow, but alas it is Targaryen and what did that bestow? That his Father's blood came from the East of Westeros, from a land that is no longer known, from men who had been new men that came with dragons the had the power to cause destruction so devastating that it becomes alienating to him, to what had been established to his core, but his mother's blood had been that of the Old and he was the hybrid of the Old and the New. He was the child philosophers tried to decipher and what the prophets had been describing when they saw all of that destruction. 

He was the hero that laid in hiding. Not because he wasn't a hero, but because he had done nothing that could be considered actually heroic (using only Jon's rhetoric to define what he thinks is a hero, because does Jon consider himself a hero? No). Not until he had to slay one of his own men, to save a human and to save her humanity, did he truly know: that to be a hero, means that you have to be willing to die trying at every indication of danger, to protect those who cannot protect themselves from dying, because why do they matter? They are the people to whom would call him that, which is a hero for his actions.  And a hero is always willing to do that which people are willing to call them because it is the hero that is paying homage to his people to whom he serves, a king is not a king because they are the ruler, a king is only deserving of that title when it is he that serves his people is most sincere.

How had Jon learned this? Why from the Man who had given him his sword, the Man that made him a steward, what had that man planned for him, everything to be a ruler. And why by property of position to fulfill prophecy, did Jon have to die that day, that the men of the black had to go and make sure that Jon knew? That Jon had wronged them by allowing in outsiders, who were just more people, just people who happened to be on the wrong side of a wall, just like the people who decided to kill him, flesh and bone at best. 

Because they were called wildlings, because they were the ones that had decided to be left out in the cold, these ones that were denied their humanity and had lost the status of people. They were wild things that nobody wanted to pay their honor or respects to, because they were the last of the men who had been our first shields which guarded us triumphantly, when they had defeated the Night King and stopped his first attempt at making a forever lasting Winter. And so, Jon had to die properly for him to have served out his service to that of the black. Because Jon had never been groomed to be just a decent leader, Jon had been groomed to be a steward to that of a Kingdom, to groom out the hatred they used to divide and label themselves as anything more to anything less, these were all just people, the people in whom a ruler needed to be in service to, not because to rule means royalty, but instead means servitude, that is why it is a honor to be called a king.

Jon now knew what Varys had told him that Varys himself had believed to be true. The best rulers were made from those who didn't want it because why? They knew how the Game was to be played and they saw the greed for the power and how it always leads to the destruction and complete annihilation of humanity, but because Varys himself had planted his own act of inception to give Jon this very element of complementary thinking, that which he didn't say that Jon deserved to be on the throne because of his blood, but that Jon was deserving of the crown because he would be the ruler that the people were most deserving of.

And why had Dany done what she did, because she was demanding her birthright to be the ruler because she had the power from her dragons, she would become the breaker of chains, a usurper's and she always did it at a cost that was demanding to be paid with her people's blood. 

Because what had Dany been calling to her when she desired to rule, but exactly what was coming to her, when she greedily demanded to her Calvary that they weren't allowed to rest handsomely for the heroics that saved the world? 

The reason she had failed to understand that all that demanding had been calling out to death so loudly and triumphantly who lived out in the void, the reason why she was the one that continued on her path quite ignorantly because she was naive to the fact that all her triumphs had been tragedies for that of humanity. Because she never truly understood that her life wasn't any more valuable than those she sacrificed to get what she had been demanding that was hers, for her to take back rightfully the throne. Which is where the  Kingdom of Westeros was, to the west, across an ocean into lands these people had no care for, for her to be queen of, when she literally had made herself the queen of all the men on that side of the world, why hadn't she already seen that she indeed have a seat on a throne, that she had her Kingdom she had been seeking? 

Why did she deny herself that? Because she had been taught to be greedy by her older brother, she became blind to the humans she sacrificed and blind to humanity, which is why those who demand to lead are called usurpers, because they demanded, they are the ones who fail humanity because they fail to do good. They are ignorant to servitude and keep on demanding what it is that they will, because what made them rulers, why power, and of course they have it. Isn't that what allowed her ancestry to rule this land, the power of the dragon, the power to destruct and annihilate these people who had none? 

Because what happened to their homeland was the reason they had decided to head west, oh right, of course, a complete and random anonymous anomaly that caused their land to simply no longer exist, or was it this the exact reason that death did grant it that honor and why death now honors Dany with her homelands same exact destiny?

Because she had acted tactically and not practically, she had been so caught up with her demanding that she couldn't see that her demands were demanding her people to sacrifice their lives and all that they had to live for, to become sacrifices of greater suffering to humanity, because to achieve what Dany demanded, they had to be willing to be the sacrificed or the ones who did the sacrificing. 
Because what Dany demanded, was against slavery and chains, she claimed to be righteous and selfless in her deeds, but then why did it become tallied, and billed as the debt that she owed substantially to the many-faced God, isn't he the god who collected the dead?

So, why is Arya allowed to live? Is it because she worships the many-faced God? It is because the Hound had shown her humanity and humanity is always seen as good. He told her that continuing on her path only meant death and that he wanted her to keep on continuing to live. Isn't that why she thanked him, time and time again for, the only thing he'd ever want for her was for her to live. So she made sure that he knew honestly how thankful she was because he did her honor by honoring her humanity, death wasn't allowed to take her life because it didn't when it should've.

So, Arya goes up to Dany, not with the intention to kill, but as the hero that saved the world from forever being winter, to tell Dany that death was coming for her to collect its debt that she hadn't known she accrued, but because she is unable to hear, she is unable to understand what the queen has demanded of her, she is then charged with treason and attempted murder, and because Dany rules by her will, she sentences Arya to die, because she doesn't trust that Sansa hadn't planned this act of betrayal, because wasn't it also Sansa that simply said to Dany that she simply had no trust to give her because it was she demanded and had not yet earned.

Dany who is filthy with her greed and her power, uses that same paranoia that made her father as mad as a hatter, she sentences Sansa and Bran to those sentences as well, but Sansa is smart and Sansa is quick on her feet, asks her for a trial by combat, and because Dany is also unpredictable at best agrees but with one condition, she would be her own hero who will be riding Drogon, her dragon. But because she was so quick in her boasting she had assumed that Sansa would call Brienne to be her hero to fight Greyworm who she'd assume that Sansa would be prepared to defeat, she left Jon unprotected and Sansa would use that against her. 

So because she is the queen and she is always demanding, she demands that Jon denies them what they ask him to offer. Jon says I'm sorry but it is my duty as the one chosen to do the best I can do to honor them by having the chance to be innocent of what has been sentenced upon them. Dany gets heated at this complete denial of her demands, she then revokes that chance of trial by combat and demands that Drogon burns them with fire, but the fire never reaches because Jon sacrifices himself by intercepting that sentence. And because it is that Jon did something that no one expected, for the first time did Dany realize what losing a life meant, that it gave Arya the complete opportunity to be unnoticed and to the queen, she went but not as herself but as that of Missandei. So when the queen, finally able to realize her folly, saw who it was that had stabbed her in the heart, she knew that it was because what she had decided to befall upon to Kings landing was dedicated to Missandei, which had completely been dishonoring to the life that Missandei had lived, that death chose this face to teach Dany that in death there is no honor, just the chance to become nothing and forgotten. 

Greyworm runs to Missandei and says how can this be and what have you done? You've killed the queen, but how? I saw you be taken from me! And that is how he meets his end, because what did he partake in too? Dany's dirty little deed. So she says that's right I was taken from you, but you did dishonor to me when you thought killing in my name would ever be honorary, so death comes to collect in the most honoring way it can imagine. And to that Arya removes the mask and we see that Greyworm has fallen. 

But what happened to Jon who was supposed to be burning alive, why he did burn but not the way any could have expected. Jon, as Aegon, was Targaryen right? What color was hair before he was fried? Black and now it was as white as snow complimentary to how he'd been a Snow his whole life. Jon rushes to Dany and cries look what you've done, but Dany says Aegon don't cry for me my dear, this was always my fate as it has been made clear. I used those I should have been loving and honoring to accomplish my will, I brought upon me the sentence death has sentenced me when I had  demanded to be given what I thought was owed to me by my lineage, that of what I had not earned honorably, for I never honored those who I asked to honor me by allowing me to sacrifice them. Can't you see Aegon, why your mother, why she did what she did when she asked her brother to accept you as his bastard and to keep your true lineage hidden, even from you? She didn't want the game to consume you like how it consumed everyone else as it always did. She wanted to extend to you an offering of having the chance to get to choose humanity over your kin.

Dany dies in his arms and after that Jon never again sheds a tear but as the next Targaryen to follow the mad King, Jon becomes the sad king who never marries, the one that ends the insanity, because he says that this land will never again be ruled after me, and uses Drogon to melt the chair instantly, climbs on his back and takes off, never to be seen or heard of again. that is how the game ends. But the last scene is Arya who looks to Bran one last time in a gesture only they both know and as she passes through a shadow, she is simply no more.

Jon becomes the next night king because he's the only one to act rationally in knowing when it is time to offer to humanity what it no longer serves and brings on the never-ending winter because Jon was the best of humanity, he would know when they no longer deserved to be human, and become nothing like it is always meant for the lives we lead when we aren't pure.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my theory to the ending. Don&amp;#39;t murder me, please. This is just what I think may happen. This is only to create discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Arya goes up to Dany, not with the intention to kill, but as the hero that saved the world from forever being winter, to tell Dany that death was coming for her to collect its debt that she hadn&amp;#39;t known she accrued, but because she is unable to hear, she is unable to understand what the queen has demanded of her, she is then charged with treason and attempted murder, and because Dany rules by her will, she sentences Arya to die, because she doesn&amp;#39;t trust that Sansa hadn&amp;#39;t planned this act of betrayal, because wasn&amp;#39;t it also Sansa that simply said to Dany that she simply had no trust to give her because it was she demanded and had not yet earned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany who is filthy with her greed and her power, uses that same paranoia that made her father as mad as a hatter, she sentences Sansa and Bran to those sentences as well, but Sansa is smart and Sansa is quick on her feet, asks her for a trial by combat, and because Dany is also unpredictable at best agrees but with one condition, she would be her own hero who will be riding Drogon, her dragon. But because she was so quick in her boasting she had assumed that Sansa would call Brienne to be her hero to fight Greyworm who she&amp;#39;d assume that Sansa would be prepared to defeat, she left Jon unprotected and Sansa would use that against her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So because she is the queen and she is always demanding, she demands that Jon denies them what they ask him to offer. Jon says I&amp;#39;m sorry but it is my duty as the one chosen to do the best I can do to honor them by having the chance to be innocent of what has been sentenced upon them. Dany gets heated at this complete denial of her demands, she then revokes that chance of trial by combat and demands that Drogon burns them with fire, but the fire never reaches because Jon sacrifices himself by intercepting that sentence. And because it is that Jon did something that no one expected, for the first time did Dany realize what losing a life meant, that it gave Arya the complete opportunity to be unnoticed and to the queen, she went but not as herself but as that of Missandei. So when the queen, finally able to realize her folly, saw who it was that had stabbed her in the heart, she knew that it was because what she had decided to befall upon to Kings landing was dedicated to Missandei, which had completely been dishonoring to the life that Missandei had lived, that death chose this face to teach Dany that in death there is no honor, just the chance to become nothing and forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greyworm runs to Missandei and says how can this be and what have you done? You&amp;#39;ve killed the queen, but how? I saw you be taken from me! And that is how he meets his end, because what did he partake in too? Dany&amp;#39;s dirty little deed. So she says that&amp;#39;s right I was taken from you, but you did dishonor to me when you thought killing in my name would ever be honorary, so death comes to collect in the most honoring way it can imagine. And to that Arya removes the mask and we see that Greyworm has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happened to Jon who was supposed to be burning alive, why he did burn but not the way any could have expected. Jon, as Aegon, was Targaryen right? What color was hair before he was fried? Black and now it was as white as snow complimentary to how he&amp;#39;d been a Snow his whole life. Jon rushes to Dany and cries look what you&amp;#39;ve done, but Dany says Aegon don&amp;#39;t cry for me my dear, this was always my fate as it has been made clear. I used those I should have been loving and honoring to accomplish my will, I brought upon me the sentence death has sentenced me when I had  demanded to be given what I thought was owed to me by my lineage, that of what I had not earned honorably, for I never honored those who I asked to honor me by allowing me to sacrifice them. Can&amp;#39;t you see Aegon, why your mother, why she did what she did when she asked her brother to accept you as his bastard and to keep your true lineage hidden, even from you? She didn&amp;#39;t want the game to consume you like how it consumed everyone else as it always did. She wanted to extend to you an offering of having the chance to get to choose humanity over your kin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany dies in his arms and after that Jon never again sheds a tear but as the next Targaryen to follow the mad King, Jon becomes the sad king who never marries, the one that ends the insanity, because he says that this land will never again be ruled after me, and uses Drogon to melt the chair instantly, climbs on his back and takes off, never to be seen or heard of again. that is how the game ends. But the last scene is Arya who looks to Bran one last time in a gesture only they both know and as she passes through a shadow, she is simply no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon becomes the next night king because he&amp;#39;s the only one to act rationally in knowing when it is time to offer to humanity what it no longer serves and brings on the never-ending winter because Jon was the best of humanity, he would know when they no longer deserved to be human, and become nothing like it is always meant for the lives we lead when we aren&amp;#39;t pure.&lt;/p&gt;

To be honest the show creators can't possibly fit all this into the final episode, but they could end with it headed in this direction... 

It is highly doubtful that Daenerys will allow Jon, Tyrion or Arya anywhere near her. She considers all of them treasonous (technically she hasn't really said such about Tyrion but how could she not find out about his treasonous release of Jaime). But I think most of us can agree that Daenerys will be killed in this next episode. More than likely she will be killed by Arya or Jon. I've always thought Jon is Azor Ahai, but then Arya killed the night king, was ""born again amidst smoke and salt"" during the destruction of King's Landing, and delivered out of the destruction on the back of a pale mare. I think both Jon and Arya will play pivotal roles in the death of Daenerys, but I'm not sure which one will actually do it. I'm also not sure which one is Azor Ahai or if that prophecy will even be fulfilled. If the prophecy is fulfilled it won't happen exactly as it was supposed to happen. Maybe there isn't just one hero. Maybe peace is only possible when we all work together for the greater good. 

It seems more than likely Arya will kill Daenerys, and the only way I can imagine that happening is for Arya to kill Grey Worm and use his face to get close to Daenerys. This would kill two birds with one stone by giving us one more faceless man kill and fulfilling Melisandre's ""green eyes"" prophecy. I would imagine that Drogon will not react well to Daenerys being killed, so maybe he will be killed or subdued by Jon, possibly with help from Bran and Tyrion. 

If Jon were to kill Daenerys it could fulfill the Azor Ahai prophecy, but I don't know what it would mean for Arya and it would completely up-end everything. I really don't know what would happen if this were to play out, but it wouldn't be a bad thing. 

Even if Arya does kill Daenerys and survives I seriously doubt she'll marry Gendry and become a lady or anything like that. More than likely she'll just go off on her own to live a life of adventure and exploration. Maybe she'll become a benevolent land pirate or Robin Hood of sorts, fighting for the small folk. Sisterhood Without Banners? 

Now, assuming Daenerys is killed, the only way this story can end relatively well is if those in who remain standing divide the seven ""kingdoms"" ruled by one king (it's actually just one kingdom) into different true kingdoms who share the power equally. Basically they have to create a United Nations of Westeros. They could divide the continent in half (north and south) or divide it into several kingdoms: The True North beyond the Wall, The Stark North (including the Riverlands, The Vale and The Neck), the Iron Islands, &amp; Dorne. As far as the ""middle section"" goes, they could divide it in various ways or combine everything from Lannisport &amp; Oldtown to Dragonstone, Tarth, &amp; Cape Wrath. There are a hundred different possibilities of how Westeros could be divided. 

Jon, Tyrion, Sansa and possibly Bran will oversee the restructuring of the seven ""kingdoms"" into smaller, independent kingdoms. There would need to be a council made up of the kings of the separate kingdoms. Perhaps Bran could oversee the establishment of this council and the restructuring of the kingdoms. He wouldn't have an official, permanent position as 'head of the council' because anyone who occupied that position after him would essentially control all of Westeros - which would inevitably lead to the same terrible power struggles we've dealing with the entire time.

Sansa would become Queen of the North (which I think should include the Riverlands, the Vale, and the Neck, and possibly the North beyond the wall). (""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"")

Jon would return to the ""true"" North beyond the Wall. Perhaps he would become the king of the Free Folk and establish a new official kingdom of Westeros there. (""You've got the North in you - the real North."" -Tormund Giantsbane to Jon Snow. Plus Ghost is waiting for him.) 

Tyrion... There are several possibilities for him, but I'm not sure what he would ultimately end up doing. He would definitely be instrumental in the establishment of the council. He could also return to Winterfell to rule the north with Sansa, but I just don't see that happening. Alternatively - and to me this is the most likely scenario - he could return to Casterly Rock and become king of one of the new kingdoms (""Mid-Westeros?""). Casterly Rock is his ancestral home and he designed some of the sewers and cisterns underneath it. Also, Tywin very harshly and coldly denied Casterly Rock to Tyrion when Tyrion asked him for it: ""But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go!"" So it would be fortuitous and a sweet victory for Tyrion to finally become the Lord or King of Casterly Rock. 

Davos will probably be given a new lordship that expands on what Stannis had promised him (maybe all of Cape Wrath and then some). Perhaps he'll be named 'Lord of the Narrow Sea.' (His name is Seaworth, after all)

Bronn... I liked Bronn as a sellsword but I just don't see how it could possibly end well for him to be Lord of anything, much less Highgarden. Maybe Tyrion will kill him or buy him off somehow. Who knows. 

Gendry will remain Lord of Storms End. 

Brienne will probably become Lady Commander of the Queen's Guard for Sansa, the Queen of the North. I suppose she could return to Tarth, but I don't see that happening. 

And there you have it. That's what I can envision happening and it would tie up most of the loose ends which remain (at least the ones that can still be tied up). It would also be the the most neat and tidy ending that can be imagined at this point, but as we all know, things never end neatly or as we'd expect in Westeros.

EDIT (addition):
As I should have known before attempting to theorize, other things have occurred to me. It's entirely possible Bran will become the new king of Westeros. And I think he'd make the best king imaginable because ""[the 3ER is the world's] memory."" And he's unemotional and not motivated by power or greed. He's virtually all knowing - he can see the past, present, and future. He only seems to want the preservation of the world and its memory, and the only way to truly preserve those things is through peace and cooperation against the forces of destruction and 'evil' - regardless of the forms those destructive forces take (Night King, Cersei, Daenerys &amp; her dragons, Littlefinger, Tywin Lannister, etc.). He understands that any time a powerful individual focuses (or obsesses) only on personal gain to the exclusion of everything else, it is a threat to all of humanity because everyone loses sight of the bigger picture (and bigger threats).

Almost all the main characters are killed off, Drogon eats Jon Snow in one go.

All major characters get killed except Brienne of Tarth, the camera then pans to her bulging abdomen carrying the son of Jaime Lannister. It then flash forwards 10 years and the young son of Brienne and Jamie sits on the Iron Throne.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My theory is that there is a final battle between Jon and Daenerys, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the main characters are killed off, Drogon eats Jon Snow in one go. Tyron gets cornered by and is about to get blasted by Daenerys and Drogon when Ser Bronn of the Blackwater pops up from a battlement and head-shots Daenerys killing her with the crossbow Cersei gave him. Drogon then looses focus and flies away in confusion never to be seen again. Then Ser Bronn gets his castle from Tyrion who marries Sansa again and they both sit on the Iron Throne together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All major characters get killed except Brienne of Tarth, the camera then pans to her bulging abdomen carrying the son of Jaime Lannister. It then flash forwards 10 years and the young son of Brienne and Jamie sits on the Iron Throne.&lt;/p&gt;

What if they don‚Äôt stop at the Mad Queen/Mad King idea alone? As I started thinking back to the big events of S1, and even pre-S1, all of the pieces of the finale puzzle started falling in place. It almost felt automatic and inevitable. I recognize that I have only a sliver of a chance of being correct about any of this, but if Benioff and Weiss adopt any of the plot points below, then I\'ll bend the knee. It would be the greatest upset of all time after much of the audience has been dragging them for 5 weeks straight for poor writing.\n\nTLDR: The finale of the show will mirror memorable plot points, scenes, family ties, quotes, and even nicknames from Season 1. It will bring virtually all surviving show characters together for the finale but will also call back to those that have died. We will end, in a sense, back where we began.\n\nSorry for the length, but as more questions kept popping up (how will they kill a dragon, who will end up on the throne, how would Dany die, etc.) and as more puzzle pieces fell into place, the longer this theory became.\n\n(1) Jon is locked up before or shortly after the episode begins because Greyworm tells Dany about Jon‚Äôs retreat order. This is a callback to Ned Stark being locked up in S1. Davos &amp; the other northerners who retreated are also rounded up by Dany, Drogon, &amp; her soldiers.\n\n(2) Having received Varys‚Äô letters and learned about Dany‚Äôs slaughter of innocents, all able-bodied people (not just soldiers) in Westeros + every main character still alive show up to King\'s Landing to confront Dany. They surround what remains of a decimated Red Keep. The director showed us repeatedly last episode that Drogon had decimated virtually the entire city and not just a straight line to the Red Keep. This was done to allow for all arriving people of the 7 Kingdoms to surround the Red Keep and get in close to the action during the finale.\n\n(3) Dany, on the Iron Throne, having seen the people of Westeros arrive to usurp her, starts ranting that she will ‚Äúburn them all,‚Äù a callback to the Mad King pre-S1 but she\'ll use dragon fire instead of wildfire. She decides to start with Jon, a traitor &amp; threat to her claim to the throne. Dany, flanked and safely protected by Drogon, Unsullied, &amp; Dothraki, has Jon marched out in front of everyone for public execution.\n\n(4) Arya, having returned to KL with Sansa &amp; the people of the North, is now once again forced to watch a Stark family member be needlessly executed at KL, a callback to S1 when she (almost) watched her father\'s beheading. Indeed, Starks do not fare well in the South and Kings in the North are not long for this world. As an added insult and provocation on Dany\'s part, we see the Unsullied executioner holding Longclaw in his hand.\n\n(5) To everyone‚Äôs surprise, Dany suddenly gives the ‚ÄúDracarys‚Äù order. Drogon hesitates for a second since he knows Jon and ""senses the Targaryen"" in him or whatever, but he follows his mother\'s order and roasts Jon alive with Sansa, Arya, and other main characters looking on in horror. Arya instinctively starts to leave Sansa‚Äôs side to head toward the Red Keep to try to assassinate Dany.\n\n(6) But she looks up toward the Red Keep and abruptly stops moving. She sees Tyrion Lannister, still positioned alongside Dany as Hand of the Queen, suddenly stab Dany through the chest from behind. Tyrion had continued to feign loyalty to Dany in order to survive after the Ep. 5 slaughter of KL, but also to keep his position close to Dany so he could enact a plan to remove her from power, killing her if necessary. Tyrion, the last person in the realm who we\'d expect to use a blade, thus becomes the ‚ÄúQueenslayer‚Äù - a perfect callback to pre-S1, a perfect reference to his brother the Kingslayer, another conflicted Lannister Hand slaying a mad Targaryen monarch.\n\n(7) Drogon feels/hears his mother‚Äôs pain &amp; immediately turns to Tyrion in a fit of rage. Greyworm, etc. turn toward Tyrion as well. As Drogon is about to roast Tyrion, a Scorpion arrow suddenly flies from behind Tyrion and blasts straight through Drogon‚Äôs skull - a callback to Cersei‚Äôs Scorpion test on the dragon skull in the KL basement.\n\n(8) The camera cuts to Bronn standing behind the last, and, ironically, the first, Scorpion in KL. The writers have hit us with double foreshadowing here - Bronn was the first person to successfully hit Drogon with a Scorpion arrow in S7, and earlier in S8 he was given a crossbow (a mini Scorpion if you will) and threatened to kill Tyrion and Jamie with it. At this point, it simply has to be Bronn who kills Drogon.\n\n(9) Also, I\'m not sure if this was intentional or not, but the writers said the Opening Credits would be different in every episode of S8 and that they would contain clues.  Well, they showed the Scorpion Arrow-&gt;Dragon Skull perspective in the KL portion of the credits this season every single time. They also showed the basement dragon skull during Ep. 5 but didn‚Äôt show the old Scorpion when C&amp;J ran by. The writers wanted us to believe there were no more Scorpions in KL based on Qyburn‚Äôs battle updates. I would suggest that the writers didn\'t want us to think about the one in the basement going into the Finale.\n\n(10) The show has continuously tried to tell us these past 2 seasons that Tyrion had lost his fastball, that his cleverness has failed him, that his loyalty to Dany had blinded him - causing him to trust Cersei‚Äôs word &amp; to turn on Varys when he knew Varys was probably right about Dany. But now it\'s revealed that Tyrion secretly put a plan in place prior to the KL battle of Ep. 5 to assassinate Dany &amp; her dragon in one fell swoop. \n\n(11) It‚Äôs revealed that prior to the Ep. 5 attack, Tyrion didn\'t merely release Jamie, he also met or communicated with Bronn. Tyrion needed a backup plan now that he had seen a crazed Dany at Dragonstone and he feared that she might slaughter everyone in KL.  Bronn was still accepted in KL as a friend to the throne. Tyrion convinced Bronn of the danger Dany posed, reminded him of his future at Casterly Rock, and had Bronn remove the original Scorpion from the KL basement, so it could be stowed away as ‚Äúdragon insurance"" in the event that the Mad Queen took the city by violence and fear instead of accepting her enemy\'s surrender.\n\n(12) Tyrion had Bronn reassemble the Scorpion in a discreet enough location near the landing outside of the Great Hall.  Tyrion banked on the assumption that Dany would not completely destroy the throne that she had long sought to occupy and that the hidden Scorpion would not be destroyed during Dany\'s assault. Obviously, Bronn couldn‚Äôt move and reassemble the Scorpion by himself prior to the Ep. 5 battle, so he had Lannister soldiers move it upstairs into a position to help ‚Äúprotect the throne‚Äù as a ""last line of defense"" against a dragon attack of the Red Keep.\n\n(13) Turning back to the instant of Dany\'s assassination by Tyrion\'s hand, Greyworm, the Unsullied, &amp; Dothraki are shocked, betrayed, and enraged, and they now realize they face their impending doom given the loss of Drogon and the sheer number of bloodthirsty people and fighters surrounding the Red Keep. The people of the 7 kingdoms charge the circle of Unsullied &amp; Dothraki.\n\n(14) Greyworm, with the same crazed look in his eye from last episode, charges at Tyrion with his spear. There is a shot of Tyrion silently accepting his fate, a callback to his line last episode about the sacrifice of one dwarf being worth it to save the lives of thousands of innocents.\n\n(15) As Greyworm is about to impale Tyrion, Greyworm is suddenly stopped in his tracks and we hear the sound effect of sword entering flesh. We see Greyworm\'s expression turn from vengeful anger to shock. The camera starts with a close-up on his face, he looks down toward his torso, the camera follows his gaze downward and we see a large, silver blade impaling his torso from the left to the right. The camera pans to the left, to the bleeding entry wound, to the blade, to the crossguard, to the grip, and finally to the pommel, where the camera rests on the White Wolf ornament with which we‚Äôre all familiar. Longclaw.\n\n(16) Without stopping the shot, the camera then pans upward from the sword hilt to an unclothed, soot-blackened torso, to the dirty but familiar face of Jon Snow - the King in the North, the Bastard of Winterfell, the White Wolf, Aegon Targaryen, THE UNBURNT - who had survived Drogon‚Äôs execution by fire. This is the ultimate callback to Dany‚Äôs S1/S6 scenes where it was demonstrated that Targaryens are impervious to fire. The nearby Unsullied &amp; Dothraki who witnessed Jon\'s resurrection from the flames stand in awe and drop their weapons, and they all bow and/or bend the knee to Jon.\n\n(17) A minor point, but the Unsullied executioner who had been holding Longclaw either needs to be shown in a medium shot bowing to Jon (and we can infer that he must have dropped the sword and bowed when he was the first person to see Jon rise from the flames) or dead on the ground (and we can infer that Jon must have swiped Longclaw from him and quickly killed him). The fighting on the perimeter of Dany‚Äôs forces slowly stops as well as they look up to the Red Keep. As Jon stares down remorsefully at Dany‚Äôs body, every person at KL bends the knee to Jon Snow. This would be a panoramic shot and close-ups on the main characters, like Arya, Sansa, Brienne, bending the knee. As an unfortunately necessary side note, they don\'t have to go ""full frontal"" but Jon has to be in the nude, reborn, elemental when he survives the flames - he has to look the same way Dany looked. Putting tattered Hulk pants on him would cheapen the moment.\n\n(18) Jon kneels down and cradles Dany in the same way he had cradled Ygritte when she died. He knows what Dany had turned into but he nevertheless loved her, admired her, believed in her. He feels responsible for the loss of what could have been. He feels responsible for causing Dany\'s descent into madness and her eventual death. He feels responsible for not foreseeing the Iron Fleet\'s attack at Dragonstone, the death of Rhaegal, the capture and execution of Missandei, and the resulting rage of Dany and Greyworm. He feels regret for exposing his Targaryen secret to his sisters, which he realizes cascaded down to Tyrion and Varys and set off this chain of events. After a panoramic shot of the whole kingdom kneeling before Jon Snow on the elevated landing of the Red Keep, there is a cut to black. A little bit of time passes.\n\n(19) Due to Tyrion‚Äôs actions, Arya did not fulfill Melisandre‚Äôs ‚Äúgreen eyes‚Äù prophecy by killing Cersei. This is symbolic of Arya‚Äôs shift away from a life of revenge/fate and toward a life of compassion (as she showed in Ep 5), leadership, and free will. That was such a great moment between Arya and the Hound in the last episode, so it must now be shown to have a lasting impact in the finale.\n\n(20) Jon, as he has always said, does not want the throne &amp; renounces his rightful claim. He\'s done with the South and life below the Wall. He\'s been betrayed, murdered, and executed, he\'s lost the two loves of his life, he\'s lost his parents and siblings, and he\'s fought battles against the living and the dead. His watch has ended. He\'ll go beyond the wall with Tormund and Ghost; maybe he\'ll live out his days like Tom Cruise at the end of the Last Samurai. Think of what Tormund said at the end of Episode 4 - Jon says Ghost will be happier up north and Tormund replies, ‚ÄúSo would you.‚Äù And Tormund\'s last line to Jon: ‚ÄúYou got the north in you, the real north.‚Äù\n\n(21) So who ends up on the Iron Throne? We end up with Lord Gendry Baratheon (ironically now a Lord because of Dany\'s actions a couple episodes ago) having the top claim to the throne. Some main characters like Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Davos, and Tyrion are seen convincing him to accept the throne, despite his reluctance. Gendry agrees but on one condition - that Arya be his queen, and he turns to look Arya in the eye after he says the line. Arya, now a changed person from the last time Gendry asked, happily agrees.\n\n(22) We have now come full circle to S1. We end with another Baratheon man loving a Stark woman - just like how Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark, which was the root of Robert‚Äôs Rebellion and everything we watched over the course of eight seasons. Except now this Stark woman (fortunately) loves this Baratheon man. In fact, when you step back and think about it, Arya/Gendry may be the longest, slow-burning love relationship in the entire show. What a perfectly fitting way to resolve that storyline.\n\n(23) Based on everything we\'ve seen from Arya and Gendry during the show, we are left with the belief that their JOINT rule will be just, long, and respected by all citizens of the 7 Kingdoms. While we\'ve been focused on one throne and one ruler this entire series, perhaps it was called the Game of THRONES for a reason. Two rulers, two thrones, two decent, experienced, hardened, compassionate members of two of the most likable houses in the 7 Kingdoms may be what\'s needed to rebuild the realm, restore trust, and achieve long-term peace and prosperity. In a surprise twist, we end on a bittersweet yet hopeful note instead of a dark one. Spring is coming.\n\nFN1: Based on this show\'s history, it is far more likely that my predictions are completely wrong and GOT is going to end on a dark note, or at least a hint of future darkness. I‚Äôve been trying to think of a side character we haven‚Äôt seen in awhile who might pop up in one additional final scene and give the audience a wink toward inevitable violence &amp; rebellion after season‚Äôs end. It just seems like all such candidates are already dead, so I don\'t see how it could happen.\n\nFN2: When I say everyone in Westeros will show up to surround the Red Keep in the Finale, I mean everyone. You can bring in Essos people, too. Give us Yara Greyjoy. Give us an older Robin Arryn. Give us Jaqen H\'ghar. Even better, give us Daario Naharas and place him with the people, even though it is visibly eating at his heart to be on that side. Have Dany see him in the crowd, and, instead of recognizing the folly of her ways, it only causes her to grow madder.\n\nWhat does everyone think? That took far too long to type out but it was enjoyable. Now I\'ll cross my fingers that I\'m wrong in every possible way so that I can be fully surprised and moved by the finale.\n\n[EDIT: Screw it - I will stubbornly and pigheadedly say that my ending was better. One big thing I was struggling with was how Tyrion would kill Dany because it would have been out-of-character for him to use a knife or sword. Then he pulled out the sharp ""Hand of the Queen"" brooch during the finale!

The people of the 7 kingdoms charge the circle of Unsullied &amp;amp; Dothraki.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(14) Greyworm, with the same crazed look in his eye from last episode, charges at Tyrion with his spear. There is a shot of Tyrion silently accepting his fate, a callback to his line last episode about the sacrifice of one dwarf being worth it to save the lives of thousands of innocents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(15) As Greyworm is about to impale Tyrion, Greyworm is suddenly stopped in his tracks and we hear the sound effect of sword entering flesh. We see Greyworm&amp;#39;s expression turn from vengeful anger to shock. The camera starts with a close-up on his face, he looks down toward his torso, the camera follows his gaze downward and we see a large, silver blade impaling his torso from the left to the right. The camera pans to the left, to the bleeding entry wound, to the blade, to the crossguard, to the grip, and finally to the pommel, where the camera rests on the White Wolf ornament with which we‚Äôre all familiar. Longclaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(16) Without stopping the shot, the camera then pans upward from the sword hilt to an unclothed, soot-blackened torso, to the dirty but familiar face of Jon Snow - the King in the North, the Bastard of Winterfell, the White Wolf, Aegon Targaryen, THE UNBURNT - who had survived Drogon‚Äôs execution by fire. This is the ultimate callback to Dany‚Äôs S1/S6 scenes where it was demonstrated that Targaryens are impervious to fire. The nearby Unsullied &amp;amp; Dothraki who witnessed Jon&amp;#39;s resurrection from the flames stand in awe and drop their weapons, and they all bow and/or bend the knee to Jon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(17) A minor point, but the Unsullied executioner who had been holding Longclaw either needs to be shown in a medium shot bowing to Jon (and we can infer that he must have dropped the sword and bowed when he was the first person to see Jon rise from the flames) or dead on the ground (and we can infer that Jon must have swiped Longclaw from him and quickly killed him). The fighting on the perimeter of Dany‚Äôs forces slowly stops as well as they look up to the Red Keep. As Jon stares down remorsefully at Dany‚Äôs body, every person at KL bends the knee to Jon Snow. This would be a panoramic shot and close-ups on the main characters, like Arya, Sansa, Brienne, bending the knee. As an unfortunately necessary side note, they don&amp;#39;t have to go &amp;quot;full frontal&amp;quot; but Jon has to be in the nude, reborn, elemental when he survives the flames - he has to look the same way Dany looked. Putting tattered Hulk pants on him would cheapen the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(18) Jon kneels down and cradles Dany in the same way he had cradled Ygritte when she died. He knows what Dany had turned into but he nevertheless loved her, admired her, believed in her. He feels responsible for the loss of what could have been. He feels responsible for causing Dany&amp;#39;s descent into madness and her eventual death. He feels responsible for not foreseeing the Iron Fleet&amp;#39;s attack at Dragonstone, the death of Rhaegal, the capture and execution of Missandei, and the resulting rage of Dany and Greyworm. He feels regret for exposing his Targaryen secret to his sisters, which he realizes cascaded down to Tyrion and Varys and set off this chain of events. After a panoramic shot of the whole kingdom kneeling before Jon Snow on the elevated landing of the Red Keep, there is a cut to black. A little bit of time passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(19) Due to Tyrion‚Äôs actions, Arya did not fulfill Melisandre‚Äôs ‚Äúgreen eyes‚Äù prophecy by killing Cersei. This is symbolic of Arya‚Äôs shift away from a life of revenge/fate and toward a life of compassion (as she showed in Ep 5), leadership, and free will. That was such a great moment between Arya and the Hound in the last episode, so it must now be shown to have a lasting impact in the finale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(20) Jon, as he has always said, does not want the throne &amp;amp; renounces his rightful claim. He&amp;#39;s done with the South and life below the Wall. He&amp;#39;s been betrayed, murdered, and executed, he&amp;#39;s lost the two loves of his life, he&amp;#39;s lost his parents and siblings, and he&amp;#39;s fought battles against the living and the dead. His watch has ended. He&amp;#39;ll go beyond the wall with Tormund and Ghost; maybe he&amp;#39;ll live out his days like Tom Cruise at the end of the Last Samurai. Think of what Tormund said at the end of Episode 4 - Jon says Ghost will be happier up north and Tormund replies, ‚ÄúSo would you.‚Äù And Tormund&amp;#39;s last line to Jon: ‚ÄúYou got the north in you, the real north.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(21) So who ends up on the Iron Throne? We end up with Lord Gendry Baratheon (ironically now a Lord because of Dany&amp;#39;s actions a couple episodes ago) having the top claim to the throne. Some main characters like Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Davos, and Tyrion are seen convincing him to accept the throne, despite his reluctance. Gendry agrees but on one condition - that Arya be his queen, and he turns to look Arya in the eye after he says the line. Arya, now a changed person from the last time Gendry asked, happily agrees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(22) We have now come full circle to S1. We end with another Baratheon man loving a Stark woman - just like how Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark, which was the root of Robert‚Äôs Rebellion and everything we watched over the course of eight seasons. Except now this Stark woman (fortunately) loves this Baratheon man. In fact, when you step back and think about it, Arya/Gendry may be the longest, slow-burning love relationship in the entire show. What a perfectly fitting way to resolve that storyline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(23) Based on everything we&amp;#39;ve seen from Arya and Gendry during the show, we are left with the belief that their JOINT rule will be just, long, and respected by all citizens of the 7 Kingdoms. While we&amp;#39;ve been focused on one throne and one ruler this entire series, perhaps it was called the Game of THRONES for a reason. Two rulers, two thrones, two decent, experienced, hardened, compassionate members of two of the most likable houses in the 7 Kingdoms may be what&amp;#39;s needed to rebuild the realm, restore trust, and achieve long-term peace and prosperity. In a surprise twist, we end on a bittersweet yet hopeful note instead of a dark one. Spring is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FN1: Based on this show&amp;#39;s history, it is far more likely that my predictions are completely wrong and GOT is going to end on a dark note, or at least a hint of future darkness. I‚Äôve been trying to think of a side character we haven‚Äôt seen in awhile who might pop up in one additional final scene and give the audience a wink toward inevitable violence &amp;amp; rebellion after season‚Äôs end. It just seems like all such candidates are already dead, so I don&amp;#39;t see how it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FN2: When I say everyone in Westeros will show up to surround the Red Keep in the Finale, I mean everyone. You can bring in Essos people, too. Give us Yara Greyjoy. Give us an older Robin Arryn. Give us Jaqen H&amp;#39;ghar. Even better, give us Daario Naharas and place him with the people, even though it is visibly eating at his heart to be on that side. Have Dany see him in the crowd, and, instead of recognizing the folly of her ways, it only causes her to grow madder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does everyone think? That took far too long to type out but it was enjoyable. Now I&amp;#39;ll cross my fingers that I&amp;#39;m wrong in every possible way so that I can be fully surprised and moved by the finale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: Screw it - I will stubbornly and pigheadedly say that my ending was better. One big thing I was struggling with was how Tyrion would kill Dany because it would have been out-of-character for him to use a knife or sword. Then he pulled out the sharp &amp;quot;Hand of the Queen&amp;quot; brooch during the finale! That would have been perfect.]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'mod_note': None, 'likes': None, 'title': '[SPOILERS] A Theory for the Finale in 23 Parts: How the Show Will End with a Season 1 ""Reset"" &amp; the Clever Foreshadowing We\'ve Been Shown Along the Way', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'edited': 1558329735.0, 'quarantine': False, 'domain': 'self.gameofthrones', 'name': 't3_bpn83b', 'hidden': False, 'clicked': False, 'num_comments': 54, 'num_reports': None}]",,,self.gameofthrones,0,False,0,{},False,False,bq1w43,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,,,,[],,,dark,text,False,,{},False,,,,[],t3_bq1w43,False,0,0,,False,all_ads,/r/gottheories/comments/bq1w43/spoilers_a_theory_for_the_finale_in_23_parts_how/,False,,,6,False,,,False,9,,{},,,True,False,False,gottheories,t5_31sk0,r/gottheories,24308,public,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/JoziRKuKSHPRM5NBCGKAuTicpd_6ehG33FVfwxya4iQ.jpg,140.0,140.0,"[SPOILERS] A Theory for the Finale in 23 Parts: How the Show Will End with a Season 1 ""Reset"" &amp; the Clever Foreshadowing We've Been Shown Along the Way",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bpn83b/spoilers_a_theory_for_the_finale_in_23_parts_how/,[],,False,all_ads,6

Original Post :

There's a 2hour slot for HBO's Game of Thrones documentary The Last Watch on May 26.

2 hours is a long slot for BTS given we've been shown these inside the episodes all along the way. 

I believe this slot is going to include a hitherto unknown 7th episode (maybe only an hour?) to set all missing context after the big reveal at the end on Episode 6. That could be followed by the documentary. 

I kinda see the 2-3 major threads that can be tied up to conclude the whole thing sensibly and the only problem is the slow burn 80 mins we have this week to reach there. I see breadcrumbs of the ending all over and if it's true, it will be one (or better, two) of the most epic long cons pulled off in television history. 

The showmakers have been deviously lying about small things to set everyone off the track. And this is the final hype for a record breaking finale.

I completely understand why many people are dissatisfied with this season. 
Yes, the whole thing has been rushed.
Yes,  unless what we think was the third big twist didn't happen last week and wasn't Dany burning KL and is actually something that's gonna tie this whole thing up nicely that we TOTALLY didn't see coming, then the final season basically won't have any redemption. 
Buuuuut....There's bad writing and then there's bad writing. The show runners and writers have shown us plenty of times that they are AMAZING writers. They've produced episodes that could serve as standalone theatre quality movie releases. They've produced SEASONS that will go down in history as some of the best television ever. 
But they've always had a reason, however thin that reasoning may be. Whether it's a random throwback to a past season, or some offhand way that they feel the actors actions should've been interpreted but most everyone else didn't see it. 
But having Bran end up on the Iron Throne is just basically the stupidest thing that could happen. With the absolute bonkers exception of the possibility that he's just played everyone because he wanted it for himself, or felt he's the only one who could run it, why has it constantly been hammered home again and again that the 3ER doesn't want to rule anything? Doesn't need anything. Is there simply to serve as the history of men. It's been absolutely drilled into his character makeup and is basically WHAT HE IS. 
And I'm not talking about ""oh Jamie got built up to be such a good guy and should've been redeemed!"" Jamie started off by trying to murder a child. ""but he came such a long way towards being better!"" NO. He told Danny he'd do it all again exactly the same at Winterfell. He may have tried to be a better person, but in the end he admitted that he simply just wasn't a good guy. (ok. Maybe he comes back. Whatevs.) but here's obvs an out there where they could say ""nope he just didn't cut it as a good guy and couldn't get over Cersei and he broke Brienne's heart like he broke Bran's back""
Aside from Brian stating that he doesn't WANT any throne, but he pretty much is unable to take any throne, there also doesn't seem to be any precedent in the history of all the 3ER's where they've ever done anything for personal gain. 
So simply put my point is that no matter how sloppy this season has gotten. No matter how badly D+D want to get jumping on their new Star Wars project. There's simply no way they could even INTENTIONALLY write something that horrible. 
It literally makes zero sense. 
This is, of course going into the final episode and assuming that they're going to wrap up all the story lines neatly and come up with a somewhat coherent explanation for everything that's happened this season. 
What could possibly make bran want (be able to?) step up and take on the throne (which once again makes no sense in any form or fashion because they'd basically be saying nothing that happens in the past eight seasons matters). 
I can't see the writers making that the endgame, I can't see HBO green lighting that and saying ""yeah sounds good to us!"", they have simply put out too much phenomenal material to have this garbage storyline be their way to wrap up the plot. Soooo... 

Tinfoil time! : this is a HUGE mis-direct by somebody somewhere. 
These guys are playing the GAME themselves against us. I truly think they've taken the season and turned this entire beast of the Internet that has been such an integral component of the show's popularity since day one and played us all with it. 
I'm talking META-LEAKS.
Think about what it would take for anyone involved in this amazing show to end up with this storyline and be okay with it. It's too blatantly stupid to be real.

Dany is distraught. She's lost everyone close to her. Tyrion enters, tells her of betrayal. He winks at a key moment, holds back a smirk. Then she meets with Jon after Varys' execution. Jon glances at the fire, a reminder they are being watched.

Everybody would like to see Daenerys die. I think she's gonna live. I'll explain ...

The battle of King's Landing reminds me of the battle of Harrenhal When Aegon took over the power in Westeros by destroying the castle of Harrenhal. 

Remember Lady Olenna told Daenerys not to be a sheep but a dragon. That day finally arrived !!! 

King's Landing was everyhing we took from her and her family. Daenerys lost loved ones. Ser Jorah who was like a father, Missandei who was his friend and his confidante, his two children Vyserion and Rhaegal. 

I don't think she's mad. I think she's been guided by her rage. Why would you want her dead ? Seriously !

She fought her whole life. She helped the North ans was welcomed as a stranger. She didn't get a thank-you. Sansa tried it and convicted him. She doesn't feel like she's in all her efforts. 

She's finally gonna be queen for the seven kingdoms.

Arya's not gonna kill Daenerys. A lot thinks it's the Azor Ahai or the death reincarnation, oh stop !!! But this prophecy does not exist. She's only connected to the long night.

For the Jaime theory, some users mention James Hibberd's twitter comment regarding holding off Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's post-death interview as a sign that Jaime may not be dead. Taken as is, that may be plausible, but remember there is just one episode left, and many fans wanted him to be alive, and since his dead body was never actually shown, it was left as a kind of false hope possibility that he is still living. There was also the lack of goodbye to the character on the part of Coster-Waldau himself, as well as Lena Headey, and other castmates, like Gwendoline Christie. Plus, whenever, the cast talked about the scene of Cersei's death, it was always about Cersei's point of view, and how fitting the death was for that specific character. Jaime dying came secondary to Cersei, and was only mentioned insofar as the two came into the world together and left it together. Nothing more. I've mentioned this before, I think the lack of attention to Jaime in reaction to their deaths, and just the fact that he flat out dies then and there, completely binds him to Cersei and removes all agency he had. But that doesn't mean that a disappointing and somewhat confusing plot line cannot be true. Yes, we can certainly see these particular events and conclude that Jaime did not die. But we can just as logically look at these events and conclude that we're being played. The only difference is taking into consideration the very plausible, and actually precedented assumption, that everyone is lying to us. (Remember, they lied about Jon Snow's death). SO why not lie about lying?  Especially when so many fans need a reason to push their disappointment aside to actually watch the finale?

Now on to the White Walker Theory:

Same basic idea.

Remember D&amp;D went on Kimmel and for the question regarding the White Walkers, they refused to answer while looking a little pensive. Now, based on their other answers, namely that they responded ""possibly"" to every other question, and their tone regarding the White Walker question, one could infer that the dead still have a place in the finale. Again, however, I think they said it that way for suspense purposes, as like with Jaime's death, a lot of fans found the relatively quick destruction of the  long-surviving and frightening undead as rather disappointing. How can beings that have been around since before the Andals invaded Westeros, ones that have grown hundreds of thousands strong, were strategic enough to get a dragon and take down the ancient magic wall binding them to the far North, die so quickly? Even if Arya's Faceless training allowed her to kill the Night King thereby ending the undead army, as a plot line how did it come off so clean-cut? It *is* disappointing, and the show runners knew it would be. That is why they want the drama of a possible White Walker resurgence, they want people to come back, even if to just spend the hour and a half waiting to gain even a semblance of closure. Of course they never will, but that doesn't matter. It's not only the last season, but the last episode.

Obviously anyone on this forum is aware that the failure of the past 2 seasons has nothing to do with who was in team-Cersei vs team-Dany and everything to do with the fact that the people making the show seem to have no knowledge of the characters or the history of Westeros (and they also suck at lighting and timing).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the issues (community: please help add more in the comments).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Timing issues:
   1. Euron's magically transporting fleet. One second he's sinking the Unsullied's fleet; the next second he magically appears next to Yara's ship half a world away
   2. Gendry/Ravens/Dragons moving at the speed of light
2. Character failures:
   1. Bran's complete uselessness. The most powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing warg in the world sits in a chair for the entire battle with the night king.
   2. Dany transforms from noble to insane for no reason and with little prompting
   3. Tyrion (the clever one) has no ideas. The battle in the Long Night had zero intelligence/planning. Why did the Dothraki charge into darkness? How did half of them (any of them?) survive? Where was the Braveheart tarred fields? Where are the red witches to set everyone on fire? Why did nobody go after the White Walkers (journalists: those are the blue generals of the Night Kings army)?
   4. Varys (the one with all the spies) knew nothing about Euron's fleet
   5. Jamie going from noble back to evil with zero prompting
   6. Where was Meera Reed in the battle of the Long Night? Was there a contract issue?
3. Logical/Continuity Issues:
   1. Arya transports from a locked room in Winterfell to sneaking up on the Night King; a single stab kills him even though a full-throated fire from a dragon does nothing
   2. Dany doesn't see Euron's fleet from high up; he hits a flying target from a mile away with a crossbow on his first shot.
   3. Almost nobody shoots at Dany when she attacks the scorpions at King's landing even though dozens of them had clear shots
   4. A man who can raise the dead is coming, the safest place for everyone to hide is in .... a crypt? When all the dead rise, they kill tons of ppl but no one important
   5. Sam was dead meat 500x in the battle of the Long Night. His survival is an insult to the viewers.
   6. WTF were the wights (journalists: those are the zombies) doing in the library with Arya? Did they think they were in Barnes and Noble ?
4. Chekhov's gun (aka Unanswered Questions):
   1. Bran
   2. Dorne
   3. Jaqn H'ghar
   4. Dire wolves
   5. What did the Night King want? Why is he coming back now? How was Arya able to kill him so easily? Where are the giant spiders ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zECQXn6yFms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zECQXn6yFms) )?
   6. Why did Dany destroy King's Landing? If she wanted to destroy it, why wouldn't she start with the Red Keep?
   7. Why does Mellisandre kill herself? Where are the rest of the red witches?
   8. What's up with the Weirwood trees? Where are the Children of the forest?
   9. How did the Children of the Forest defeat the Night King 8,000 years ago?
      1. This is a great example of what they should have done with Bran instead of the first 2 pointless episodes of Season 8","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some confusion amongst journalists who write articles saying &amp;quot;A million people signed a petition that says Season 8 blows; I guess you can&amp;#39;t please all the people all the time.

&lt;p&gt;(3) ‚Äú...he will wrap his hands around your throat and choke the life from you...‚Äù when Jamie puts his hands around her throat she is overwhelmed and crying and chanting something along the lines of ‚ÄúI want to live! I want to live! I want our baby to live! I want our baby to live!‚Äù Jamie wraps his hands around her throat and is strong for them both and comforts her and assures her that death is eminent but that they came into life together, they‚Äôll leave together. Using love He relieves her of her frantic denial of her impending death so that she may have a moment of peace and love before she dies. He ‚Äúchokes the life out of her‚Äù by using love to help her be at peace with her death in the last seconds before it comes, so that they can embrace and die in each other‚Äôs arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like all best written prophecies, by the rule of how to write prophecies, you don‚Äôt REALLY know what it means until it‚Äôs happened&lt;/p&gt;

But when you find out that Aerys had given the command to ""burn them all"", his actions seem noble.  

Similarly, we see Dany's face, but we don't know what's going through her mind. We don't see what she sees. We don't know what she knows.  What if she knows that Cersei has wired King's Landing the way she wired the Sept of Baelor? What if she knows that Cersei is just waiting for Dany's army to flood into King's Landing before igniting all of the wildfire and burning a million innocent people along with Dany's army while she flees to the safety of Maegor's Holdfast.

Jon discovers that Arya murdered Dany for no reason and has to execute her himself (hearken back to the first episode and Jon is forced to swing the sword after he passes judgment).

So, the simplified version of the Azor Ahai prophecy is this - 

Darkness lay over the world, and Azor Ahai is destined to fight it. In order to do so, the hero forges a sword...

The sword is tempered in water, and it breaks

The second time, the hero tempers the sword by killing a lion, but again the steel shatters

Finally, the hero drives the sword into the heart of his lover - which successfully creates light-bringer

Now, let‚Äôs think about Season 8 episode 5 - where we see Danny decimate Kings  Landing with Drogon... 

At least, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre led to believe.

Interestingly enough, we never hear Danny say ‚ÄúDracarys‚Äù - and once Drogon starts spitting fire, we don‚Äôt see Danny‚Äôs face for the rest of the episode. 

So what if Danny isn‚Äôt the one that burned down King‚Äôs landing - what if she lost control of her dragon, and Drogon was the one that went on a rampage?

A rampage that Danny had no way to stop. 

Now how does this relate to the prophecy? 

Tempered the sword in water, but it fails  (Dany destroying the entire Greyjoy fleet?) 

Tempered the sword through the heart of a lion, but it fails (Danny drove both Jaime and Cersei to their death, or maybe she‚Äôll be executing Tyrion next episode?) 

All that‚Äôs left is to drive the sword through the heart of a loved one... 

What if Danny, because of Drogons destruction of King‚Äôs landing, is forced to kill her dragon? The last of her children, and arguably the being she loves most (other than Jon).

And through killing Drogon, Danny forges Light-Bringer... 

Now the question becomes - who is she to use it against if she isn‚Äôt the final threat? Maybe Bran?

*Or better yet, make it 9 seasons. Make GoT great again, I promise you.*

**Aftermath of King's Landing destruction and the Cleansing Crusade**

Daenerys  takes over the Seven Kingdoms and crowns herself Queen. Tyrion is  disgusted with her actions and resigns as Hand of the Queen but is  locked up to be dealt with at a later date.

Unsullied and Dothraki  remain loyal and act as enforcers with Greyworm captain of the Guard  and Hand of the Queen, everyone else defects. Jon Snow formally starts  calling himself Aegon Targaryen. His group of rebels start calling  themselves ""The Exiled Ones"" and leave King's Landing to return at a  later date when they are stronger.

Dany totally flips when all  kingdoms reject her claim to the throne and begins what she calls the  Cleansing Crusade. If nobody will accept her rule, then she will burn  everything in her path and remake the Seven Kingdoms in her own way from  scratch. Over the coming years many towns, villages and keeps will fall  to the might of her army and her last living dragon. Sometimes her  advancement is postponed by wounding her dragon, but it is only a matter  of months, years at best until the Crusade resumes. The true Long Night  has come, the sun no longer shines in Westeros, winter will be here to  stay for a generation.

Greyworm is tasked with tracking down the  Exiled Ones who go into hiding. Over the years they are discovered and  each time they have to flee and the recycle repeats. At some point the  group will reunite with Sansa, Brienne and Samwell Tarly.

An old  crone will come to Aegon and beg him to travel east to the Shadow Lands  in Asshai where salvation lies. This is later revealed to be Melisandra  reborn who thinks she has failed humanity once before and doesn't want  fail again. In Asshai, Aegon will find the weapon needed to end Dany's  reign of terror for good: the artifact Dragonbinder. At this point, 20  years have passed and half of Westeros has been destroyed. Attacks have  also begun in Essos against the free cities who would dare aiding the  refugees in defiance of the Mad Queen.

**The Battle of Asshai**

Some  time later Asshai is attacked by a group of Unsullied and Dothraki  intent on killing Aegon who's been discovered yet again. They are  defeated but their commander, presumed to be Greyworm at first glance,  challenges Aegon to a one on one fight. Aegon accepts.

However  once the challenger takes off his Unsullied helmet it is revealed that  he is neither Unsullied nor Dothraki, but a Westerosi, a traitor in  Aegon's eyes who sided with the Mad Queen against his own people.

""Can  you know victory without first knowing defeat? Come! Fail! Die!"" the  traitor taunts him. Aegon dismisses his ramblings and attacks.

The  two duel for 24 hours straight as thousands watch until Aegon, despite  being badly wounded, gets the upper hand. The traitor is weakened but  he's not done yet, he taunts Aegon a final time saying ""You think you've  won? You will know the taste of defeat, even if it means my own death!  You know nothing, Aegon Targaryen! Nothing but ash will be left where we  stand!""

Bran sensing that something is off calls to Aegon ""No! You musn't kill him! Stop!""

Too  little too late as Aegon is unable to hear him from the sounds of the  cheering crowd and finally plunges his blade into the mysterious  stranger's chest, sealing his fate. ""Dracarys... mother!"" Aerys III  Targaryen says as he goes down, the adult son of Aegon and Daenerys. A  letter from the Mad Queen found in his pouch later confirms his true  identity. In her madness, Dany had forced Aegon's hand against their  only child.

Aegon is broken inside but stands firm wishing to fulfill the promise made to his people.

""We are going home!""

**The Final Confrontation**

The  Exiles Ones return to Westeros stronger than before and comes across  some rebels from the Brotherhood Without Banners in the wilderness near  King's Landing who have been fighting Dany's reign for decades at this  point. The rebels resent Aegon for leaving, but soon follow him. Using  their connections they agree to cause a distraction to get Dany away  from the capital long enough for Aegon to secure what remains of the Red  Keep. The plan works. With Dany gone, Aegon takes a smaller group to  infiltrate the Red Keep. They find an older Tyrion and Ellaria Sand, the  only surviving prisoner from Cersei's rule, still alive and the two  join the fight. Dany had kept Tyrion alive mentally torturing him,  promising to kill him last once his beloved Westeros was completely  destroyed. The Unsullied guarding the Red Keep along with Greyworm was  killed.

In his dying breath Greyworm confesses to his atrocities,  he had become disillusioned with Dany over the years but he never  believed Dany could be stopped. Aegon forgives him and he dies at peace,  knowing Dany's reign will soon be at an end.

They put  Dragonbinder into position atop the Red Keep ready to use against Dany's  dragon Drogon. Reading the inscription on the artifact Samwell Tarly  makes a shocking discovery that nobody knew about. Whoever uses  Dragonbinder will die, his or her lungs turning to coal. Someone will  need to make the ultimate sacrifice to stop the Mad Queen.

""At least we've done all we can,"" Bran says with relief.

People  prepare to take cover in case anything goes wrong. Melisandra would do  it as she is dying anyway but her body is tainted by too much dark magic  for it to work. She knows the honorable Ser Davos would if he were here  but he died years ago. The soldiers are trying to decide on who should  sacrifice himself, but a single brave young man steps forward to blow  the Dragonbinder. Aegon pushes him out of the way.

""My king? But...""

""Every choice, every sacrifice has lead me to this moment... to face her!"" Aegon says.

""You... you're not coming with us?"" a tearful Samwell Tarly asks.

""Jon? What are you doing?"" Bran asks, one of the few people close to Aegon that are still allowed to use his old name.

""The Iron Throne is nothing without a ruler. Did you not see this fate, prophet?"" he says with a bittersweet smile.

""Our freedom was never in fate's hands..."" Bran replies ""Farewell, Jon Snow. Now you know everything.""

Aegon hugs his family and friends one last time before facing Daenerys.

""Dracarys!"" she says ready to burn Aegon to death. Too late.

""Auntie, your crusade... is over!"" he taunts her blowing the Dragonbinder and sealing both their fate.

""No!""  she says as she is knocked off Drogon. The dragon now loyal to Aegon  destroys what remains of the Dothraki and Unsullied forces who were  preparing to storm the Red Keep and help their queen. A wounded Dany  limps over to her throne. Arya comes out cover to deliver the killing  blow.

""You're the last on my list you know, you have been for a  long time, as my friend once said, I've been chasing vengeance all my  life,"" she says.

Dany doesn't say anything but Arya sees the anger and resentment in her green eyes.

""No,"" a dying Aegon says, ""the one who passes judgement should swing the sword...""

If  this was anyone else she might have protested being denied yet another  kill, in the end she figured everyone had their own little lists... and  this was definitely even more personal. Arya decided to leave Dany alone  with Aegon in their final moments.

""We could have been so much more than just subject and Queen, Jon... Traitor...""

""My name... is Aegon Targeryan... and you are not my Queen. You've never been a Queen.""

Dany sheds a tear hearing him say that.

""Promise me no harm will come to Drogon,"" she pleads with Aegon knowing death is near.

""You  know I'm an honest man, so you must know that's not going to happen.  You lost your right to make demands when you sent your own son, our son,  to die by my hands.""

""Was it all for nothing, Jon?"" Dany asked, tears running down her cheeks...

""No, the wheel will be broken, Dany"" and with that he delivered the killing blow.

**Conclusion**

After  killing Dany he collapsed on the floor next to Dany's body, shorter of  breath with each passing moment. Drogon flew over to check up on him.  Soldiers and archers gathered around Drogon. With his last breath he  said only one word before finally succumbing to the deadly effects of  the Dragonbinder: ""Dracarys!""

The dragon then melted the Iron  Throne and reduced both Dany and Aegon's bodies to ash, her dead body no  longer immune to fire as it had been in life. Their ashes scattered  almost immediately upon the winds, making their way to the Narrow Sea.  Drogon, still loyal to Aegon's side thanks to the powerful enchantments  of the Dragonbinder, did not resist when the soldiers put him down, his  body destroyed to ensure no possibility that dragons, living or  otherwise, would ever fly in Westeros.

In the aftermath Bran, Tyrion, Sansa and many other survivors formed a transitional council and abolished the monarchy.

The  Republic of Westeros emerged out of the smoldering ruins of the Seven  Kingdoms and due to the seismic shifts in power the Iron Bank filed for  bankruptcy later that year.

Though the game of thrones was over,  in time a new war would start between the free cities of Essos and the  Republic of Westeros over a newly discovered resource in the far east  Shadow Lands following Aegon and his people's exodus: the Assharite. War  never changes.

*And yes this is a shameless ripoff of another franchise. Hey, at least I didn't charge you money for it and I wrote a better ending than we'll really get and I did it all for free.*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay so Season 8 has been kinda disappointing so far, here&amp;#39;s how the final episode can salvage it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or better yet, make it 9 seasons. Make GoT great again, I promise you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ending should be called&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Throne&amp;#39;s End&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath of King&amp;#39;s Landing destruction and the Cleansing Crusade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys  takes over the Seven Kingdoms and crowns herself Queen. Tyrion is  disgusted with her actions and resigns as Hand of the Queen but is  locked up to be dealt with at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsullied and Dothraki  remain loyal and act as enforcers with Greyworm captain of the Guard  and Hand of the Queen, everyone else defects.

His group of rebels start calling  themselves &amp;quot;The Exiled Ones&amp;quot; and leave King&amp;#39;s Landing to return at a  later date when they are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany totally flips when all  kingdoms reject her claim to the throne and begins what she calls the  Cleansing Crusade. If nobody will accept her rule, then she will burn  everything in her path and remake the Seven Kingdoms in her own way from  scratch. Over the coming years many towns, villages and keeps will fall  to the might of her army and her last living dragon.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; a dying Aegon says, &amp;quot;the one who passes judgement should swing the sword...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  this was anyone else she might have protested being denied yet another  kill, in the end she figured everyone had their own little lists... and  this was definitely even more personal. Arya decided to leave Dany alone  with Aegon in their final moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We could have been so much more than just subject and Queen, Jon... Traitor...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My name... is Aegon Targeryan... and you are not my Queen. You&amp;#39;ve never been a Queen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany sheds a tear hearing him say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Promise me no harm will come to Drogon,&amp;quot; she pleads with Aegon knowing death is near.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You  know I&amp;#39;m an honest man, so you must know that&amp;#39;s not going to happen.  You lost your right to make demands when you sent your own son, our son,  to die by my hands.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was it all for nothing, Jon?&amp;quot; Dany asked, tears running down her cheeks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, the wheel will be broken, Dany&amp;quot; and with that he delivered the killing blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After  killing Dany he collapsed on the floor next to Dany&amp;#39;s body, shorter of  breath with each passing moment. Drogon flew over to check up on him.  Soldiers and archers gathered around Drogon. With his last breath he  said only one word before finally succumbing to the deadly effects of  the Dragonbinder: &amp;quot;Dracarys!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon then melted the Iron  Throne and reduced both Dany and Aegon&amp;#39;s bodies to ash, her dead body no  longer immune to fire as it had been in life. Their ashes scattered  almost immediately upon the winds, making their way to the Narrow Sea.  Drogon, still loyal to Aegon&amp;#39;s side thanks to the powerful enchantments  of the Dragonbinder, did not resist when the soldiers put him down, his  body destroyed to ensure no possibility that dragons, living or  otherwise, would ever fly in Westeros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath Bran, Tyrion, Sansa and many other survivors formed a transitional council and abolished the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  Republic of Westeros emerged out of the smoldering ruins of the Seven  Kingdoms and due to the seismic shifts in power the Iron Bank filed for  bankruptcy later that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the game of thrones was over,  in time a new war would start between the free cities of Essos and the  Republic of Westeros over a newly discovered resource in the far east  Shadow Lands following Aegon and his people&amp;#39;s exodus: the Assharite. War  never changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yes this is a shameless ripoff of another franchise. Hey, at least I didn&amp;#39;t charge you money for it and I wrote a better ending than we&amp;#39;ll really get and I did it all for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To start, the ""Daenerys becomes the Night Queen"" is obviously not my original theory; I have seen it in different places across reddit. 

If Daenerys does get killed by Jon in the next episode (as several sources are predicting), I have seen the theory that, if stabbed in the heart by him with an obsidian dagger, perhaps she could become the Night Queen (Drogon takes her ""dead"" body far north, and, perhaps without anyone noticing, she becomes a white walker, and the cycle restarts - a new dead army building, etc). 

This would be somewhat coherent with the leaks.

Now, here's what I think: Dany becoming the Night Queen is exactly what the 3ER and the Children would have wanted; that is why Bran has ""helped"" and played the pieces and everyone along the way so they could get to this point (this is also a theory I've seen around here - that the 3ER is playing everyone - I just wouldn't say he's a ""villain"" exactly).  

It doesn't make sense to me that Bran would ""side"" with anyone or be on anyone's side as he's not Bran anymore (and no, he's not the Night King), he's the three eyed raven, and he serves the purposes of the 3ER and the Children (translating: nature itself). And perhaps their purpose is precisely the balance between fire and ice, and perhaps for that balance it is necessary that winter and death and the white walkers would exist. 

This seems to me like the overall message, the constant battle and struggle of life (fire) both against itself (see the game of thrones and the power struggle) and against the more explicit enemy death (ice). The Wall represents how humans do anything in their power to keep death at bay and away, this is part of the struggle of preserving life that we go through; without the fear of death and struggle against death there's no life (nature is founded precisely on this constant struggle - it's not the harmonious beautiful thing we usually attribute it to, it's grit, struggle, blood, fear, power, death as much as it is life). 


Daenerys went dead inside the moment she felt like she lost everything and was absolutely unwanted and unloved (yes, sounds cliche, but bear with me), she went cold out of resentment and bitterness and torched everything out of feeling vulnerable and powerless (compensating by showing power). This represents life turning cold, and the stab in the heart (the heart is not an arbitrary choice - think of what a stab in the heart means) is the final blow to an already hopeless and isolated human being. That leads to the final turn into a cold, lifeless, death driven creature that seeks the revenge against all that is light and living. Daenerys would be psychologically the perfect candidate for the Night Queen, and I wonder if we knew the further details of how the Night King was created, this kind of motivation wouldn't be more clear (this is what the show failed to well, show).


Edit: This could also point to Daenerys representing the whole concept of ""a song of ice and fire"". The fact that she would be the literal representation of fire (A Targaryen) and then ice could show how the walkers aren't so far away from us or a totally different reality, and how we all have the potential to turn ""cold"" and vengeful and death-motivated (destructive), something like that. How ice and fire are perhaps one in the same. Sorry I'm tripping hahahah

Lady Olenna was Baelish's partner all along. Since the day they killed Joffrey till her dying day. I'm gonna explain their plan in this comment. First, here's a few proof(foreshadowing); 


Here Varys tells Olenna 'he would watch this country burn if he could be the King of ashes. Olenna answers 'You're a clever man, Lord Varys. Look her expression. She is so impressed. Because she realizes Varys onto something. He knows Baelish would change(burn) everything.  (https://youtu.be/tfIUa81eRik?t=169 2:49)


Here Olenna tells Baelish 'I should've known you would RETURN to the CAPITAL as soon as THINGS STARTED TO GO WRONG.'  She knows Baelish wants chaos. He wants everything to go wrong (and system to go down) so he can return and change the whole system. 'AS SOON AS THINGS STARTED TO GO WRONG.' Everything went wrong in the capital in 8x5. System is down. It's perfect opportunity for Baelish to RETURN. (https://youtu.be/V3PSTvAbfac?t=72 1:12) In this one she also says 'I PROMISE YOU LORD BAELISH THAT OUR FAITHS ARE JOINED'. 


Together they manipulated Sansa, Varys, Daenerys and Jon Snow. Baelish knew Jon was a Targaryen all along. The day Daenerys called him to bend the knee Baelish and Olenna started to execute the plan. The plan;


The plan is to create a uber family protector...like Sansa. So she would never trust a stranger... A stranger like DAENERYS. He played his 'little' game over Arya. So Sansa would go super protective over her family. She would become so paranoid about strangers. Baelish did it. And didn't die.(you know how)  'That's what you've always done.. Turn family against family. Turn sister against sister...' (https://youtu.be/l3hTmUKR7LI?t=262 4:22)

Jon returned to Winterfell with a dangerous stranger... Daenerys. Sansa always thought she was manipulating Jon. 'Tell me, who manipulated whom...'

At then plan worked. Bran, of course, with his speical abilities learnt the truth (Baelish knew this would happen. He knew Bran's power. 'Chaos is a ladder') He told the truth about Jon. And Jon told to his whole family including Sansa. Baelish knew she wouldn't keep this secret. Because, now she wants her family's good. And Jon, as the King of Seven Kingdom's... would be the best for her family. She told Tyrion, and Tyrion told Varys...

They wanted Dany mad because she was the 'one'. The one to 'break the wheel'.  She was the one to fuck the system. She had 3 dragons. And big ass army. She could destroy the whole system easily. But they needed her MAD! Luckily, Cersei was her opponent. MADDEST BITCH in the Seven Kingdoms. To destroy such a mad one... you have to go more mad. That's why they supported Lannister so it would be harder to defeat Cersei without going mad. Do you know how Cersei was able to buy Golden Company? WITH GOLDS OF HOUSE TYRELL! They didn't even show the battle. It was a piece of cake for Lannisters to win because Lady Olenna didn't even try. Because her family was already gone and she had nothing to lost. She did her last duty and tried to drive Dany mad.   
We all know Olenna did her best to corrupt Dany. 'Peace...Do you think that's what we had under your father. Or his father...Peace never lasts my dear...' 'You are a dragon. Be a dragon.' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnNnebJkK44)


It went as it planned. But how were they gonna defeat the MADDEST bitch Daenerys? Whole Seven Kingdom's have to unite behind someone to defeat Dany. Someone....like Jon Snow..no. Because he never wanted it. He was never meant to be the King. Baelish knew this. From the moment Jon became the King in the North. 'We need the King in the north IN THE NORTH.' 'You all chose me as your leader. But I never wanted it. I never asked for it. All I ever wanted to protect the North.' 

But still they need to unite all Seven Kingdom. Against Mad Bitch. How? With a little bit of help from an old friend...Lord Varys. Baelish always knew Varys wanted 'Realms good'. He knew Varys would never tolerate a 'Mad Queen'. There was no doubt in Baelish' mind Master of Whispers would learn the true parantage of Jon Targaryen. He did. And Daenerys went mad. He wrote thousands of  
messages to the realm about 'True Heir Aegon Targaryen'. And they will unite against Mad Queen.Ôªø","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is not gonna happen. Just hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;

I was just thinking of this, Viserys always used the term, ""Don't wake the dragon."" This implied him getting angry, losing his shit and taking it out on people. Well what if the Azor Ahai prophecy didn't mean literally waking a dragon from stone, but what if Dany is ""the dragon"" from the prophecy and Jon snow woke the dragon, possibly in her stone heart (cause of all her recent loses and the way she reacts to violence) by rejecting her and that was the final straw for her to lose her shit and take her anger out on innocent people. Jon Snow would be fulfilling that part of the prophecy. Seems kind of deliberate to me.

There are tons of theories out there on how Jon fits the rest of the prophecy so I won't go into those, this one always seemed to point directly at Dany though, idk.

I also liked this theory on how Jon fits the ""Born under a bleeding star"" part, [http://www.asoiaf-theories.com/jon-snow-is-azor-ahai-born-underneath-a-bleeding-star/](http://www.asoiaf-theories.com/jon-snow-is-azor-ahai-born-underneath-a-bleeding-star/)

The battle against the Dothraki begins, the snow storm happens, cuts off Dany and Drogon.\n\nThe army of the living is trying to retreat but the second moat needs to be lit in order to relieve them. Dany is still lost in the snow storm. Rhaegal has landed and is firing randomly at wights. Jamie and Arya try to approach Rhaegal separately, but he snaps at both of them.  Then Jon approaches and after a tense moment, Rhaegal bows to let him mount.\n\nJon lights the second moat, cutting off the wights again and allowing time for the army to retreat.\n\nIn the crypts, the dead rise, we see Rickon, what could be Lyanna, a headless corpse that might be Ned Stark. Tyrion is attacked and Sansa has the chance to go back for him or run. She hesitates, but saves him. Gilly is killed protecting baby Sam, who she slumps over on top of, hiding him. Sansa and Tyrion are separated and she comes across Missandei fighting off several wights. She helps fight them off, then reaches out her hand. Missandei takes it and together they fight their way through the resurrected Starks. They think they‚Äôve made it out, smile at one another, then Missandei is stabbed and killed.\n\nThe wights break through the fire moat by piling atop it. Jorah and Lyanna are killed. Brienne, Jaime, Greyworm, the Hound, Theon, Samwell and Ed retreat to the Godswood to protect Bran. The white walker generals arrive with the Night King and an epic battle ensues. For a few minutes you just see character after beloved character get cut down by the white walker generals. One of the Generals lunges for Bran and Jaime is killed protecting him. Brienne kills the General in rage. Another White Walker General tries to get to Bran while Brienne is distracted, Theon throws himself between them and dies defending Bran. Brienne notices Arya amidst the chaos and understands what she plans to do. Brienne sacrifices herself to distract the Night King and give Arya a clear shot at him. Arya kills the Night King.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Episode 4**\n\nThe episode starts with northerners at Winterfell whispering and exchanging rumours, ‚Äòhe rode the dragon‚Äô we overhear.\n\nThe survivors bury the dead at Winterfell in a scene very similar to the original but with more fatalities.\n\nThe wildlings go back North, with plans to settle at Castle Black.\n\nBefore Jon leaves for the battle at King‚Äôs Landing, he tells Sansa and Arya who he is. Arya insists on joining the Northern army as they head South. Sansa refuses to let her go, but Arya reassures her that ‚ÄòWinterfell doesn‚Äôt need me, not as long as they have you‚Äô. Jon hugs Ghost and instructs him to stay by Arya‚Äôs side and protect her as he rides Rhaegal.\n\nHe and Dany ride south then stop on a cliff to wait for the others. They speak for the first time since she found out his true heritage. Jon tells her he loves her, and if she is willing to accept him as her consort, she will always be his Queen. He says he is tired of leading. Dany is still a bit unsure, but when Jon proposes himself as her consort, she can‚Äôt help but smile, and the two embrace, declaring they love each other for the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Episode 5**\n\nOpening scene is Melisandre arriving at the beach that Ser Davos and Tyrion arrived at that time at King‚Äôs Landing.\n\nThe battle for King‚Äôs Landing commences, Euron‚Äôs fleet is destroyed and he tries to flee King's Landing.  Jon and Dany ride dragons, burn fleet and outer walls and army. Arya leaves the rest of the army and pulls a small pouch from her pocket. Greyworm is killed.\n\nEuron tries to kill Tyrion but Bronn intervenes, ‚Äòno one‚Äôs killing him until I get my castle‚Äô Bronn and Euron fight. Yara has sailed the Iron Fleet to King‚Äôs Landing and interrupts their fight, declaring ‚Äòhe‚Äôs mine‚Äô about Euron. There is a brief flirtation between Yara and Bronn, ‚Äòmake sure you come find me when you‚Äôre done‚Äô\n\nThe next scene is Cersei watching the Iron Fleet burn. She sees Drogon approaching, turns to leave, then sees 'Jaime' at the bottom of the stairs. She dismisses the Mountain and Qyburn. As soon as she does, she crumbles to the floor, sobbing, 'Jaime' approaches her slowly.\n\nCleganebowl happens in a similar fashion to the original, Sandor burning his brother to death and then dying himself.\n\nJaime is in fact Arya, she stole his face after the battle of Winterfell. Cersei looks genuinely terrified. Arya confronts her, ‚ÄòThis is for my father, for my mother, for Robb, for my sister, for Rickon. All of it because of you and your family‚Äô Arya stabs her, ‚ÄòThe Starks send their regards‚Äô\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Episode 6**\n\nDaenerys‚Äô army is on the cusp of victory. She lands Drogon in the red keep, but Qyburn shoots the prototype scorpion at him. Qyburn is engulfed with flames but not in time to stop the Scorpion spear going through Drogon‚Äôs throat, killing him slowly and painfully. Dany is so shocked and upset that she goes into labour, never knowing she was pregnant. Jon sees Drogon dying and rushes to Dany.\n\nDany has a complicated birth, she deliver a baby boy on the steps of the Red Keep. The baby boy is tiny and extremely premature. The boy dies, and Dany is hysterical. Melisandre arrives and begins to tend to Dany, but she insists Melisandre helps her son instead. Melisandre resurrects the baby, using the last of her energy and dying in the process. Dany is bleeding to death, ‚ÄòPromise me‚Äô she begs Jon as he holds their son, ‚ÄòPromise me he will sit on the Iron Throne, promise me a Targaryen will sit on the Iron Throne‚Äô\n\nJon promises, as Dany dies.\n\nJon takes the Iron Throne, begrudgingly, to secure his son, Prince Rhaegar‚Äôs, place. He becomes King Aegon Targaryen, sixth of his name. Jon grants the North its independence and Sansa becomes Queen in the North, with Ed as her Master at Arms. Varys, Bran, Samwell (Lord of Horn Hill), Davos and Tyrion (Lord of Casterley Rock) make up the new small council. Little Sam is raised at King‚Äôs Landing alongside Prince Rhaegar. Bronn gets his castle (Highgarden). Arya becomes a member of the King‚Äôs Guard and the Master at Arms in King‚Äôs Landing, training young nobility and eventually Prince Rhaegar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe final scene is Jon concluding a small council meeting, and everyone leaving. Bran stays a moment, looks at Jon. Jon closes the door behind the other council members, and says quietly, 'take me back'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBran hesitates, 'Again your grace...?'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Please Bran...'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen goes black and we hear the words spoken by Rhaegar and Lyanna, 'Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger...'"", 'media': None, 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/freefolk', 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'send_replies': True, 'is_original_content': False, 'report_reasons': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'allow_live_comments': False, 'link_flair_css_class': 'purple', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'created_utc': 1558037711.0, 'spoiler': False, 'secure_media': None, 'discussion_type': None, 'user_reports': [], 'permalink': '/r/freefolk/comments/bphioe/alternative_ending_for_got_season_8_rewritten/', 'is_video': False, 'hide_score': False, 'link_flair_text': 'Freefolk', 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'author': 'gameofbones91', 'content_categories': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'archived': False, 'subreddit_id': 't5_37tpy', 'total_awards_received': 1, 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'pinned': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'mod_reports': [], 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'gildings': {'gid_2': 1}, 'media_embed': {}, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'author_fullname': 't2_2ergvbnc', 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'is_meta': False, 'visited': False, 'distinguished': None, 'contest_mode': False, 'pwls': 6, 'wls': 6, 'can_gild': False, 'approved_at_utc': None, 'no_follow': False, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'score': 70, 'link_flair_template_id': 'b18bb2de-f7c0-11e5-91d8-0e1f6820d4a9', 'saved': False, 'all_awardings': [{'icon_height': 512, 'subreddit_id': None, 'name': 'Gold', 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'id': 'gid_2', 'days_of_premium': 7, 'award_type': 'global', 'icon_width': 512, 'coin_price': 500, 'count': 1, 'coin_reward': 100, 'resized_icons': [{'width': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'height': 16}, {'width': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'height': 32}, {'width': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'height': 48}, {'width': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'height': 64}, {'width': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'height': 128}], 'description': 'Gold Award', 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'is_enabled': True}], 'media_only': False, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'id': 'bphioe', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1101952, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bphioe/alternative_ending_for_got_season_8_rewritten/', 'approved_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'subreddit': 'freefolk', 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'is_self': True, 'suggested_sort': None, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an alternative end written by myself based on what I would have liked to see, very interested to hear what others think or what else they might change!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì keep as they were except &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; dragon ride for Jon Snow&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similar opening but as the battle commences the dragons swoop in first and burn a fuckload of wights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a fire moat around the entire army protecting them‚Ä¶ Night King swoops down on viserion and uses blue flames, turning the fire moat blue, which wights are immune to so they can now walk through it. The battle against the Dothraki begins, the snow storm happens, cuts off Dany and Drogon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The army of the living is trying to retreat but the second moat needs to be lit in order to relieve them. Dany is still lost in the snow storm. Rhaegal has landed and is firing randomly at wights. Jamie and Arya try to approach Rhaegal separately, but he snaps at both of them.  Then Jon approaches and after a tense moment, Rhaegal bows to let him mount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jon lights the second moat, cutting off the wights again and allowing time for the army to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the crypts, the dead rise, we see Rickon, what could be Lyanna, a headless corpse that might be Ned Stark. Tyrion is attacked and Sansa has the chance to go back for him or run. She hesitates, but saves him. Gilly is killed protecting baby Sam, who she slumps over on top of, hiding him. Sansa and Tyrion are separated and she comes across Missandei fighting off several wights. She helps fight them off, then reaches out her hand. Missandei takes it and together they fight their way through the resurrected Starks. They think they‚Äôve made it out, smile at one another, then Missandei is stabbed and killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wights break through the fire moat by piling atop it. Jorah and Lyanna are killed. Brienne, Jaime, Greyworm, the Hound, Theon, Samwell and Ed retreat to the Godswood to protect Bran. The white walker generals arrive with the Night King and an epic battle ensues. For a few minutes you just see character after beloved character get cut down by the white walker generals. One of the Generals lunges for Bran and Jaime is killed protecting him. Brienne kills the General in rage. Another White Walker General tries to get to Bran while Brienne is distracted, Theon throws himself between them and dies defending Bran. Brienne notices Arya amidst the chaos and understands what she plans to do. Brienne sacrifices herself to distract the Night King and give Arya a clear shot at him. Arya kills the Night King.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The episode starts with northerners at Winterfell whispering and exchanging rumours, ‚Äòhe rode the dragon‚Äô we overhear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The survivors bury the dead at Winterfell in a scene very similar to the original but with more fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wildlings go back North, with plans to settle at Castle Black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before Jon leaves for the battle at King‚Äôs Landing, he tells Sansa and Arya who he is.

So the children of the forest created the Night King (the one we know and love) to protect them against the first men, but it somehow got out of control and just wanted everything to die. Possibly something was wrong with the magic, or with the person they captured and turned into the Night King. 

The drawings that Jon and Dany find by Dragonstone show a White Walker with a crown, but also with a beard. Perhaps our Night King shaved before his big appearance, perhaps there was another one. 

Somebody should correct me on this, but didn't the original Azor Ahai temper his sword three times. The first time he used water, and it failed (Dragonstone is on an island in the middle of the water, where the drawings are) The second time he captured a lion and it shattered (like our Night King) and the third time, when it worked, he had to drive it through his lover's heart. 

So I'm thinking that somehow there's a little magic left in Westeros, and Jon is told by a little bird (or raven) how he can sacrifice himself, giving him the power of the White Walker (raise the dead, being immune to fucking dragon fire). This time, however, because Jon is doing it willingly, he doesn't want to kill everything, just Dany and Drogon.

After the deed is done Jon returns to the far North.

His is the Song of Ice and Fire.

Ghost lives forever.

The end.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a thought...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the children of the forest created the Night King (the one we know and love) to protect them against the first men, but it somehow got out of control and just wanted everything to die. Possibly something was wrong with the magic, or with the person they captured and turned into the Night King. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawings that Jon and Dany find by Dragonstone show a White Walker with a crown, but also with a beard. Perhaps our Night King shaved before his big appearance, perhaps there was another one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody should correct me on this, but didn&amp;#39;t the original Azor Ahai temper his sword three times. The first time he used water, and it failed (Dragonstone is on an island in the middle of the water, where the drawings are) The second time he captured a lion and it shattered (like our Night King) and the third time, when it worked, he had to drive it through his lover&amp;#39;s heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m thinking that somehow there&amp;#39;s a little magic left in Westeros, and Jon is told by a little bird (or raven) how he can sacrifice himself, giving him the power of the White Walker (raise the dead, being immune to fucking dragon fire). This time, however, because Jon is doing it willingly, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to kill everything, just Dany and Drogon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the deed is done Jon returns to the far North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His is the Song of Ice and Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to think of what could be a realistic and bittersweet/depressing ending to the show. Several different scenarios ran across my mind but there was one that involved Daenerys possibly surviving (which nobody seems to think is going to happen now) and part of it is stolen from the book/movie Gone Girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the episode can be a build up of the others trying to convince Jon to confront Dany as they know their plan to remove Dany from power requires Jon in order to succeed. Eventually Jon is convinced and he enters the throne room with Dany determined to get her to give up the throne. It is there that Dany reveals to Jon that she is pregnant with his child. Even though everyone thought Dany couldn't have kids, Jon placed doubt on that in Season 7 questioning the witches validity. Jon, cursed with poor old dead Ned's honor now feels obligated to be with the mother of his child and raise his son. He is stuck. I don't know if the show should end with Daenerys dying during child birth and Jon as a single parent or Daenerys on the throne with a smirk knowing she's won the Game of Thrones and Jon sullen and depressed by her side. I'm leaning towards the latter. The joy of bringing a child into the world and the misery of the tyrannical wheel continuing to spin. Bittersweet indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

\*I don't think the 3ER will warg into Drogon. Since he doesn't even identify as Bran Stark anymore, I would think that means he has no rooting interest for anyone.

\*I don't think Arya kills Daenerys. The writers brought the prophecy back this season and had Melisandre emphasize blue eyes in reference to the Night King. That is the only reason I think it was brought up this season.

Have you all considered the possibility there is a big reveal around Bran that is the closest guarded secret of the show so far? It could literally be revealed with little to no extra footage.

It is right before your eyes. From Season 1.

I'll drop you 3 hints :

1. The Night King is sending a message.
2. Old Nan says Don't listen to crows. THEY LIE.
3. You know nothing, Jon Snow(s)

You look at spoilers and you think that's the story. And yet you miss to see who is pulling the strings along the way to the end. Everything about the story is explained with just understanding who Bran really is (and therefore questioning the way you looked at this story all along!)

While I think Dany had the streak of violence in her all along (like her father had the streak of madness)... and should have agency of the massacre to a good extent, how would you react if you realized that what sent her over the edge was the 3ER whispering in her ears to Burn them all? And what if this is exactly what the 3ER tried with the Mad King as well?

What if the 3ER (and CotF) did everything to lead to the destruction of Men and their power structures? And Night King / The Others were only built up in our minds as the villain to obfuscate our understanding of history? While they were trying to send the men a message all along about the truth of their creation (in their symbology)

The Night King wanted to destroy the 3ER to destroy history. Except the version of history Westeros was told (including the lore of the Long Night) was a lie all along, and the NK perhaps wanted to correct that by destroying the 3ER?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe im overthinking it but look...

&amp;nbsp;

I was thinking about Aegon Targaryen plot and what was the point of it. I mean Jon don't want the Throne and what we know from the leaks he won't get it. Also probably noone will even care about this in the last episode. So the entire plot was really just a forced event to push Danerys into the Mad Queen twist and for the ""lol he is fking his aunt"" memes?  
That would be so disappointing.

&amp;nbsp;

But there can be actually another reason. Especially because the Aegon plot started from Bran asking Sam to tell Jon about his parents. And it ends with Bran becoming a King.

&amp;nbsp;

So here is my theory, I won't go deep into how he became NK. There were a lot of theories, so maybe it's some time paradox shit or maybe Bran is both now, or even 3in1 if you consider NK, Bran and Three-Eyed Raven. My guess is that he is both or like he said to Jaimie in episode 8x02 ""Im something else"". 

&amp;nbsp;

**Theory:**  
Bran is the Night King and he can see the future to some degree.
It seems like he knows a lot of stuff, he was looking at Jaimie when he arrived like he was excepting him, he gave Arya the dagger, he was also waiting for Sam etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway he used his abilities to plot against them and figured that telling Jon about his parents will mess a lot. And this is extactly what happen. It pushed Danerys to the Mad Queen plot, because Jon ""didn't want her"". Tyrion and Varys were plotting against her etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Also the entire war vs NK was just an act and when everyone thought that he was useless and did nothing but some birds warging, He actually was controlling every move.

&amp;nbsp;

For example he could push Jorah to find Danerys and then make him die in her arms. He could give Sam this weird plot armor when everyone was saving him, because he needed him for the ""King voting"" in the finale. And Arya killing NK could also be his plan, like I said before he even gave her the dagger in season 7.  
He could also contact with the Night King to tell him something.

&amp;nbsp;

He can be also the reason of the other events that fked up KL. Like Cersei catching and exetuting Missandei wasn't just a forced plot but it was Bran acting behind the scenes. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's seems kinda weird that his plan would be so complex with his abilities but maybe he coudn't achive his goal in other way. Maybe Danerys is Azor Ahai and to stop the prophecy he needed Jon to kill her or maybe it works like Dr Strange and the 14 million different futures, or maybe for some reason he just needed to become a King.

&amp;nbsp;

That would also to some degree explain why Tyrion or Varys are acting so stupid. If they all are just a puppets in his hands then its at least somehow acceptable.  
Damn even the entire Mad Queen plot is better with this, since he did a lot of stuff that would push her and maybe even more from offscreen like messing up with her past.  
He even could play long-term game and actually also mess with Mad King like a lot of people said.
NK plot from episode 3 would be also saved since this was just an act.  

&amp;nbsp;


This also explains him becoming a King. If he is not the Night King then it doesn't make any sens that they would vote for him and he even accept it.

&amp;nbsp;

That would also explain why he is acting super weird in this season, even for the Three-eyed Raven. I mean sometimes when he is talking with Jaime/Jon or others it looks like he is mocking them. You can checks his scenes from this and previous season, his character really gives some weird vibes.

&amp;nbsp;


**btw. this is from the leaks:**  
""Sam mentions that they seen Drogon in some location but aren't sure. Bran just says, ""ill look for him"" -  This sounds a lot better if he is actually the Night King. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are no leaks about Bran being NK but they didn't need a lot of people to make his scenes so maybe they actually saved it from the leaks and this show won't be so fking bad. I mean it won't save everything like Jaimie's development or ""kind of forgot"" stuff (unless this was actual 200 IQ bait from D&amp;D and Danerys didn't forgot but Bran did something, doubt tho).


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary:**  
This theory is my last hope that would explain a lot of stuff and save some characters and plot. If this turn wrong and the entire Aegon plot was just a shit plot to force cheap twist and Bran was actually useless and out of nowhere he will accept the Throne then this show is dead.

&amp;nbsp;

btw. If im right about this then I have also a weird feeling about Sam in this season. Like he is also ""something else"" or at least he is Bran's main puppet. There was some weird scene in 8x01 when Sam walk up to Bran and asks him what he is doing out there. Bran answers ""Waiting, for an old friend"".

&lt;p&gt;That would also to some degree explain why Tyrion or Varys are acting so stupid. If they all are just a puppets in his hands then its at least somehow acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;
Damn even the entire Mad Queen plot is better with this, since he did a lot of stuff that would push her and maybe even more from offscreen like messing up with her past.&lt;br/&gt;
He even could play long-term game and actually also mess with Mad King like a lot of people said.
NK plot from episode 3 would be also saved since this was just an act.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also explains him becoming a King. If he is not the Night King then it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sens that they would vote for him and he even accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would also explain why he is acting super weird in this season, even for the Three-eyed Raven. I mean sometimes when he is talking with Jaime/Jon or others it looks like he is mocking them. You can checks his scenes from this and previous season, his character really gives some weird vibes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;btw. this is from the leaks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;Sam mentions that they seen Drogon in some location but aren&amp;#39;t sure. Bran just says, &amp;quot;ill look for him&amp;quot; -  This sounds a lot better if he is actually the Night King. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no leaks about Bran being NK but they didn&amp;#39;t need a lot of people to make his scenes so maybe they actually saved it from the leaks and this show won&amp;#39;t be so fking bad. I mean it won&amp;#39;t save everything like Jaimie&amp;#39;s development or &amp;quot;kind of forgot&amp;quot; stuff (unless this was actual 200 IQ bait from D&amp;amp;D and Danerys didn&amp;#39;t forgot but Bran did something, doubt tho).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This theory is my last hope that would explain a lot of stuff and save some characters and plot. If this turn wrong and the entire Aegon plot was just a shit plot to force cheap twist and Bran was actually useless and out of nowhere he will accept the Throne then this show is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw. If im right about this then I have also a weird feeling about Sam in this season. Like he is also &amp;quot;something else&amp;quot; or at least he is Bran&amp;#39;s main puppet. There was some weird scene in 8x01 when Sam walk up to Bran and asks him what he is doing out there. Bran answers &amp;quot;Waiting, for an old friend&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for grammar and other mistakes im not a native english speaker and its 6:00 AM in my country so my brain is not working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not always bad but it's never reached it's own high standards. I just want to start by giving a summary connecting the TV show characters to their current place in the latest book -  A Dance With Dragons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jon Snow - Season 5 finale and the 'for the watch' moment. Hardhome hasn't happened yet. The 'white walkers' have made their presence known but no 'Night King' equivalent or major attack yet.

Dany and Tyrion - Season 5 finale. Dany encounters old friends after the pit. In the books there is a slight, small story tangent with Tyrion that the show left out so the pit is the last moment the show and books are aligned.

Stannis - Before season 5 episode 9. He hasn't done the unthinkable yet and he hasn't fought Ramsay yet.

Arya - Roughly season 6 episode 5. Her story is roughly at the play/killing Trant.

Cersei - Season 5 episode 10 Shame!

All the Dorne - This is almost 100% completely rewritten from the books. It's awful and I haven't heard of anyone liking it. The last time Dorne was relevant and accurate is when Oberyn died at the end of season 4.

Tyrells - Roughly season 6 episode 6. Like Dorne the Tyrells have a few changes.

Sansa - Start of season 5. Still in the Vale and incognito. Thankfully it looks like the books will give Ramsay another victim.

Jamie - Season 6 episode 8. Taking over Riverrun and meeting Brienne.

Sam - End of season 6. Arriving at the Citadel.

Varys - Season 5 episode 3. When Mormont kidnaps Tyrion from him.

Bran - Season 6 episode 3. Roughly when he shouts to his dad in the past.

The Hound - End of season 4. He's left by Arya but there is no Brienne-Bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my theory and opinions on why the show declined.

1.) The books are setting up for a confrontation with Cersei first.

Having read the books it seems very much like the conflict between Dany and Cersei will take place before the book's equivalent of the Long Night. I think TV show flipped this narrative because they thought the people were more interested in the politics of the Iron Throne than the battle for survival. For me this negatively impacted the show because in seasons 6 &amp; 7 the show had to rush the Night King storyline in order to get to then end. What they should have done is have season 7 wrap up the battle for the Iron Throne and have season 8 be all about the Long Night. Instead they sort of sidelined the white walkers leaving us with little to no explanation behind their motives. I can't be the only one wondering why the Night King took killing Bran so personally can I?

2.) They cut out fake Aegon.

If you haven't read the books then you might not know this. Book Varys is running a secret plot to install a boy claiming to be Aegon Targaryen (the OG murdered one). Varys claimed he replaced him before his murder and plans to make him king. Not only did they cut a great storyline for Varys but they cut away a justification for Dany becoming mad. I think, only my opinion, that GRRM intends to use this 'fake Aegon' storyline to develop and show Dany's increasing mental instability. This is after all someone claiming her throne and its later revealed to be all a lie and she needs to ruthless put it down. It will also pay off better it's revealed Jon Snow, someone she loves, is the true heir. Dany will start fearing the Jon the way she feared the fake Aegon usurping her throne.

3.) No finished GRRM source to rely on for the final seasons.

If you look at the above characters and how much of their story has already been revealed in the books it corresponds quite well with which characters have thrived in the latter seasons of the show. 

 Jaime and Arya were brilliant in the show for me up until season 8 because 90% of their story is book based rather than D&amp;D based. 

How brilliant was Stannis? again almost 100% book based. 

Varys up until S5E3 was a great character but steadily declined before becoming pointless. He's just there to deliver exposition via spying.

Bran becomes an emotionless robot - why is he like that? the previous Three-Eyed Raven wasn't. 

Tyrion becomes much more emotional and sentimental in the last seasons. Why? he goes from being a cunning, intelligent maverick to the world's worst Vice-President. He goes from witty lines to lost-in-translation gags. 

I feel Jon was mostly done right. Season 7 was shaky and he spent far too long on Dragonstone. 

Dany hasn't gone crazy she's become evil. I can't think of a 'crazy' act Dany does before King's Landing episode despite several characters insisting she's nuts. 

Maybe I'm biased but I've never liked Sansa but what I disliked the most about her is how much gravitas and influence she is given. The way the Northmen are portrayed they'd never respect Sansa. Sansa attending the war meetings in season 8 is like Dominican Republic being involved in planning the D-Day invasions.

The Night King. At the moment the books have no equivalent character but I do have issues with the show. The Night King and indeed all wights and walkers are depicted as a determined force of nature with a singular goal of destroying humanity. It means everything to them and I liked Arya killing them and I like that Bran was their no.1 target (they should have explained it better and earlier than a day before the battle). 

The way he dies is stupid. It's really stupid but not as stupid as the Last Jedi version of it. There is a couple of reasons why.

1.) No one stops/sees/hears Arya. I've seen some people say the Hound threw her but I don't buy it mainly because that is awesome and only a moron wouldn't show that. 

2.) How Arya actually stabs him is impossible unless the Night King lets her do it. I have plenty of fond memories of picking up my little brother like he was nothing. If you are holding one arm out and grabbing someone by their throat/collar bone then they won't be able catch something with their right hand that they dropped with their left. As they edit the shot you can actually see the Night King's arms change position so that Arya's move looks possible.

3.) If Bran is so important to kill and you can only lose by dying why join the fight at all? They had won and he didn't do anything in the battle. All he had to do was sit down on a hill and watch the mayhem unfold. This is where the show deserves a lot of criticism. If it does mean that much for Bran to be killed personally then show us why. The Night King has the best and most interesting backstory of all the Game Of Thrones characters and he's given the generic bad guy treatment.

I haven't seen this theory elsewhere, but do let me know if I missed where someone already posted this theory.

To understand why the utter destruction of King's Landing isn't totally on Danerys, let's step back:
The Targaryans chained their mighty dragons after conquering Westeros. The magnificent, powerful beasts that the Targaryans unleashed were impossible to fully control.   After Season 8: Episode 5, how did dragon nature play out in the Battle for King's Landing?

Danerys was sometimes been able to control and direct her dragons, but sometimes they ignore her wishes and do their own thing, causing destruction (see: burned shepherd's child) or just leaving Dany alone in the middle of Dothraki country.  Dragons eat whatever they want, go where they want when they want.  They are not tame.  Dany loves her children, and doesn't want them to hurt anyone who isn't her enemies.  Recall that as they grew larger and more powerful, Dany felt compelled to chain them up for a while, a devastating choice for any parent.  But, when she needed their power again, Team Danerys set them loose.  Despite their unpredictable streak, Dany always believed that her ""children"" would do what she wants and help her conquests.  She forgot that Drogon is still wild, untamed, and thus dangerous.

In the assault on King's Landing, Drogon and Dany started off flying as a single force.  Drogon flew like a 1-beast airforce, clearly directed by Dany's tactical plans to take out the threats to Drogon and the city's military defenses.  As they approach the city, they even fly over running people, and look down, but there's no dragonfire.  Drogon was following his mother's directives like a good dragon.

As the city is about to surrender, we see a tear-streaked Dany clearly overlooking the city and focusing like a laser on the Red Keep.  The bells are ringing in surrender.  Then Drogon takes off, and seconds later the destruction begins.  We see Drogon everywhere, but we never see Dany again in Episode 5.  Everyone seems to think that Dany went mad and killed thousands of people in her rage.  And, lots of viewers are upset because firestorming the citizens seems to go against everything Danerys has ever stood for.  I agree- but I don't think she's mad or gave up her principles either.

Here's my take: GOT writers are playing on our assumptions (again) to set up a tragic twist.  It was Drogon who burned King's Landing, not Danerys.  Dragons are not an air force, and around the point when the city surrendered she lost control.  I think Dany was tear-streaked and sobbing and focused intently the last time we see her in Episode 5 - not because she was going mad, but in frustration at losing control so close to her final goal.  I think she landed to pause and regain control of Drogon, focusing hard to force Drogon to go for the Red Keep.  But ultimately she failed.  At first, they are making a beeline for the castle.  But then Drogon starts burning and smashing and goes on from there to wreck the entire city, taking his time for thorough and complete destruction.  Episode 5 is called ""The Bells""  Drogon apparently hates bells?

We also see Arya and smallfolk looking up at the dragon over and over.  Arya sees Drogon destroying the city.  We see Drogon and dragonfire over and over, but never Danerys.  What was the Breaker of Chains really doing?  Here's what is hidden from our view: Dany couldn't stop Drogon; she must have been hanging on for dear life the entire time, absolutely horrified and powerless to save people.

**Finale prediction:**
Drogon is the real threat.  Without a dragon, Danerys is just another warlord vying for the Iron Throne.  

Drogon has green eyes, and Arya is going to slay him, just like she killed the blue-eyed Night King. 

RR Martin's *Song of Ice and Fire* set up the clash of opposites: hot and cold, light and dark.  It's also about order vs chaos and about power and justice.  Long ago, the Children of the Forest were losing to humanity, so they unleashed the Night King and White Walkers to fight for them.  The Ice power harnessed the great forces of cold and darkness.  But, the Children lost control of their creation, and ended up victims too.  They had to help humans destroy the White Walkers or risk total annihilation.  Thousands and thousands died because of the uncontrollable power of Ice in the North.  In the end, Arya killed the Night King.

On the flip side, the Targaryans harnessed the great force of fire and light: dragons.  They used dragons to consolidate power and conquer Westeros.  But, like the Children of the Forest, the Targaryans could not entirely control dragon power that they unleashed.  Recognizing the danger, they chained the dragons and kept them penned up, so the great beasts dwindled away.  Without dragons, the Targaryans eventually lost their grip on power.  Now, Danerys has brought the dragons back, but unlike everyone around her she doesn't realize how dangerous they are until it is too late.  Thousands and thousands died because of the uncontrollable power of Fire at King's Landing.  Drogon is a monster and he has to go. In the end, I'm betting that Arya will slay Drogon in the finale. 

Fire &amp; Ice: 
Drogon = uncontrollable Fire/Light 
Night King = uncontrollable Ice/Darkness

From this viewpoint, the ruler that Westeros needs must be the embodiment of a just and cautious balance between Fire and Ice: Jon Snow - born of love between Targaryan and Stark.  But will Jon/Aegon take up the burden of the crown?  

To sum up: Drogon burned King's Landing, not Danerys.  Dragons are too wild and dangerous for human control, even a Targaryan who always seemed to be the chosen one, destined for the throne of greatness.  Drogon's rampage made Dany what she never wanted to become: Queen of the ashes.  Danerys was betrayed once more, this time by her own hubris and a very deadly wild dragon-child.

Tyrion was right about Danerys after all (though now at the end of the battle he surely thinks Varys called it).  It would be particularly high tragedy if Tyrion's bells of surrender made Drogon lose it.  

To everyone, Danerys Stormborn seems to be the new fire-mad queen they feared. Although Varys and all the rest are wrong, Westerosi survivors won't stop until she's dead now.  Unless she flees back to Mereen and her lover, someone will kill her pronto. I like the Varys poison theory, but that's beyond the scope of this theory. 

The song of Ice and Fire is all so beautifully tragic.  Can't wait to see how it plays out!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;what do we really know, and what are our emotions telling us we know that just ain&amp;#39;t so?  I haven&amp;#39;t seen this theory elsewhere, but do let me know if I missed where someone already posted this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why the utter destruction of King&amp;#39;s Landing isn&amp;#39;t totally on Danerys, let&amp;#39;s step back:
The Targaryans chained their mighty dragons after conquering Westeros. The magnificent, powerful beasts that the Targaryans unleashed were impossible to fully control.   After Season 8: Episode 5, how did dragon nature play out in the Battle for King&amp;#39;s Landing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danerys was sometimes been able to control and direct her dragons, but sometimes they ignore her wishes and do their own thing, causing destruction (see: burned shepherd&amp;#39;s child) or just leaving Dany alone in the middle of Dothraki country.  Dragons eat whatever they want, go where they want when they want.  They are not tame.  Dany loves her children, and doesn&amp;#39;t want them to hurt anyone who isn&amp;#39;t her enemies.  Recall that as they grew larger and more powerful, Dany felt compelled to chain them up for a while, a devastating choice for any parent.  But, when she needed their power again, Team Danerys set them loose.  Despite their unpredictable streak, Dany always believed that her &amp;quot;children&amp;quot; would do what she wants and help her conquests.  She forgot that Drogon is still wild, untamed, and thus dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the assault on King&amp;#39;s Landing, Drogon and Dany started off flying as a single force.  Drogon flew like a 1-beast airforce, clearly directed by Dany&amp;#39;s tactical plans to take out the threats to Drogon and the city&amp;#39;s military defenses.  As they approach the city, they even fly over running people, and look down, but there&amp;#39;s no dragonfire.  Drogon was following his mother&amp;#39;s directives like a good dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the city is about to surrender, we see a tear-streaked Dany clearly overlooking the city and focusing like a laser on the Red Keep.  The bells are ringing in surrender.

the first is a time jump. a short one, like they've done before, but this will be more noticeable. 

It's been a year, the war has ended and Daenerys had the throne and Jon is with her.

Behind Daenerys a baby cries and you see a closeup of  why Jon is by her side.

In Winterfell you have the other group, discontent and maybe plotting, Sansa with Arya and Bran, and you have Gendry backing them.

This puts into play the book prophecy for Daenerys when the witch tells her

 ‚ÄúWhen the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.‚Äù 

The other part would be Jon as the one killing Dany.

This goes with Melisandre's prophecy to Stannis which some people think is meant for Jon. 

 ‚ÄúThis war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family, and you will betray everything you once held dear, and it will all be worth it because you are the son of fire. You are the warrior of blood. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.‚Äù 

 I think in this scenario the only way this works is if he's the one that kills her, although it would have to be done to protect someone else. The only reason he's with her is because of their child and he wouldn't harm her unless it was absolutely necessary. 

That is to say, unless she marries Dany and they rule together. If they did that then a lot of Melisandre's prophecy is still correct. Then Sansa and Arya will have to defeat both Danaerys and Jon which could create a nice showdown of Arya killing Jon or vice versa.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a couple things i&amp;#39;d like to see for continuity&amp;#39;s sake. &lt;/p&gt;

Azor Ahai is reborn amidst salt and smoke, and pulls a burning sword from a fire (Lightbringer). ""Born"" shouldn't be taken literally, I think.

When she enters the House of Black and White in Bravos (a city of many islands, salt again), there are many braziers inside and the room is very smoky.

So back when the Children were creating the WW they were fighting with the First Men.  The north was fairly in the hands of the Children.  I would think that the location of Winterfell before it became Winterfell would be a stronghold for the Children.  It has a weirwood tree and a hot spring making it a valuable location.

This would also play with how there must always be a Stark in Winterfell.  Maybe when they created the WW there was some kind of tie between the location and the WW.  Because of this the Children got with the Starks and made sure they knew they needed to keep Winterfell protected once the Long Night was over.

3. It was confirmed last twist comes in very end.
4. HBO makes sure to review everything. it took 2 years.
5. They have prequels planned. Finale will have big impact on the success of these prequels/sequels/movies.
6. D&amp;D got next big job which Disney would not give them if HBO wasn't happy with them.
7. Bran was left on sideline whole season on purpose just to make end twist most shocking.

Bran connects all dots and we might even get 7th episode. They are F'ing with us. Don't let them. Look how much turbulence they caused. It's definitely on purpose. Plus we get so hooked on all this its free publicity.

BUT I‚Äôm convinced (also biased as fuck) that this is at least partially correct, so please read knowing this may be one giant spoiler...also, THIS IS LONG!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing, I think the ‚Äúleaks‚Äù that have taken over the internet were leaked PURPOSELY as a means of pushing the false narrative that Dany is full-blown mad, and to mask the true ending, substituting it with one that‚Äôs ridiculously predictable and likely nonsense. At 10 million an episode, GoT is the biggest boom in modern television--possibly even the biggest story contribution to the fantasy canon in history. It took two years to develop this season, and HBO offered 10 episodes to D&amp;D and they refused. Why? Maybe because the rushed and heavy-handed nature of the last episode was critical for the twist, maybe because keeping REAL leaks from spreading is a lot easier with 6 episodes than it is with 10. Leaking something that confirms the intended red herring is a brilliant way to pacify the audience and bury the real leaks. Golden rule of good storytelling, if 99% of viewers could have predicted the ending, then that ending is NOT going to happen. Period. I‚Äôm not trying to excuse the poor dialogue or the uneven pacing, but GRRM had a master plan, and I believe D&amp;D are going to deliver it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It all comes down to Bran.

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell was Bran doing during the Battle of Winterfell? He warged for most of the episode and we STILL haven't gotten a good explanation of what he did. Apparently, we‚Äôre supposed to shrug and say, Bran‚Äôs so weird, and leave it at that. Don‚Äôt fall for it. If you rewatch the scene where he wargs, he clearly goes into a flock of birds and then up to the NK. But watch the NK‚Äôs hand. For one, it‚Äôs not an angrily outstretched hand, it‚Äôs almost longing, welcoming. And two, the clip is blurred. Why? What is the purpose of blurring that clip? Are they trying to hide something? Flashforward to when the NK approaches Bran. He struts up, totally nonchalant, without his weapon drawn. The NK comes to a halt, taking his sweet time. Bran turns, glances into his the NK‚Äôs eyes, then at his sheathed sword, and back to the NK. It‚Äôs a very deliberate look--We‚Äôre meant to think this is Bran looking at Arya, but it‚Äôs too early (based on the wight‚Äôs hair blowing to signal Arya‚Äôs leap). After Bran eyes the sword, the NK tilts his head as if to ask, you want me to do what? And sure enough, he starts to take out his sword. When Arya leaps in, the NK turns and grabs her by the neck. He holds her for a second or two and does...well, nothing. She‚Äôs totally fine. Why? Because of Bran, of course. I contemplate her purpose later. Important to note, the NK also avoids a battle with Jon.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, let‚Äôs back peddle a bit to Season 7, Episode 2; Arya was on a mission and heading to King‚Äôs Landing, she already met up with Ed Sheeran and Hot Pie, yadayadayada--but she changes her mind and decides to return to Winterfell. On her way there, she comes across a wolf that she thinks is Nymeria (47:30). The wolf is all, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fucking rip out your throat, hoooman!!‚Äù But then Arya tells it she‚Äôs going home to Winterfell: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading North, girl. Back to Winterfell, I‚Äôm finally going home. Come with me.‚Äù The wolf, already calm, stares \*intently\* at Arya and then turns and leaves--and we‚Äôre supposed to believe it does this because it recognizes Arya. But like Arya says, ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt you \[Nymeria\].‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, Season 7, Episode 4; When she returns to Winterfell, Arya meets up with Bran (18:00). The first thing he says to her is ‚Äúyou came home‚Äù (hmm, pretty much her words). But he goes on, ‚ÄúI saw you at the crossroads. I thought you might go to King‚Äôs Landing.‚Äù Well, then, what did Arya encounter on her trip up North? Nothing other than an animal with a creepy-ass stare. Bran then explains to Sansa that Cersei is on Arya‚Äôs list. Tinfoil hat time, Bran warged into the wolf and had intended to kill Arya to prevent her from assassinating Cersei. When he realizes she has briefly given up on Cersei, and when he decides to use her during the BoW instead, he lets her live. Why did Bran want to stop Arya from killing Cersei? He needs Cersei to reign in order for the KL battle to take place. More on why this is important soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, back to a Season 8, Episode 1; (09:30); Jon returns to WF. He kisses Bran on the forehead and says, ‚ÄúLook at you. You‚Äôre a man.‚Äù Bran, of course, responds, ‚ÄúAlmost.‚Äù This is another moment where we‚Äôre supposed to roll our eyes and say, oh that Bran, what a weirdo! No, Bran is much more than a man, he‚Äôs the 3ER--which is something much more powerful and much more sinister than we‚Äôre led to believe. Seconds after Bran says this, Jon stands and the camera focuses on Dany, who‚Äôs looking pensive, and then back to Bran. The look Bran gives Dany is nothing less than a ‚ÄúI will cut you here and now‚Äù stare. It‚Äôs dark AF. Now, does he give her that look because he sees what she‚Äôll do in the future? Maybe...but if so, why plant the seeds? Why tell Jon and set it up to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Same episode ( \[This was inspired by[ u/DJlicouis](https://www.reddit.com/u/DJlicouis)\] (37:20): When Dany kisses Jon by the waterfall, Jon looks disturbed by Drogon‚Äôs \*intense\* stare. Hmm, who else stares like that? Shortly after, Bran asks Sam to tell Jon. Why would Bran do this? How does revealing the truth of Jon‚Äôs lineage (hours before the greatest battle for humanity) benefit anyone? Why?? It‚Äôs all to lay the framework for the scene at King‚Äôs Landing.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we‚Äôre at the infamous ‚ÄúThe Bells‚Äù; when Dany is perched on Drogon, listening to the bells ring, she‚Äôs obviously in turmoil, but she‚Äôs staring at the Red Keep--her eyes never leave it. She then makes a decision and takes off‚Äîheading to the keep, heading for her revenge, heading to kill Cersei (who Bran has saved to lure her into this exact moment). It‚Äôs only AFTER Drogon‚Äôs shadow is shown cascading over KL (the same image Bran has seen repeatedly) that Drogon switches directions and torches the civilians. We NEVER see Dany‚Äôs face during this raid. We also NEVER hear her say dracarys. Bran warged into Drogon to set his plan into motion. Bran torched the city. Dany is chaotic good. She‚Äôs a gray character, and that‚Äôs what makes her so intriguing. She loves brutal revenge--but the torching of a million innocent people with a bare minimal character arc‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs unlikely. Dany has very few options now. With all her trusted friends killed or in the process of abandoning her, how does she explain this? If she denies it, she‚Äôs crazy. If she says she blacked out, crazy. If she blames Drogon, shes still probably crazy and Drogon dies. Bran has spun a sticky web. More on why he‚Äôd do this in a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, let‚Äôs break the fourth wall and look at the behind the scenes clips for ‚ÄúThe Bells.‚Äù D&amp;D are great talkers. They have an impressive, dynamic vocabulary. They might have a shallow understanding of characters, but they have the ability to explain their reasonings. When they‚Äôre discussing Dany‚Äôs ‚Äúdescent into madness‚Äù they use vague and guarded language, throwing around the word ‚Äúmay‚Äù a lot: ‚ÄúShe \*may\* have to get things done in a way that is horrible for lots of people.‚Äù Dan (the one with the gray shirt) then says, ‚ÄúShe chose violence.‚Äù But doesn‚Äôt clarify. IF Dany did choose to kill Cersei, then that‚Äôs violence. This could be a guarded way of distinguishing between Dany‚Äôs chaotic good choice and Bran‚Äôs full-on destruction. They then go on to reflect back on how ‚Äúthere is something chilling in the way Dany has responded to the death of her enemies.‚Äù Keyword here, enemies. There‚Äôs a bit more talk on how we wouldn‚Äôt have seen this side of Dany had things been different. Again, what side? Depressed? Angry? Torching a goddamn city? It‚Äôs guarded language.

&amp;#x200B;

The best example of this is at 1:24:41 where David says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she decided ahead of time that she was...going to do what she did.‚Äù What \*she did?\* Why not say burn down King‚Äôs Landing? Why not be specific here? Maybe it‚Äôs to avoid spoilers, but when the Ds are reflecting on Ep. 3 The Long Night, they straight up say that they knew for the last 3 years that Arya would be the one who ‚Äúdelivered that final blow.‚Äù That‚Äôs specific‚Ä¶ but ‚Äúdo what she did‚Äù? David goes on: ‚ÄúAnd then she sees the Red Keep \[he mentions her family built it\], it‚Äôs in that moment, on the walls of King‚Äôs Landing, where she‚Äôs looking at that symbol of everything that‚Äôs taken from her, when she makes the decision to make this personal.‚Äù HOLD THE GODDAMN PHONE. Personal?? How is torching civilians personal? Cersei WANTED that! Or in the least, Cersei had used them as a morality shield. Dany knows Cersei could give a flying fuck about her citizens. D&amp;D can‚Äôt completely misguide the audience--they need to give little hints on what was really going on without giving it away. And I think this is a pretty big hint. Dany made it ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù by flying to the Red Keep. Bran made it a tragedy by blowing up the city. There‚Äôs more, and some of their language does suggest Dany is the cause of the burning--but these comments are from the POV of the citizens and the Dothraki.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so why, why does Bran do this? I don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs been some talk online about him being the Great Other, or the Great Other‚Äôs champion. The Great Other is the counter to the God of Light (think chaotic bad vs chaotic light). This is the best explanation I‚Äôve seen, and the one that fits best with these theories. How many times does Bran need to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Bran Stark,‚Äù that he‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù a man, before we believe him? Bran‚Äôs main enemy is Dany, the champion for the God of Light. Maybe Dany doesn‚Äôt burn, not because she‚Äôs Targaeran, but maybe Dany (and the legendary Targaerans) can‚Äôt burn because she‚Äôs chosen by the God of Light. The God of Light clearly loves fire...it‚Äôs a Song of Ice and Fire. Bran is Ice and Dany is Fire. Who Bran is and why he did it will be explained in the spin-offs--maybe we‚Äôll learn more about the Great Other.

&amp;#x200B;

Now some predictions for the last episode:

1. There‚Äôs a coup
2. Dany kills Arya (with Drogon--this is also why Bran keeps her alive and sends her the horse. It prompts number 3)
3. Epic battle between Jon and Dany (no backstabbing--but how did they film it and keep it a secret from the actors? What a coincidence...Jon has ALREADY FOUGHT A DRAGON AND THEY FILMED HIS CHOREOGRAPHY. And the outfit he‚Äôs wearing in the BoW is nearly identical to the one in ‚ÄúThe Bells‚Äù)
4. Jon takes the throne (or Tyrion with Sansa as the primary ruler)
5. The new ruler relies heavily on Bran‚Äôs ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù
6. Sansa realizes Bran is not who he says he is (for so many episodes he‚Äôs been saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Bran Stark‚Äù ffs!!) but she‚Äôs loyal to a fault and doesn‚Äôt say anything
7. We get a hint in the end that Bran is terribly bad and see he warged Drogon
8. We need to learn why (more about the Great Other) in the spin-offs

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe Cersei‚Äôs baby is important to Bran...rule 10 of fiction writing: If you don‚Äôt see ‚Äòem die, then it might be a lie.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm bound to be disappointed by all this, but here‚Äôs hoping!!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Bran is evil. He did everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heads up:&lt;/strong&gt; I discuss the leak but NOT the details of the predicted ending, just my theories (a few of which have already been proposed). BUT I‚Äôm convinced (also biased as fuck) that this is at least partially correct, so please read knowing this may be one giant spoiler...also, THIS IS LONG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, I think the ‚Äúleaks‚Äù that have taken over the internet were leaked PURPOSELY as a means of pushing the false narrative that Dany is full-blown mad, and to mask the true ending, substituting it with one that‚Äôs ridiculously predictable and likely nonsense. At 10 million an episode, GoT is the biggest boom in modern television--possibly even the biggest story contribution to the fantasy canon in history. It took two years to develop this season, and HBO offered 10 episodes to D&amp;amp;D and they refused. Why? Maybe because the rushed and heavy-handed nature of the last episode was critical for the twist, maybe because keeping REAL leaks from spreading is a lot easier with 6 episodes than it is with 10. Leaking something that confirms the intended red herring is a brilliant way to pacify the audience and bury the real leaks. Golden rule of good storytelling, if 99% of viewers could have predicted the ending, then that ending is NOT going to happen. Period. I‚Äôm not trying to excuse the poor dialogue or the uneven pacing, but GRRM had a master plan, and I believe D&amp;amp;D are going to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to Bran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell was Bran doing during the Battle of Winterfell? He warged for most of the episode and we STILL haven&amp;#39;t gotten a good explanation of what he did. Apparently, we‚Äôre supposed to shrug and say, Bran‚Äôs so weird, and leave it at that. Don‚Äôt fall for it. If you rewatch the scene where he wargs, he clearly goes into a flock of birds and then up to the NK. But watch the NK‚Äôs hand. For one, it‚Äôs not an angrily outstretched hand, it‚Äôs almost longing, welcoming. And two, the clip is blurred. Why? What is the purpose of blurring that clip? Are they trying to hide something? Flashforward to when the NK approaches Bran. He struts up, totally nonchalant, without his weapon drawn. The NK comes to a halt, taking his sweet time. Bran turns, glances into his the NK‚Äôs eyes, then at his sheathed sword, and back to the NK. It‚Äôs a very deliberate look--We‚Äôre meant to think this is Bran looking at Arya, but it‚Äôs too early (based on the wight‚Äôs hair blowing to signal Arya‚Äôs leap). After Bran eyes the sword, the NK tilts his head as if to ask, you want me to do what? And sure enough, he starts to take out his sword. When Arya leaps in, the NK turns and grabs her by the neck. He holds her for a second or two and does...well, nothing. She‚Äôs totally fine. Why? Because of Bran, of course. I contemplate her purpose later. Important to note, the NK also avoids a battle with Jon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let‚Äôs back peddle a bit to Season 7, Episode 2; Arya was on a mission and heading to King‚Äôs Landing, she already met up with Ed Sheeran and Hot Pie, yadayadayada--but she changes her mind and decides to return to Winterfell.

But like Arya says, ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt you [Nymeria].‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

PS - this is for fun, just thoughtful fun, I don't think this is actually going to come to be, but who knows!?

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

1) Remember when Bran was very subtly able to make Ned Stark aware of his presence in his earlier visions? EVEN THOUGH the 3-Eyed Raven had told him ""The past is already written. The ink is dry."" ... This could have been a hint that despite which limitations that should have been there Bran was even more powerful/had more potential than this. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Bran was mostly a non-factor/not seen in The Bells episode. None of Winterfell was, but it could matter... maybe...

&amp;#x200B;

3) Remember when Jon was about to tell Sansa about his true origin and that he is Aegon Targaryen... and Bran was sitting there. Which seemed a bit odd anyway, but Jon looked at Bran, Bran said ""It is your choice..."". Bran knew what was happening as if he had seen it already, either pathway.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Finally, the entire ""The Bells"" episode seemed a little out of wack to me. It could have been the chaos and fog of war, because it was just that, pure chaos that ensued. BUT, the whole time, subtle things seemed very ""dream-like"" to me. There was a scene with (to me) misplaced fog that was distracting me (could just have been ADD)... So many choices, impactful things happened that seemed like cause-delayed effect and seemed to be highlighted... 1) Arya/The Hound pushing past that Mom and her daughter, consequently they didn't get within the gates. 2) Jamie reached the dignhy decided to go back for Cersei. And what's worse decided to die with her in his arms.. (ew).  3) Arya decides not to go up to kill Cersei and potentially die. 4) Cersei to Surrender or not  5) Daenerys to burn the city or not... 

I don't have concrete evidence that this was anything more than a second to last episode closing loops (or opening new ones) but it just seemed odd to me that these choices were so in our face this time around, and all since Jon's choice to tell Sansa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Get to the point right?

Okay, so, the final episode begins and Bran wakes up in a gasp from a vision. The camera pans out from his face as he recovers in heavy breath. Pans out to his upper body... pans out to his full figure in his chair, pans out to this hand on the forearm of Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen, who also out of breath stares back at Bran in disbelief. Together they visited a possible future, one where Jon tells Sansa the truth. And they saw what will happen in that case. Bran learned to see the future and interact with it, he also was now powerful enough to take Jon with him, just as the Raven had done to Bran via touching the roots.

&amp;#x200B;

Or... less twisted sub-theory... Bran can now go back into the past and change that ""dried ink"" because he's the most powerful 3 eyed raven, and dimensions/time travel are so ""in"" right now.

He was writing letters about Jon's true identity when she arrived and their conversation goes as follows: 

*-: She won't eat.*

*-: We'll try again at supper.*

*-: I think they're watching me.*

*-: Who?*

*-: Her soldiers.*

*-: Of course they are, that's their job. What have I told you, Martha?*

*-: The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward.*

This conversation happened before he met Jon on the beach so he had the time to send those letters out. On the beach before trying to convince Jon to take the throne he told him ""she won't accept any food"" when asked about her which means up until then she hadn't been poisoned. That same day he was sentenced to death at night and executed but we know nothing about the fate of his spy, Martha. I believe she did carry out what he instructed her to do even after his death.

So now we know two things:

\- Part of his plan was informing people that Jon was the true heir to the throne

\- He plans on adding something to the queen's food

Straight up poisoning the queen would be a terrible idea. He knows how much Jon loves her and, though it would mean he will have to take the throne, it wouldn't end nicely for him after Jon figures out what he did. A better plan would be to push Dany into madness early, letting it loose on King's Landing and showing everyone a Mad Queen, which is exactly what happened. How?  [*Basilisk's blood*](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Basilisk%27s_blood)*.*

""*It will give cooked meat a savory smell, but if eaten it produces violent madness, in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk's blood. But to a man who loves his art, is not passion a form of madness?* "" \~ Oberyn Martell

This would justify the sudden descent into madness she took in such a short time. It would also give Varys a more meaningful arc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the episode we know that Varys has a spy in he kitchen. He was writing letters about Jon&amp;#39;s true identity when she arrived and their conversation goes as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: She won&amp;#39;t eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: We&amp;#39;ll try again at supper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: I think they&amp;#39;re watching me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: Who?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: Her soldiers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: Of course they are, that&amp;#39;s their job. What have I told you, Martha?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-: The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation happened before he met Jon on the beach so he had the time to send those letters out. On the beach before trying to convince Jon to take the throne he told him &amp;quot;she won&amp;#39;t accept any food&amp;quot; when asked about her which means up until then she hadn&amp;#39;t been poisoned. That same day he was sentenced to death at night and executed but we know nothing about the fate of his spy, Martha. I believe she did carry out what he instructed her to do even after his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we know two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Part of his plan was informing people that Jon was the true heir to the throne&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- He plans on adding something to the queen&amp;#39;s food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Straight up poisoning the queen would be a terrible idea. He knows how much Jon loves her and, though it would mean he will have to take the throne, it wouldn&amp;#39;t end nicely for him after Jon figures out what he did. A better plan would be to push Dany into madness early, letting it loose on King&amp;#39;s Landing and showing everyone a Mad Queen, which is exactly what happened. How?  &lt;a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Basilisk%27s_blood""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basilisk&amp;#39;s blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It will give cooked meat a savory smell, but if eaten it produces violent madness, in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk&amp;#39;s blood. But to a man who loves his art, is not passion a form of madness?&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot; ~ Oberyn Martell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would justify the sudden descent into madness she took in such a short time. It would also give Varys a more meaningful arc.&lt;/p&gt;

We all know what people are saying about that Aria miraculously lived through all those near death experience is an episode 5 and that miraculously a white horse appeared that is very strikingly similar to the horse that the leader of the golden company (Harry Strickland (( btw hands down one of the most boring names for a character on game of thrones ever, it sounds like he's a nephew of Bud Strickland of Strickland propane)))was riding, which we all saw totally get killed.

So in this scenario Arya Stark has become death. Now even though she physically died that doesn't necessarily mean the end for anybody in game of thrones, typically it's been reserved for the two most extreme sides of the spectrum, Jon Snow on the very top of the spectrum in the sense of being crazy important and obviously essential to the storyline, and then beric dondarrion who has only existed as mostly a minor major character at best and then obviously had a huge role to play, which brings us to Arya who somehow falls somewhere in the middle of the two. Arya has the strict winterfell convictions of family and responsibilities and pride and sense of just that the stark family has, but she also has the cold calculating real world cutthroat mentality that was bestowed upon her by the hound and her time in the House of black and white. And in the end it's ultimately the combination of Jons initial encouragement that she should be who she wants to be and berics sacrifice that allows her to be who she's meant to be. Ultimately Arya falls between the only known to people to be resurrected from the dead. 

Now this is where my theory starts to get a little bit out there.

I have always been completely baffled about how jaqen h'ghar was able to be captured when he was posing as a Lannister troop in season 2. And then he needed Arya to break him out of some ramshackle wooden cart? Also after that happened I'm pretty sure he left with a different face, but all of a sudden he bust out the same face in braavos? Isn't this like an assassin cult that prides themselves on having a bunch of faces? So the dude who was captured in King's landing as a Lannister troop, which typically get away with murder in King's landing( like literal murder) because the Lannisters are the real power of the kingdom and they can do what they want and therefore don't ever get in trouble, all the sudden is the guy who's supposed to teach her to be a master assassin? seems like a guy like that would only be there by design. Also remember when he told her he knew she was Arya Stark of winterfell and that Lords &amp; Ladies can't be faceless men. And then when she like totally broke all the rules but she was supposed to follow to become a faceless man but then got to become a faceless man anyways but she like turned it down. 

Now this brings me to varys.

We know that in the most recent episode varys  was obviously trying to poison Danny, we also know that Jon arryn and Robert baratheon died of poison. We also know that varys helped Robert track down the remaining targaryens after he won the crown, also that he was paying jorah mormont to spy on Dany(which is probably how jorah knew that the wine in pentos was poisoned). He was always a loyal Targaryen supporter, his problem was he didn't know which Targaryen to support. And I believe it all goes back to what he saw in the flames and what he heard in the flames when a sorcerer made him a eunuch. I think he's known what his destiny was the entire time, and that's why his allegiances have seemingly shifted so easily throughout the show.

Because of this I also believe there are very Stark ( pun intended) similarities between Ned and varys for these very reasons I've listed above. Both were executed for betraying the kingdom for what they believed was right and both of their last acts before execution where to send out letters informing the kingdom of the true heir. 

Now what brings me back to all of this is that I believe the only reason jaqen h'ghar was in King's landing was because varys hired them. I believe that after varus visited Ned Stark in the dungeons and pleaded with him to just take the black and beg for mercy, and Ned refused , that varys hired the faceless men. Varys knew the song of ice and fire before anyone. He isn't a follower of rhollor tho, so what he sees in the flames is only a glimpse of what the sorcerer, who used his blood, saw in the flames. So his vision want as clear as someone like melisandres, kinda like how the hound had to go stomp around north of the wall before his vision fully became clear. He just knows it takes a Stark and a targaryen and he's trying to make it work. He arranged everything. Every single major trigger that started the GOT plot was influenced by varys. 

I me think about it, how else could the wandering Crow have recruited jaqen h'ghar, and somehow knew that Arya would be there at neds execution? especially considering that Ned has been in the dungeons for some time and had no possible way of knowing or getting a message to the wandering Crow to go snatch his daughter from his public beheading. Especially considering at that point Sansa and even Cersei believed that joffrey was going to give ned Mercy. but you know who would have known the joffrey wasn't going to give Mercy?

First, the info that I'm sure everyone knows:

So, Arya seems to have been guided by the lord of light to kill the night king. Not sure when this started, but the first I know of it is when she met Melisandre. She told her the same thing about closing the eyes. She also took away Gendry, which, as we saw recently, Arya was attracted to. He was a potential threat to the path she was to take. From there, she met Jaqen H'ghar and saved him from that burning wagon. The lord of light is also known as the Fire God, and the Red God, who Jaqen mentions. Jaqen is, of course, the reason that Arya is as strong as she is today. Fast forward to the battle with the night king. Arya is saved by Beric Dondarrion, a man who has been resurrected repeatedly by the lord of light. Then Melisandre reminds her of the fact that she is going to kill the night king. 

Now my new (I hope) theory:

There has been a third major player in getting Arya to where she is. A fine fellow by the name of Sandor Clegane. The hound has been there for a lot of Arya's story. In the end, he convinced her to leave the crumbling castle, which probably saved her life. He also basically brought her to the point where she left for Braavos. He was also one of the three major people that got her to the night king, who, had she not killed, the next episode would have been quite a bit different. So, how does Sandor Clegane tie in to the lord of light? The first thing that anyone would notice about him: his scarred face. Which was caused by fire(Again, Fire God) which the mountain forced him into. This brings him to the castle to fight the mountain, and therefore saving Arya. In addition, he tried to stray from the path of revenge. Then the village he was in was slaughtered and he went seeking the men who did it. This led him to where the brotherhood without banners, and Beric Dondarrion were about to hang their own men for the slaughtering they had performed. 

Oh, and let's not forget Arya standing up with a bright light behind her, and finding a horse that somehow survived in ground zero of the WMD that was Drogon. (Also. It had blood on it, so something died right next to it) That might have a little bit of relevance as well.

So, thoughts? Out of my mind?

So ""the green eyes"" that Arya will shut might just as easily be his.

Arya still doesn't know that, all she knows is that she's been brought back to life three times  (I think it was pretty obvious, and haven't we all established already that divine intervention resurrection is legitimate part of the plot?)  literally the only one left alive in an absolute holocaust of innocents, with a magically appearing blood-smeared white horse to take her the Grand Purpose that she's there to fulfill.  She's probably guessing it's Daenerys she's supposed to kill, but I'm guessing the events will turn another way. I can totally see her, tragically, taking Greyworm's face in an assassination attempt.

There may be a part for Bronn to play in this, and there may a surviving scorpion left operational somewhere, perhaps supplied by Sansa? If I were her, I would have started manufacturing those scorpions en masse the minute Daenerys left Winterfell. Or it may be on an Iron ship captured by Yara? It's not impossible that one somehow shows up for the finals.

Or, of course, it may be up to Jon to slay the dragon. Though he will never, ever, ever in a million years harm Daenerys, don't fool yourselves, do you not know Jon - Jon the merciful, the honorable, the pure-hearted, noble Jon? But he will be tested, as Daenerys will require him to bend the knee, in front of all the troops, and threaten to obliterate the Northmen army with dragon fire if he doesn't.

(The dragon, btw - Drogon's transformation into a full blown nightmare-come-real nazgul-like terror, shrieking dark shadow under the led overcast sky, I think it's one of the great GoT moments, where previously unimaginable evil suddenly becomes real, tangible and inescapable. The whole episode was great tv, but I'm not surprised that some of the audience, who complained that e03 was too dark, think differently. Burning of King's Landing was like GoT version of the LotR's ""here at the end of all things"", except no eagles come.)

Jon's purpose is not to fight Daenerys, but to save her, with his love and mercy, perhaps similarly to what Jamie did for Cersei in their final moments. I don't have a clue as to how this will play out, but it's very much in their characters and in the character of the story. (Also, it would be really cool if Bran could somehow warg into the dragon, as others have suggested).

Oh, and don't you just like how in these final resolutions all characters get to say farewell on a high note, how by dying the most heroic deaths they not only fulfill their higher purpose but also play their part to the max, so to speak? Even the villains, actually especially the villains, who to the last moment heroically stay on top of their villain game thus pushing the heroes to even greater heroic heights. I think it's awesome.

I‚Äôve included the leaks, but haven‚Äôt specified what are leaks and what are my own theories so people not wanting to know exactly what the leaks are can still read.

I still have hope that we‚Äôll see an amazing ending. After all, this ending was created back when the writing was still incredible. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm hoping it will all go down. 

Tyrion will find the boat unused and see the debris blocking the exit and know his brother and sister didn‚Äôt make it.

Arya will ride straight to Jon. She realizes that she‚Äôs defenseless against Daenerys‚Äôs power and Jon may be the only one capable of killing her. She‚Äôll beg that he does it for the safety of his family. He‚Äôll respond that she‚Äôs family too, but Arya will disagree saying something like, family isn‚Äôt just about blood, but the bond that makes it so you put their safety and well-being above everything else and clearly Daenerys didn‚Äôt do that for Jon when she torched King‚Äôs Landing. He‚Äôll reluctantly agree.

After speaking with The Hound about not having her life be about vengeance and the talk with Jon about family she realizes what she wants more than anything is family. She finds Gendry and accepts his proposal.

Greyworm, having fulfilled his promise to Daenerys to get her on the throne, will leave for Naath to return Missandei‚Äôs body to her home.

Representatives from around the seven kingdoms will come to meet their new queen. She‚Äôll give a speech that justifies why she must use fear to rule. Something along the lines of she must do evil things when the enemy is evil. Then she‚Äôll go on to announce that Tyrion has betrayed her by releasing Jamie. He‚Äôll beg for a fair trial and Daenerys will agree not wanting to be seen as an unjust ruler.

Jon will kill Daenerys in the throne room and Drogon will appear to go after Jon, but instead take Daenerys‚Äôs body and fly away.

Jon goes to confess his crimes to Daenerys‚Äôs remaining council and it‚Äôs decided he‚Äôll take the black. 

A small counsel is formed to decide who should rule the iron throne. Bran is chosen because his omnipotence and unemotional behavior make him a logical choice.

Tyrion‚Äôs trial will start and it will be a surprisingly fair trial to demonstrate how much things have changed. He‚Äôll admit that fighting his own family has made him stupid, he couldn‚Äôt stop loving them and so subconsciously he couldn‚Äôt be cunning to their detriment, but now that they‚Äôre all dead his stupidity is no longer a threat. He‚Äôll be given a minor punishment.

Jon arrives at Moles Town and has a warm welcome from Ghost and Tormund. Jon asks why he hasn‚Äôt gone further north and Tormund explains the winter is still too brutal. Jon looks confused and the scene switches to a close up of Bran. 

The council is discussing the future and how they got to where they are. Someone asks Bran why he never warned them about any of the terrible events to come and he simply explains that things had to happen this way for everything to work out. This satisfies everyone except Sansa who has a subtly concerned look on her face. 

Everyone is shown returning to their castles. Arya and Gendry to Storms End, Bronn to the Reach, Yara to the Iron Islands, Sansa to Winterfell, etc. Sansa will then begin reading books claiming she needs to keep a sharp mind as the new Warden of the North. She finds what she‚Äôs really looking for, the dark history of the Three Eyed Raven. A history of him manipulating man into their own destruction as vengeance for the Children of the Forest. 

Credits roll, everyone‚Äôs pissed it‚Äôs ending on a cliffhanger, then, ‚ÄúNext week on Game of Thrones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a surprise 7th episode and the two hour documentary the following week was just a cover.

The finale will begin in Storm‚Äôs End. A fitting place for an ending. Arya and Gendry‚Äôs wedding will begin and everyone will be there. Sansa is cold and distant throughout the wedding. Everyone assumes she‚Äôs bitter her little sister is getting married to a nice man before her, but in reality she‚Äôs afraid for what she‚Äôs about to do knowing it could mean her life as well as the lives of every one else. Her hesitance is key though as it keeps the future uncertain enough that the Three Eyed Raven can‚Äôt see it. But ultimately she stands up and announces the truth about The Three Eyed Raven. Bran will say something like I underestimated you. Brienne will go to stab him to no avail so they‚Äôll take him prisoner instead.

Children of the Forest will begin to surround the castle. It will become apparent that this will be no ordinary battle as the Children‚Äôs magic makes people begin to hallucinate. This is where the remaining Stark children look at their crypt statues from the teasers. The Children are able to rescue The Three Eyed Raven and retreat north.

Tyrion will come up with a clever plan now that he has an enemy he feels is fully deserving of his cunningness. Of course he can‚Äôt say it aloud so The Three Eyed Raven can hear and asks everyone to just trust him. Everyone will reluctantly agree. They‚Äôll head north to find an army of Children of the Forest and beasts using the wall as a fortress. Among the beasts is Nymeria and her pack along with Ghost under the Children‚Äôs control. Tyrion‚Äôs plan will work out perfectly. They‚Äôll get Arya in to position with the dagger assuming that since it killed the Night King it would kill the Three Eyed Raven, but they‚Äôre wrong. Nymeria and her pack sneaks up behind Arya but she‚Äôs quick enough to drive the dagger through her head and proceeds to fight the rest of her pack. Things look very grim.

We‚Äôll then see Drogon carrying Daenerys flying into Asshai. He places her in front of the Red Priestess Kinvara. Her and the Lord of Light bring her back. She awakens and says she saw Khal Drogo and Rhaego and wanted to stay but knew she had to return. Kinvara confirms she has very important business to take care of. She‚Äôll explain the prophecy and people‚Äôs roles surrounding it. 

Varys was a servant for The Three Eyed Raven and the Old Gods. His mission was always to kill Daenerys, Azor Ahai, and protect the realm of the Children of the Forest. The fire the Red Priestesses spoke of warned him if he ever tried to kill Azor Ahai she would kill him. He knew their magic would make it come to be and so he‚Äôd have to be clever about how he did it. Him and the Three Eyed Raven plotted to create a narrative of madness so her own people would kill her.

It will be revealed that the Three Eyed Raven has been whispering in her ear for years and was finally able to make her snap during the battle of King‚Äôs Landing just as he had done with her father before her in a previous attempt to destroy Azor Ahai.

Littlefinger was a servant for the Lord of Light. His mission was to try to destroy The Three Eyed Raven. He tried to have Bran killed from the very beginning with the cut throat. He tried again by getting Ned killed hoping the Lannister‚Äôs would kill or keep all of his children prisoner. He had to keep his actions shady so The Three Eyed Raven wouldn‚Äôt suspect him of anything but wanting the throne for himself. In the end realizing the Three Eyed Raven was on to him he figured the best thing he could do was give Sansa one last lesson, don‚Äôt trust anyone, and hope she‚Äôd put two and two together about Bran.

Daenerys will fly to Storm‚Äôs End. The Children will flee before her and her dragon. She‚Äôll find Jon. He‚Äôll think he‚Äôs hallucinating or dead when he sees her. She‚Äôll explain things to him including how as Azor Ahai she needs to perform some blood magic by sacrificing Jon to join his soul to Drogon so The Three Eyed Raven can‚Äôt warg into him and ruin their plan. She‚Äôll say he‚Äôs the only one that can do it because he has the blood of a dragon. He‚Äôll say something like it‚Äôd be an honor to die for the woman I love. They kiss and Daenerys climbs on Drogon. Before she can give the command to kill Jon, Drogon‚Äôs eyes turn white. They fly away and begin annihilating people with fire. A swarm of Children of the Forest accompanied by Ghost comes and attacks Jon. Eventually Daenerys is able to make Drogon snap out of it just long enough to Dracarys Jon.

Drogon starts glowing red and bursts into flames. Daenerys in her final unburnt moment proceeds to burn down all of the Weirwood trees.

With that the Children of the Forest and The Three Eyed Raven are destroyed, but with them all of the magic in the world. Everyone stops hallucinating, Kinvara dies in a similar fashion to Melisandre, and the magic that brought Drogon into this world is gone so he crumbles into ash and Daenerys falls to her death.

Gendry and Arya take the throne so an honorable man and a just woman still end up on the throne. The bittersweet part being they‚Äôre left in a world void of all of the magic and wonder that drew us to their story in the first place. It will end with Arya and Gendry singing A Song of Ice and Fire to their three little boys as we‚Äôre shown scenes of the survivor‚Äôs lives. 

I spent way too long writing this out last night for it to likely be shattered in a few days, but oh well I had fun connecting the dots in a way that made more sense to me than the way it appears it will end. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised by something way better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a more detailed version of my previous theory. I‚Äôve included the leaks, but haven‚Äôt specified what are leaks and what are my own theories so people not wanting to know exactly what the leaks are can still read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have hope that we‚Äôll see an amazing ending. After all, this ending was created back when the writing was still incredible. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm hoping it will all go down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrion will find the boat unused and see the debris blocking the exit and know his brother and sister didn‚Äôt make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya will ride straight to Jon. She realizes that she‚Äôs defenseless against Daenerys‚Äôs power and Jon may be the only one capable of killing her. She‚Äôll beg that he does it for the safety of his family. He‚Äôll respond that she‚Äôs family too, but Arya will disagree saying something like, family isn‚Äôt just about blood, but the bond that makes it so you put their safety and well-being above everything else and clearly Daenerys didn‚Äôt do that for Jon when she torched King‚Äôs Landing. He‚Äôll reluctantly agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with The Hound about not having her life be about vengeance and the talk with Jon about family she realizes what she wants more than anything is family. She finds Gendry and accepts his proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greyworm, having fulfilled his promise to Daenerys to get her on the throne, will leave for Naath to return Missandei‚Äôs body to her home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from around the seven kingdoms will come to meet their new queen. She‚Äôll give a speech that justifies why she must use fear to rule. Something along the lines of she must do evil things when the enemy is evil. Then she‚Äôll go on to announce that Tyrion has betrayed her by releasing Jamie. He‚Äôll beg for a fair trial and Daenerys will agree not wanting to be seen as an unjust ruler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon will kill Daenerys in the throne room and Drogon will appear to go after Jon, but instead take Daenerys‚Äôs body and fly away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon goes to confess his crimes to Daenerys‚Äôs remaining council and it‚Äôs decided he‚Äôll take the black. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small counsel is formed to decide who should rule the iron throne. Bran is chosen because his omnipotence and unemotional behavior make him a logical choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrion‚Äôs trial will start and it will be a surprisingly fair trial to demonstrate how much things have changed. He‚Äôll admit that fighting his own family has made him stupid, he couldn‚Äôt stop loving them and so subconsciously he couldn‚Äôt be cunning to their detriment, but now that they‚Äôre all dead his stupidity is no longer a threat. He‚Äôll be given a minor punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon arrives at Moles Town and has a warm welcome from Ghost and Tormund. Jon asks why he hasn‚Äôt gone further north and Tormund explains the winter is still too brutal. Jon looks confused and the scene switches to a close up of Bran. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The council is discussing the future and how they got to where they are. Someone asks Bran why he never warned them about any of the terrible events to come and he simply explains that things had to happen this way for everything to work out. This satisfies everyone except Sansa who has a subtly concerned look on her face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is shown returning to their castles. Arya and Gendry to Storms End, Bronn to the Reach, Yara to the Iron Islands, Sansa to Winterfell, etc. Sansa will then begin reading books claiming she needs to keep a sharp mind as the new Warden of the North. She finds what she‚Äôs really looking for, the dark history of the Three Eyed Raven. A history of him manipulating man into their own destruction as vengeance for the Children of the Forest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credits roll, everyone‚Äôs pissed it‚Äôs ending on a cliffhanger, then, ‚ÄúNext week on Game of Thrones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a surprise 7th episode and the two hour documentary the following week was just a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale will begin in Storm‚Äôs End. A fitting place for an ending. Arya and Gendry‚Äôs wedding will begin and everyone will be there. Sansa is cold and distant throughout the wedding. Everyone assumes she‚Äôs bitter her little sister is getting married to a nice man before her, but in reality she‚Äôs afraid for what she‚Äôs about to do knowing it could mean her life as well as the lives of every one else. Her hesitance is key though as it keeps the future uncertain enough that the Three Eyed Raven can‚Äôt see it. But ultimately she stands up and announces the truth about The Three Eyed Raven. Bran will say something like I underestimated you. Brienne will go to stab him to no avail so they‚Äôll take him prisoner instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of the Forest will begin to surround the castle. It will become apparent that this will be no ordinary battle as the Children‚Äôs magic makes people begin to hallucinate. This is where the remaining Stark children look at their crypt statues from the teasers. The Children are able to rescue The Three Eyed Raven and retreat north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrion will come up with a clever plan now that he has an enemy he feels is fully deserving of his cunningness. Of course he can‚Äôt say it aloud so The Three Eyed Raven can hear and asks everyone to just trust him. Everyone will reluctantly agree. They‚Äôll head north to find an army of Children of the Forest and beasts using the wall as a fortress. Among the beasts is Nymeria and her pack along with Ghost under the Children‚Äôs control. Tyrion‚Äôs plan will work out perfectly. They‚Äôll get Arya in to position with the dagger assuming that since it killed the Night King it would kill the Three Eyed Raven, but they‚Äôre wrong. Nymeria and her pack sneaks up behind Arya but she‚Äôs quick enough to drive the dagger through her head and proceeds to fight the rest of her pack. Things look very grim.&lt;/p&gt;

With that in mind, I've been trying to work out how he can die and the only way that can happen at this point (all the scorpion crossbows are destroyed) which is plausible, is for Bran to warg into Drogon and then fly him into a volcano, mountain or something that will destroy him. On top of this, he could do it whilst Dany is riding Drogon!!!

Basically...

**Bran + Drogon = Dead Dany**

I realise there is one glaring plot hole with this theory, which is Bran doesn't intervene. However, he gave Arya the knife that killed the night king (is that intervening?) and so this could be his last act before he dies, because warging into a dragon is too much for him to recover from.

In GoT, Missandei's execution at the hands of Ser Robert Strong (Gregor) is one of the final nails in the coffin for Daenerys' sanity and a motivator for Grey Worm and the Unsullied to commit war crimes. It seems quite likely at this point that GRRM's plan for the books also involves Daenerys burning King's Landing, although the exact circumstances will almost certainly be different and better foreshadowed.

One key difference will have to be Missandei's role in driving Daenerys to ""madness,"" because what happened to her in S8E4 would be complete nonsense in the books. To recap, Euron teleported in with his railgun galleys, casually gunned down a dragon, wrecked her fleet, *and completely ignored all of the other people who were now at his mercy to abduct only Missandei.* Then she was somehow identified as extremely important to Daenerys, trotted out to an inexplicable parley that should have ended in Dany and Drogon's grisly scorpion-inflicted demise, and then executed *for zero reason other than the evulz despite her clear value as a hostage and human shield.* This resulted in Dany losing her only friend (she has several Dothraki handmaidens in the books who fill a similar role) and enraged her romantic interest Grey Worm (who is a strictly professional soldier with no romantic attachments in the books for obvious reasons, not to mention a pretty minor character). 

So let's assume **1) Missandei will die in circumstances that contribute to Dany flipping out, 2) it will happen in circumstances that bear almost no resemblance to what happened on the show, and 3) these circumstances were not conducive to the TV show because they related to elements or plots that D&amp;D chose to cut.**

I think there is one very strong possibility that satisfies all of these conditions: **Missandei is a Faceless Man, sent to spy on Dany and possibly assassinate her at the time of their choosing. This will be revealed near the end of the books and lead to Daenerys developing serious and well-justified paranoia, undermining her mental stability.**

------------------------------------------------

**For this to be true, Missandei has to be a Faceless Man. I think there are many reasons to believe this is the case.**

**1) Book Missandei's abilities seem inexplicable given her age.** Like on the show, Book Missandei speaks many languages, including the Common Tongue, High Valyrian, bastard Valyrian, and the dead language of Ghiscari, along with others (a total of twelve according to [this thread](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/82748-missandei-is-a-faceless-manwoman-perhaps-izembaro/)). Unlike on the show, *Book Missandei is 10 years old at most when she meets Daenerys.* Now, speaking twelve languages at 10 is very impressive by itself, but not necessarily evidence of something sinister, especially since ASOIAF contains many oddly gifted child characters. However, the scope of her abilities goes well beyond language. She can hear things others don't:

&gt;At her command, Missandei stripped off her clothes and climbed in after her. ‚ÄúThis one heard the Astapori scratching at the walls last night,‚Äù the little scribe said as she was washing Dany‚Äôs back.
Irri and Jhiqui exchanged a look. ‚ÄúNo one was scratching,‚Äù said Jhiqui. ‚ÄúScratching ‚Ä¶ how could they scratch?‚Äù
‚ÄúWith their hands,‚Äù said Missandei. ‚ÄúThe bricks are old and crumbling. They are trying to claw their way into the city.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis would take them many years,‚Äù said Irri. ‚ÄúThe walls are very thick. This is known.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is known,‚Äù agreed Jhiqui.
‚ÄúI dream of them as well.‚Äù Dany took Missandei‚Äôs hand.
‚ÄúThe camp is a good half-mile from the city, my sweetling. No one was scratching at the walls.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour Grace knows best,‚Äù said Missandei.

She can sneak up on a Kingsguard with decades of experience:

&gt;‚ÄúShe might be flying home,‚Äù he told himself, aloud. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù murmured a soft voice behind him. ‚ÄúShe would not do that, ser. She would not go home without us.‚Äù
Ser Barristan turned. ‚ÄúMissandei. Child. How long have you been standing there?‚Äù

But most of all, when Quentyn is dying of his dragon inflicted burns, she eases his passing when no one else can:

&gt;Missandei sat at the bedside. She had been with the prince night and day, tending to such needs as he could express, giving him water and milk of the poppy when he was strong enough to drink, listening to the few tortured words he gasped out from time to time, reading to him when he fell quiet, sleeping in her chair beside him. Ser Barristan had asked some of the queen‚Äôs cupbearers to help, but the sight of the burned man was too much for even the boldest of them. And the Blue Graces had never come, though he‚Äôd sent for them four times. Perhaps the last of them had been carried off by the pale mare by now.
The tiny Naathi scribe looked up at his approach.
‚ÄúHonored ser. The prince is beyond pain now. His Dornish gods have taken him home. See? He smiles.‚Äù
[Barristan thinks]How can you tell? He has no lips.

This particular skill doesn't overlap with being a scribe at all, *but is one of the core skills of the Faceless Men.* Taken together, it would be extremely strange for one ten year old girl to have all these abilities. A Faceless Man, however, could easily have all of them as they could be much more than ten years old, as demonstrated by the waif.

&gt;The waif nodded. Arya nodded back, and in her best Braavosi said, ‚ÄúHow many years have you?‚Äù
The waif showed ten fingers. Then ten again, and yet again. Then six. Her face remained as smooth as still water. She can‚Äôt be six-and-thirty, Arya thought. She‚Äôs a little girl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying,‚Äù she said. The waif shook her head and showed her once again: ten and ten and ten and six. She said the words for six-and-thirty, and made Arya say them too.

**2) Missandei's backstory would be ideal cover for a Faceless Man.** Many of the wacky ""X character has been replaced by a FM"" theories suffer from a problem: in order to convincingly pull off a disguise as that character the FM would have to know enough details about that person's life to fool people who have strong connections with them. Supposedly the faces a FM uses magically provide some of that person's memories, but we have little reason to believe that information is comprehensive. However, by virtue of being ""from Naath"" (supposedly), far far away from almost every other character, *there is no one who could possibly verify whether Missandei's story about her origins is truthful.* The main person who might be able to is her former master Kraznys, and he was dead within days of Missandei meeting Daenerys. There is also the possibility that Book Missandei's three supposed Unsullied brothers would know, but it's quite unlikely she has those brothers to begin with. It takes nine years to train an Unsullied, yet Missandei, a ten year old, supposedly remembers playing with her brothers on Naath before they were captured. 

&gt;‚ÄúHe taught me how to climb a tree when we were little. He could catch fish with his hands. Once I found him sleeping in our garden with a hundred butterflies crawling over him. He looked so beautiful that morning, this one ‚Ä¶ I mean, I loved him.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs he loved you.‚Äù Dany stroked the girl‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúSay the word, my sweet, and I will send you from this awful place. I will find a ship somehow and send you home. To Naath.‚Äù
‚ÄúI would sooner stay with you. On Naath I‚Äôd be afraid. What if the slavers came again? I feel safe when I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù

*This is clearly impossible* and either proof that GRRM made a rare logical inconsistency, or a sign that she is not who she claims to be.

**3) Missandei has a couple odd linguistic tells.** First of which is her frequent usage of ""this one"" to refer to herself. This is common among other slaves (Grey Worm uses it), but Missandei is far more linguistically adept than those slaves. Surely she should have been able to pick up the word ""I"" by now? Perhaps this is evidence of a very deep level of depersonalization on her part, exceeding that which an ordinary slave might feel, but typical of someone who has been trained to be ""no one?""

Secondly, while the show throws Valar Morghulis around like it's a super common Essosi greeting, it's actually quite rare in the books, appearing only [twenty-five](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-is-Valar-Morghulis-mentioned) times. Nineteen of those times it is used by Arya, and four of the remaining times it's used by Jaqen or people in the House of Black and White. The only two people without a clear FM connection to use the phrase are Oberyn (who is a master poisoner, I wouldn't be surprised if he was at least loosely associated with the Faceless Men) and Missandei.

&gt;‚ÄúI can give you freedom, but not safety,‚Äù Dany warned. ‚ÄúI have a world to cross and wars to fight. You may go hungry. You may grow sick. You may be killed.‚Äù
‚ÄúValar morghulis,‚Äù said Missandei, in High Valyrian.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**So if Missandei is a Faceless Man, why is she infiltrating Dany's court in the first place? There are several possible reasons.**

**1) The Faceless Men love money.** Even if they have no agenda of their own, Daenerys is one of the most dangerous people in the world, and has many enemies who would pay a lot to see her die. Faceless Men assassinations require careful planning and can take a lot of time to set up. As show Jaqen puts it:

&gt;""A minute. An hour. A month. Death is certain. The time is not.""

It would therefore make good business sense for the FM to have an agent ready and waiting to fulfill that extremely lucrative contract if it ever comes.

**2) The Faceless Men hate slavery.** The cult arose amid the slaves of the Valyrian Empire to ""liberate"" them from suffering, and currently reside in a city that prides itself on being one of the few places in Essos that has no slaves and does no business with slavers. Consequently, while they have excellent reasons to kill her, they also have great reasons to not do so immediately, and allow her wars of liberation to continue. But what Daenerys finishes her Eastern campaigns, or worse, becomes a cruel slaver herself? Then it is likely the Faceless Men would quickly seek to take her out.

**3) The Faceless Men hate dragons.** Because of their roots in the Valyrian empire, there's every reason to believe they despise dragons and their riders. They hate them so much it's implied they brought about the Doom of Valyria to wipe them out.

&gt;""All gods have their instruments, men and women who serve them and help to work their will on earth. The slaves were not crying out to a hundred different gods, as it seemed, but to one god with a hundred different faces . . . and he was that god's instrument. That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.""

&gt;Arya drew back from him. ""He killed the slave?"" That did not sound right. ""He should have killed the masters!""

&gt;""He would bring the gift to them as well . . . but that is a tale for another day, one best shared with no one.‚Äù

Their dragon hate doesn't seem to have abated in the time since, as Jaqen H'Ghar in AFFC has infiltrated the Citadel in search of a book on how to kill them. Daenerys is probably safe as long as she is focused on liberating slaves, but as soon as she stops, her dragons will make her a priority target for the FM. Which leads directly to the final reason...

**4) The Faceless Men hate life itself.** The Faceless Men hate suffering and see death as a release from it. By itself, that's perhaps not so dangerous. The problem is that for the vast majority of people, life in the ASOIAF universe *sucks.* You toil away in poverty while the high lords play their games with your life until eventually you suffer miserably and die for no good reason at all, from war, famine, plague, or the entertainment of some sick asshole like Ramsay Bolton. Perhaps then, it would be better in the FM's mind if ""all men died,"" not continuously through ""normal"" circumstances, but rather all at once and then no more. The Others are perhaps the best available tool to accomplish this. Some might say that they ""mock death"" by resurrecting the dead. But wights show no signs of retaining the intelligence necessary for suffering, and if your corpse gets rezzed by the Others, it seems likely that ""you,"" the former person with a personality and memories, are still quite dead. On the other hand, the Lord of Light, arch-nemesis of the Great Other, *does* bring people back with their personalities (mostly) intact so they can suffer anew. Look at poor Beric and his many grisly, painful deaths. That's a mockery of the Many Faced God for sure.

If that is the case, then many of the Faceless Men's actions make a lot of sense. Destroying Valyria, the source of Valyrian steel and most of the world's dragons, was an absolutely crippling blow to the world's defenses against the WWs. Empowering Euron by killing Balon Greyjoy will throw Westeros into chaos it can ill afford. Why was Jaqen headed for the Wall in the first place? Perhaps to undermine its defenses through assassination, or to pursue the Horn of Winter. Who really tried to kill Bran, who is essential (in the books at least) for fighting the Others? Perhaps it was a Faceless Man. And why might the FM want Dany dead? Because she and her dragons are the most powerful weapon the world has to fight the Others.

--------------------------------

**Finally, how might we expect this to affect Dany?** Presumably she will survive Missandei's attempt, but given the incredible lethality of the FM, it's likely that at least one of the people close to her will die protecting her. Barristan maybe, or Jorah. Also, if the FM's investigations into dragon-killing bear fruit, it's quite possible that Missandei will kill one, by poison or some other means. This betrayal by Missandei, who is not as important in the books as the show, but is still the closest thing Dany will ever have to a little sister or daughter, will massively increase her paranoia and isolation. The emotional damage would be profound, and could quite easily push her to the brink of madness.

-------------------------------------

Edit: something I forgot to mention initially, is that I think there are strong meta reasons related to S8 to believe the Faceless Men will play a critical role in the end game of the books.

**1) The deeper machinations of the Faceless Men are a plotline that was dropped abruptly and almost completely from the show. Missandei's role within the Faceless Men thus would be a good explanation for why her plotline is so radically divergent from the books.** In order to have her resemble the book's version of Missandei, D&amp;D would have to actually do a proper plotline involving a broader FM conspiracy, which is something they apparently decided was not worth the limited number of episodes they chose to do. Therefore they created the Grey Worm romance and abduction/execution as an alternative.

**2) Without a major plotline with the Faceless Men to give her purpose, Arya will either be useless or intrude egregiously on the character arcs of the other characters.** Arya is not the main character of the book series, but is, at least in GRRM's original conception, one of the [five most important.](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-list-of-5-characters-that-survive-according-to-GRRMs-original-plan-for-ASOIAF-still-relevant) In the show she has taken on what one might say is a disproportionate level of influence, taking over plots that it would make no sense for her to be involved with in the books by murdering important characters. Most notoriously, she destroyed half of the prophecies in the show and Bran + Jon's character arcs by almost single-handedly destroying the WWs in S8E3. She also single-handedly exterminated the entirety of House Frey, taking over aspects of both Lord Manderly and Lady Stoneheart in the books. And she killed Littlefinger, which is possible in the books but sort of odd, given the abruptness with which it happened and the lack of strong narrative connection between the two characters. 

As critical as I am of what they did with her, if this stuff doesn't happen in the books (and we know the NK thing won't, at the very least, since he doesn't exist in the books) *it's unclear what important thing Arya will actually have to do.* Her list includes a bunch of characters who someone else has to kill. Killing Cersei would deny Jaime a major part of his potential arc (and be a major divergence from the show, where the two die together). While killing the Mountain would ruin #Cleganebowl, a grievous crime in the eyes of gods and men if there ever was one. Arya's whole arc is focused on revenge and murder though, so she needs someone to murder.

*The reintroduction of the Faceless Men as a critical part of the endgame will allow Arya to be an important character without interfering with other plot lines.* By either turning on them and helping stop their machinations, or helping them along, her dark path can have significant consequences without ruining the other main characters' story arcs.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;x-post from &lt;a href=""/r/asoiaf""&gt;r/asoiaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GoT, Missandei&amp;#39;s execution at the hands of Ser Robert Strong (Gregor) is one of the final nails in the coffin for Daenerys&amp;#39; sanity and a motivator for Grey Worm and the Unsullied to commit war crimes. It seems quite likely at this point that GRRM&amp;#39;s plan for the books also involves Daenerys burning King&amp;#39;s Landing, although the exact circumstances will almost certainly be different and better foreshadowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key difference will have to be Missandei&amp;#39;s role in driving Daenerys to &amp;quot;madness,&amp;quot; because what happened to her in S8E4 would be complete nonsense in the books. To recap, Euron teleported in with his railgun galleys, casually gunned down a dragon, wrecked her fleet, &lt;em&gt;and completely ignored all of the other people who were now at his mercy to abduct only Missandei.&lt;/em&gt; Then she was somehow identified as extremely important to Daenerys, trotted out to an inexplicable parley that should have ended in Dany and Drogon&amp;#39;s grisly scorpion-inflicted demise, and then executed &lt;em&gt;for zero reason other than the evulz despite her clear value as a hostage and human shield.&lt;/em&gt; This resulted in Dany losing her only friend (she has several Dothraki handmaidens in the books who fill a similar role) and enraged her romantic interest Grey Worm (who is a strictly professional soldier with no romantic attachments in the books for obvious reasons, not to mention a pretty minor character). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s assume &lt;strong&gt;1) Missandei will die in circumstances that contribute to Dany flipping out, 2) it will happen in circumstances that bear almost no resemblance to what happened on the show, and 3) these circumstances were not conducive to the TV show because they related to elements or plots that D&amp;amp;D chose to cut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is one very strong possibility that satisfies all of these conditions: &lt;strong&gt;Missandei is a Faceless Man, sent to spy on Dany and possibly assassinate her at the time of their choosing. This will be revealed near the end of the books and lead to Daenerys developing serious and well-justified paranoia, undermining her mental stability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this to be true, Missandei has to be a Faceless Man. I think there are many reasons to believe this is the case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Book Missandei&amp;#39;s abilities seem inexplicable given her age.&lt;/strong&gt; Like on the show, Book Missandei speaks many languages, including the Common Tongue, High Valyrian, bastard Valyrian, and the dead language of Ghiscari, along with others (a total of twelve according to &lt;a href=""https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/82748-missandei-is-a-faceless-manwoman-perhaps-izembaro/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike on the show, &lt;em&gt;Book Missandei is 10 years old at most when she meets Daenerys.&lt;/em&gt; Now, speaking twelve languages at 10 is very impressive by itself, but not necessarily evidence of something sinister, especially since ASOIAF contains many oddly gifted child characters. However, the scope of her abilities goes well beyond language. She can hear things others don&amp;#39;t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At her command, Missandei stripped off her clothes and climbed in after her. ‚ÄúThis one heard the Astapori scratching at the walls last night,‚Äù the little scribe said as she was washing Dany‚Äôs back.
Irri and Jhiqui exchanged a look. ‚ÄúNo one was scratching,‚Äù said Jhiqui. ‚ÄúScratching ‚Ä¶ how could they scratch?‚Äù
‚ÄúWith their hands,‚Äù said Missandei. ‚ÄúThe bricks are old and crumbling. They are trying to claw their way into the city.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis would take them many years,‚Äù said Irri. ‚ÄúThe walls are very thick. This is known.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is known,‚Äù agreed Jhiqui.
‚ÄúI dream of them as well.‚Äù Dany took Missandei‚Äôs hand.
‚ÄúThe camp is a good half-mile from the city, my sweetling. No one was scratching at the walls.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour Grace knows best,‚Äù said Missandei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can sneak up on a Kingsguard with decades of experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúShe might be flying home,‚Äù he told himself, aloud. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù murmured a soft voice behind him. ‚ÄúShe would not do that, ser. She would not go home without us.‚Äù
Ser Barristan turned. ‚ÄúMissandei. Child. How long have you been standing there?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, when Quentyn is dying of his dragon inflicted burns, she eases his passing when no one else can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missandei sat at the bedside. She had been with the prince night and day, tending to such needs as he could express, giving him water and milk of the poppy when he was strong enough to drink, listening to the few tortured words he gasped out from time to time, reading to him when he fell quiet, sleeping in her chair beside him. Ser Barristan had asked some of the queen‚Äôs cupbearers to help, but the sight of the burned man was too much for even the boldest of them. And the Blue Graces had never come, though he‚Äôd sent for them four times. Perhaps the last of them had been carried off by the pale mare by now.
The tiny Naathi scribe looked up at his approach.
‚ÄúHonored ser. The prince is beyond pain now. His Dornish gods have taken him home. See? He smiles.‚Äù
[Barristan thinks]How can you tell? He has no lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular skill doesn&amp;#39;t overlap with being a scribe at all, &lt;em&gt;but is one of the core skills of the Faceless Men.&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, it would be extremely strange for one ten year old girl to have all these abilities. A Faceless Man, however, could easily have all of them as they could be much more than ten years old, as demonstrated by the waif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waif nodded. Arya nodded back, and in her best Braavosi said, ‚ÄúHow many years have you?‚Äù
The waif showed ten fingers. Then ten again, and yet again. Then six. Her face remained as smooth as still water. She can‚Äôt be six-and-thirty, Arya thought. She‚Äôs a little girl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying,‚Äù she said. The waif shook her head and showed her once again: ten and ten and ten and six. She said the words for six-and-thirty, and made Arya say them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Missandei&amp;#39;s backstory would be ideal cover for a Faceless Man.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the wacky &amp;quot;X character has been replaced by a FM&amp;quot; theories suffer from a problem: in order to convincingly pull off a disguise as that character the FM would have to know enough details about that person&amp;#39;s life to fool people who have strong connections with them. Supposedly the faces a FM uses magically provide some of that person&amp;#39;s memories, but we have little reason to believe that information is comprehensive. However, by virtue of being &amp;quot;from Naath&amp;quot; (supposedly), far far away from almost every other character, &lt;em&gt;there is no one who could possibly verify whether Missandei&amp;#39;s story about her origins is truthful.&lt;/em&gt; The main person who might be able to is her former master Kraznys, and he was dead within days of Missandei meeting Daenerys. There is also the possibility that Book Missandei&amp;#39;s three supposed Unsullied brothers would know, but it&amp;#39;s quite unlikely she has those brothers to begin with. It takes nine years to train an Unsullied, yet Missandei, a ten year old, supposedly remembers playing with her brothers on Naath before they were captured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHe taught me how to climb a tree when we were little. He could catch fish with his hands. Once I found him sleeping in our garden with a hundred butterflies crawling over him. He looked so beautiful that morning, this one ‚Ä¶ I mean, I loved him.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs he loved you.‚Äù Dany stroked the girl‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúSay the word, my sweet, and I will send you from this awful place. I will find a ship somehow and send you home. To Naath.‚Äù
‚ÄúI would sooner stay with you. On Naath I‚Äôd be afraid. What if the slavers came again? I feel safe when I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is clearly impossible&lt;/em&gt; and either proof that GRRM made a rare logical inconsistency, or a sign that she is not who she claims to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Missandei has a couple odd linguistic tells.&lt;/strong&gt; First of which is her frequent usage of &amp;quot;this one&amp;quot; to refer to herself. This is common among other slaves (Grey Worm uses it), but Missandei is far more linguistically adept than those slaves. Surely she should have been able to pick up the word &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; by now? Perhaps this is evidence of a very deep level of depersonalization on her part, exceeding that which an ordinary slave might feel, but typical of someone who has been trained to be &amp;quot;no one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, while the show throws Valar Morghulis around like it&amp;#39;s a super common Essosi greeting, it&amp;#39;s actually quite rare in the books, appearing only &lt;a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-is-Valar-Morghulis-mentioned""&gt;twenty-five&lt;/a&gt; times. Nineteen of those times it is used by Arya, and four of the remaining times it&amp;#39;s used by Jaqen or people in the House of Black and White. The only two people without a clear FM connection to use the phrase are Oberyn (who is a master poisoner, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if he was at least loosely associated with the Faceless Men) and Missandei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI can give you freedom, but not safety,‚Äù Dany warned. ‚ÄúI have a world to cross and wars to fight. You may go hungry. You may grow sick. You may be killed.‚Äù
‚ÄúValar morghulis,‚Äù said Missandei, in High Valyrian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if Missandei is a Faceless Man, why is she infiltrating Dany&amp;#39;s court in the first place? There are several possible reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) The Faceless Men love money.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if they have no agenda of their own, Daenerys is one of the most dangerous people in the world, and has many enemies who would pay a lot to see her die.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A minute. An hour. A month. Death is certain. The time is not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would therefore make good business sense for the FM to have an agent ready and waiting to fulfill that extremely lucrative contract if it ever comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) The Faceless Men hate slavery.&lt;/strong&gt; The cult arose amid the slaves of the Valyrian Empire to &amp;quot;liberate&amp;quot; them from suffering, and currently reside in a city that prides itself on being one of the few places in Essos that has no slaves and does no business with slavers.

Yes, 3YR is the only answer that has sense.

I'e read theories that CoTF are behind 3YR, that they want to destroy mankind, they warged Drogon etc. Might be possible, although not necessary if his/their goal is not to destroy mankind. Why? Actually we don't know what his goal is, but i would bet on two separate goals which are different: first CoTF goal and Bloodraven motives.

Why CoTF would want to destroy humans? Unless Martin was making jokes from the readers they were rather described as peaceful and not able to feel hatred and do violence.

Bran III chapter is the key to understand nature of CoTF. It might be red herring but i doubt it (translated from polish as I don't own the original): ""Men wouldn't be sad. They would be angry and mad. They would be full of hatred and promise bloody vengeance. Singers \[CoTF\] sing sad songs, but men would fight and kill."" This mean that for sure they are not purely evil, like unable to fight back on their own.

They were defenceless, that why they created Others and probably used ""Lord of the light"" crap or green dreams to manipulate people/Giants/creatures to defend them instead. I rather think they're just defending themselves using other living or dead things as tools.

If CoTF wanted to follow their agenda, why they would need Bloodraven in the first place? CoTF were the 3yr greenseeyers, they could get Bran without Bloodraven help, if they needed Bran for anything.

Bloodraven went there for something, maybe to negotiate. Preserve the trees and CoTF, but for some price. I assume he might work with the citadel to remove magic from the world (he already possesed all the knowledge of any magic available through Shiera and citadel knowledge through Aemon) - destroy others, destroy targs and dragons etc. Only then good rulers can bring peace, otherwise Targaryens or Others  will provide chaos for ages or destroy the Westeros. It would also fit CoTF goal of securing survival of them and their trees. Win-Win!

We've been told multiple times in the books, and even by Martin himself that magic in this world is dangerous, it requires sacrifices and usually backfires. CoTF know this, Citadel know this and Bloodraven might also got selfrealization of this.

Take a lesson, Bran. The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword. As the children did.\[28\]

‚ÄîLuwin to Bran Stark

The Horned Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt. There is no safe way to grasp it.\[30\]

‚ÄîDalla to Jon Snow

There is literally no way to bring peace to Westeros and secure survival of CoTF and people that getting rid of all the magic.

&amp;#x200B;

Why CoTF agreed? I assume it's the power of blood magic and revival  that Bloodraven knew thanks to Shiera. He got also powerful allies that could influence the events far more than CoTF - Shiera and possibly their children (Melisandre, Quaithe) through spreading the Lord of the light religion, glass candles and revivals etc. They could manipulate the priests to do what they want through visions in fire. Euron obviously look like some Bloodraven/Shiera apprentice. He might be another tool.

All propehecies which Targs were buying like pelicans were orchestrated by Bloodraven, Maegis or CoTF (Mazzi was influenced by Marwyn, others maegis could have contact with Shiera, witch from high hill that started TPTWP madness was cotf). Even Melisandre was probably a Bloodraven daughter and was manipulated(or she knew who she is and what she's doing, she was cooperating with bloodraven) by him to get to his goal. They can destoy Targs using their own madness, manipulating them through visions, dreams and false prophecies (yes, they are all a sham! All of us are falling into same trap as Targs thinking who will be TPTWP, who will be Azor Ahai, Nissa Nissa, Valonquar and all that crap. It all a sham!). All Targs seems really vulnerable to them. That's how they will turn Dany into madness, by Quaithe dreams, manipulating her advisors etc (if Quaithe is Bloodraven daughter...). Targs will do their job then destroying themselves, just like in Aegon5 in Summerhall, Jaeherys II and orchestrating marriage for TPTWP, Rhaegar seeking TPTWP etc. The mechanism how it work was demonstrated through Cersei and Maegi prophecy which lead Cersei into madness. And Martin makes a lot of foreshadowing in the books that Cersei and Jaime are actually Aerys bastards.

Remember what Marwyn said: Gorghan of Old Ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is... and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams. That is the nature of prophecy, said Gorghan. Prophecy will bite your prick off every time.\[2\]

‚ÄîMarwyn, to Samwell Tarly, Alleras, and the ""Pate"" imposter

Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can.\[2\]

‚ÄîMarwyn, to Samwell Tarly

All those visions and prophecies are just tool of manipulations foe those who pull the strings. And please take note on the word: ""the world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery/prophecy/glass candles, much less for a dragons"". I assume they're also in the big game.

&amp;#x200B;

The question i'm having is who and for what purpose brought Targs to Westeros in the first place? They traveled because of prophetic dream of Daeneys. I assume someone put that dream on purpose to bring them in. Maybe it was CoTF, who planned to use dragons against Others, and then finish with Targaryens after Others are gone to secure their safe place in the North? Or there is another mysterious player on the board, as mad Targaryens are rather creating caos. Littlefinger might a piece of that player.

&amp;#x200B;

We know very little about Valyrian origins and who lead to destruction of Valyria. I assume it was the same player who helped the Targs escape. In WOIAF they are mentioning another race... Some are speculating about strange catastrophe in Ashaii, where the land is desolated. There is lot of additional lore for other countries east of Asshai created in WOIAF and ready for using.  Martin opened a lot of paths for another books and shows for sure and without knowing details about Long Night and rise and fall of Valyria it might hard to explain what is exactly going on in ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

Bran isn't Bran anymore, Bran is just the host body for the Three-Eyed Raven.

Jaime pushing Bran out of the window is what set Bran on his course to becoming the Three-Eyed Raven but how did Jaime of the Kingsguard get into a position to even push Bran out of the window? The Three-Eyed Raven influenced Aerys to become mad setting Jaime on a course to kill him forcing him along the path to become the man who pushed Bran. We've seen how good Jaime can be, if Aerys never went mad then Jaime could continue along his path of being a Golden Knight of a man. Instead, Jaime kills Aerys and is pushed along the path where his main purpose in life is to end up with Cersei. 

I think our current ""Bran""/Three-Eyed Raven is looking for a way to become a ""man"" or part of mankind and put himself in position to rule. Wasn't our last Three-Eyed Raven old and potentially imprisoned in the roots of a weirwood tree? This is his escape.

Who is infamous for wanting to ""Burn Them all?"" Aerys. And who do we know that actually did burn them all? Dany. And I believe the Three-Eyed Raven is behind it all. He played his part in bringing down the Night King, who was originally created to defend against Bran/men and now he's taking down everyone else in his path to being the leader of mankind, or what is left of mankind. Bran is still just in the process of becoming the Three-Eyed Raven, the leader of man and he's **almost** there.

The Three-Eyed Raven and mankind are true evil of this show. 

We'll end the series with Bran as King or leader of the 7 Kingdoms in some fashion. Where he'll have even more control over using mankind for his bidding. I think we'll also see the emergence of a new white walker/Night King/Night Queen: Jon or Dany or even a combo of the two. 

This will also set up one of the spin off series that HBO have been hush hush about that is set in the future where the need for the current actors/actresses is no longer needed because Jon and Dany will be white walkers and everyone else including Bran will either be dead or can be portrayed by an older actor/actress.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaf of the Children of the Forest told Bran they created the white walkers (not necessary the Night King) to defend them &amp;quot;from you (Bran?)...from men.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The closest thing to a happy ending that we are going to get is the victory against the Night King. It highlights one of the main themes of the show, namely that when people put aside their differences to work together, they can achieve great things.

The finale is about other themes though. First, that people who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it. Jon's failure to make moral compromises despite seeing where it led Ned and Robb. Daenerys' failure to avoid repeating (in an even worse way) her father's sins. Tyrion's failure to see the evil in the people he thinks he knows. Sansa's failure to break free from the only game that Littlefinger has ever taught her.

Expect Dany to go full Michael Corleone by trying to dispose of her perceived enemies in order to eliminate any potential threat to her rule. 

Tyrion is a dead man walking after spending most of episode 5 betraying the Dragon Queen for a greater good that never came to be. Davos' involvement in Tyrion's plan will undoubtedly get him branded a traitor. And no one gave Dany more reasons to kill him than Jon. As long as he lives, so will conspiracies to put him on the Iron Throne. He spoke to Sansa. He rejected his aunt's love. He killed one of the soldiers during the attack. And chances are that he will openly turn against her in the same way that got his adoptive father beheaded.

Sansa has a target on her back. Expect Brienne and Podrick to perish trying to honor a pledge to protect Catelyn Stark's daughter. A fatal showdown with Grey Worm would be cool, wouldn't it?

Since we're in the North, Dany might as well get rid of Sam, Gilly and, for good measure, little Sam. They know about Jon's parentage, and Sam's potential grudge against the Mad Queen for what she's done to his family is too much of a risk for her.

Oh, and if they bother to give Gendry some screen time, it will likely be to show another character with some form of claim to the Iron Throne being slaughtered. Tormund and Yara Greyjoy will surely be killed if they dare to appear in the finale.

Speaking of the Iron Throne, if they manage to extract it from the rubbles, expect Drogon to melt it. Dany wants to start a new era and will likely use that excuse to purge the world of anything reminiscent of any rule before hers.

That's bad news for the holder of the history of mankind, namely Bran.

So how will it all play out? I would expect Jon and the northern soldiers to turn against the Unsullied and the Dothraki in the immediate aftermath of the battle and for the northern army to be swiftly annihilated as a result. Then for Jon, Davos and Tyrion to be imprisoned in preparation for a very public execution. Who knows, Sansa and Bran may join them.

Then Drogon prepares to blow them all to ashes, but Bran wargs just in time to stop him and Arya uses a Faceless Man trick to get close enough to Dany and stab her with Needle, saving the day once more. A sorrowful Drogon renounces his ways and flies away with the corpse of his mother, never to be seen again. Poetic, right?

Nah, let's have everybody die instead. Season 1's most important scene is an execution that we never expected to go forward, and from D&amp;D (and GRRM)'s perspective, it only makes sense to finish the series on a comparable bang.

So let the execution be a success. Let Bran warg into Drogon long enough for him to eradicate most of Dany's army, but have someone kill him to bring the warging to a premature halt. The Hound warned Arya to not become like him, and if she follows everyone else's example, she'll do just that and murder Dany out of pure vengeance after witnessing the destruction of her family. Let Drogon roast the last Stark and fly away with his mother's body, leaving everybody dead behind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly certain that not a single character of importance will make it out of the finale alive.&lt;/p&gt;

(In the movie, _Reservoir Dogs_, many of the allegedly-allied characters kill other, and only one character survives.)

1. Bronn arrives to collect his reward.
2. Arya kills Grey Worm &amp; takes his face. 
3. Dany accuses Tyrion (&amp; Davos?) of treason. 
4. Tyrion wants trial by combat with Bronn as his champion. Bronn accepts.
5. Grey Worm (Arya) fights Bronn. If Bronn wins, Arya dies. If Bronn loses, Tyrion dies. We, the audience are horrified. Arya knows how to use the spear and kills Bronn.
6. Therefore, Tyrion loses the trial and Dany executes Tyrion (&amp; Davos?). 
7. Dany, Jon and Grey Worm go inside. (Because we can't have Drogon interfere, and maybe so Dany can almost touch the throne to match her vision.)
8. Arya, with Grey Worm's face, kills (mortally wounds) Dany.
9. Jon is shocked but immediately kills Grey Worm.
10. Jon learns he actually killed Arya. (Stupid like Scobby Doo, or elegant like Arya seeing her own face on a dead man.)
11. Optional: Dany dies in Jon's arms.
12. Optional: Davos isn't executed. Warden of the South or the West? Advisor to Jon?
13. Optional: separately, I posted a way for Arya to kill Drogon.

I think the unresolved surviving characters are:

* Sansa, to rule Winterfell and be Warden of the North
* Brienne, protector of Sansa, or perhaps Warden of the West, or perhaps pregnant with a Lannister, Warden of the South
* Sam, to become an advisor to Jon
* Gilly, probably treated as just an accessory to Sam
* Gendry, Warden of the East
* Bran, three-eyed raven

Bran needed a way to guarantee that Westeros would never accept Dany as their leader instead of Jon.

With King‚Äôs Landing utterly destroyed, Winterfell could become the new capital.

or (my favorite, however implausible)

In a Watchmen-esque turn, Bran knew that history would only repeat itself if anyone took the throne. He needed a moment to show Westeros that they could not continue this cycle, to save from the countless suffering that would be sure to reoccur.

Even though Dany has been under stress, it feels implausible that she would now slaughter innocents for no reason.

Dany would have begun the slaughter by killing Cersei.

Bran has had a disappointingly minor impact on the story up to this point, given the degree of his powers. Also, as a producer, don‚Äôt you want him to warg a dragon at *some* point?

If Bran warg‚Äôd into the horse that saved Arya, he must have know what was going on there, and could have at least warg‚Äôd into Drogon to end the violence.

For me, this is the first season I have watched on a week to week basis. I started watching season 1 during season 4 probably. When they killed Ned, I stopped watching. It stayed that way for close to two years and then I finally picked it back up. I got caught up right after season 7 ended, and then had to wait this excruciating two years. I was super excited for the season 8 premiere and I have enjoyed every episode. I know the general consensus on here is not on my side with it, but I really like where they have taken the story. It was obvious during season 7 that Daenerys was headed down the wrong path. It was also always obvious to me that the story was never about the dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew nothing about the books as I am not a reader at all. This has kept me interested enough that I might eventually try to read them to learn more about the history and things like that. Its called ""Game of Thrones"" because its about the fight for the throne. Not because its about an army of the dead. The dead, from what we have learned, wanted to wipe out all of Humanity. They never cared about sitting on a throne. Why would the show be revolved around them when its called ""game of Thrones?""

&amp;#x200B;

Lets point out some theories:

* Arya is dead
* Arya was wearing Jamie's face leading Cersei to death
* Littlefinger is alive
* Rhaegal is alive
* John is dead and Jaqen is wearing his face
* Ned is alive
* Daenerys is an actual dragon
* Bran is Azor Ahai

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously? I mean it's like we are throwing shit at everything to see what it sticks to. Is it possible that someone is alive that we thought was dead? Sure but not this many people. They have gave us unexpected twists all through the series but everybody that has died, has stayed dead this far. With the exception of being brought back by magic which we have seen happen. But no one that died has just showed up later just for a surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya? She still has to kill green eyes right? I don't think so. I've been saying for weeks that she has already fulfilled that. 

* Brown-Walder Frey
* Green-Littlefinger
* Blue-Night King

My theory about her is that she is Azor Ahai. Now I'm not just going to throw that out there without giving you my reasoning. I feel like she was ""reborn"" three times. The first time was when Ned was executed. She was made into a boy to avoid detection and her path was changed forever. During this, the red comet (bleeding star), was in the sky. Next was at Bravvos when she became no one by the sea (salt). Finally she was reborn under the smoke at Winterfell when she stepped up and killed the Night King. I made a post about this right after EP3. Lightbringer was the only part I hadnt figured out but thought it could be something to do with the catspaw dagger. Still could be. The next hour and twenty minutes will tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Who's going to sit on the throne? I have heard everything from Littlefinger to Bran to Gendry to the Night King!! I have no idea who it will be but I can tell you this, It doesn't really matter since all the people are mostly wiped out now. No one is going to serve Daenerys after what she has done. I feel like Daenerys will live and rule Kings Landing because no one else will want it now. Whoever sits on the Iron Throne rules all the seven kingdoms but the other kingdoms don't get much direction from Kings Landing from what we have seen. Maybe they rebuild Kings Landing and Daenerys realizes what she has done and how no one will ever trust her again and goes off to live in exile. Maybe she stays crazy and burns the rest of the world. Maybe she is killed by Jon or Arya or Tyrion or somebody else. Maybe Gendry or Sansa or somebody else is selected to rule. Who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

There's one episode left so there isn't much time to throw in a whole lot of twist when they still have to put everything to bed. I have said for a while that I think Sansa will end up there but that is a total guess. I feel like she has to something significant or they wouldn't have kept her alive this long. Everyone has had a role except her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bran? I believe Bran is exactly what he says he is. ""The Three Eyed Raven!"" He is the memory of mankind. Nothing more. 

I could be wrong as I have been many times, but I don't think there is much more to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Where it all ends, nobody knows. But I for one am very excited to find out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'll take some heat for this post and that's fine.

So there are some mixed reactions to Dany going ape shit and bribing Kings landing and the innocent civilians within the city walls, even after hearing the bells.

I do not believe she is mad at the people, I think she really, really wanted to kill Cersei and take the throne  with fire and blood but not the blood of innocents.

I think that Dany was actually going to just destroy the red keep and kill Cersei but something happened before she could get to the red keep. I think Bran warged into either Dany or Drogon to control the dragon (I think he warged into Dany). Now why would he do that? Idk dude Bran is so creepy and at this point nobody knows his motive. Dany keeps mentioning that this is the LAST war and this may very well be the last war. Bran knows this but also knows that this will only be the last war with Jon on the throne and not Dany. Bran knows that Jon will not rule by choice and he needs to be placed on the throne my some force, so Bran has to destroy Daenerys chances at becoming queen. He does this by making it seem like she killed thousands of innocent civilians. My theory hold further by the fact that we barely see Dany on the dragon and only see the flames and destruction. Furthermore, Bran as the three-eyed raven is very detached and would do something like killing thousands to see generations in the future prosper. CLEGANEBOWL WAS SICK!!!! xD

I personally find it hard to believe that a show and network that have put so much effort and attention to detail would just let the story go to absolute and complete shit. I believe that these lackluster 5 episodes were done on purpose specifically to get the fans, especially hardcore fans, pissed off. Going into this season there has been the most hype and anticipation for any show I've ever seen, which ratcheted up expectations. No matter how the story would have been told this season, people wouldn't have been satisfied because of the sky high expectations, as a lot of satisfaction is tied to expectations. They needed to bring down everyone's expectations only to bring them back with a surprise 2-hour finale, with a great, surprise but not surprise ending (if you're interested, check out my post ""Theorion""... it's from a while ago, but been continually updating it over the last year and a half... sorry I dont really post on reddit very often so I dont know how to make a hyperscript link to it). I think they also have been essentially showing nothing this season because if they show anything to openly, it will give away the ending.

I also think that they will have a surprise 2 (possibly more) hour finale because if they were offered 8 hours worth of production funding as has been said, I find it very difficult to believe that D&amp;D just said ""nah, were good... we got this... more money and more time never solved production and story issues."" I think the idea that the finale of the most expensive and epic saga ever witnessed on television being the same length as the previous 3 extremely meaningless episodes before is crazy talk. The runtimes of the episodes were released weirdly early to me, and I think this was done to get the runtime of 80 mins (60 and 80, nice round numbers, easy to remember) engrained into your memory so you think theres no way they can get this done in 80 mins, then SURPRISE, it's 120. 

[(60x2)+(80x4)] = 440 tot mins... 440/60 = 7.33 hrs

[(60√ó2)+(80√ó3)+120 = 480... 480 mins/60 = 8 hrs

The second option makes a lot more sense to me.

If the theories I've posted about before are correct, which I believe they are going to be for the most part as it's the only thing that makes sense full story wise, it makes sense why they went about it this way as anything else would have given it away. I believe way too much has been invested in this series to end it with some bullshit human politics, which is precisely opposite to the theme of the story, and I think also the theme of Cersei's very unceremonious death. The point is she doesnt matter. It's only our hatred towards her that has made her matter.  Everyone wanted that pay off of a brutal death for Cersei, but rather she died terrified and completely powerless, while begging not to die, which is the complete opposite of what she always tries to portray outwardly.

EDIT: added ""You need this to be a success and create a real and sticky fanbase as HBO's % of the market share in premium TV drastically decreasing with a lot of new, deep pocketed entrants into the market since this series started.""

EDIT: I think these ""leaks"" were actually released by HBO as part of the long con for an extra long, epic finale. It makes a lot of sense and this is the best thing to do to get people off of the scent. After the leaks from last season were essentially spot on, people would absolutely assume that the leaks for the last 3 episodes are legit because we had that last year and it was a big topic of conversation. It seems odd and conveniently timed that the plots for episodes 4-6 were leaked, narratively immediately following the extremely lackluster killing of the NK, which would have absolutely incensed fans beforehand if they had known, as it did in real time. Now we have leaked plots for episodes 4 and 5, which I haven't looked at but from the general sentiment I see on my homepage as I scroll through reddit is that they were accurate. This would make sense with my theory because from the viewer's vantage point, nothing happens in those episodes. We don't actually see any meaningful story development in these two episodes, although one probably happened off screen (read my previous posts if you're interested.) If your main goal is to throw people off the scent of a surprise extra long and epic finale, the best way to do that would be to piggyback on the confidence fans have in leak accuracy due to last season, then release accurate ""leaks"" of episode 4 and 5 where narratively, nothing happens. This will build confidence in the audience about the authenticity of the leaks, leading them to believe the episode 6 ""leak"" is true because, why wouldn't it be? Every other legit leak has been true thus far, why wouldn't this leak be right? This brings expectations wayyyy down as everyone expects a shitty end and then BOOM, extra long, crazy epic finale. This makes a lot more sense than HBO setting fire to by far their most valuable asset that has likely generated billions over its run, all revenue streams considered. Not to mention the return on asset isn't even complete yet as HBO still hopes to draw multiple more series from the World of Ice and Fire (there were 5 proposals to HBO for possible series' last year.)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they have made the last 5 episodes and certain arcs lackluster to extremely temper expectations, only to bring it all the way back with what I think will be a two hour finale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find it hard to believe that a show and network that have put so much effort and attention to detail would just let the story go to absolute and complete shit. I believe that these lackluster 5 episodes were done on purpose specifically to get the fans, especially hardcore fans, pissed off. Going into this season there has been the most hype and anticipation for any show I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, which ratcheted up expectations. No matter how the story would have been told this season, people wouldn&amp;#39;t have been satisfied because of the sky high expectations, as a lot of satisfaction is tied to expectations. They needed to bring down everyone&amp;#39;s expectations only to bring them back with a surprise 2-hour finale, with a great, surprise but not surprise ending (if you&amp;#39;re interested, check out my post &amp;quot;Theorion&amp;quot;... it&amp;#39;s from a while ago, but been continually updating it over the last year and a half... sorry I dont really post on reddit very often so I dont know how to make a hyperscript link to it). I think they also have been essentially showing nothing this season because if they show anything to openly, it will give away the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that they will have a surprise 2 (possibly more) hour finale because if they were offered 8 hours worth of production funding as has been said, I find it very difficult to believe that D&amp;amp;D just said &amp;quot;nah, were good... we got this... more money and more time never solved production and story issues.&amp;quot; I think the idea that the finale of the most expensive and epic saga ever witnessed on television being the same length as the previous 3 extremely meaningless episodes before is crazy talk. The runtimes of the episodes were released weirdly early to me, and I think this was done to get the runtime of 80 mins (60 and 80, nice round numbers, easy to remember) engrained into your memory so you think theres no way they can get this done in 80 mins, then SURPRISE, it&amp;#39;s 120. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[(60x2)+(80x4)] = 440 tot mins... 440/60 = 7.33 hrs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[(60√ó2)+(80√ó3)+120 = 480... 480 mins/60 = 8 hrs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option makes a lot more sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the theories I&amp;#39;ve posted about before are correct, which I believe they are going to be for the most part as it&amp;#39;s the only thing that makes sense full story wise, it makes sense why they went about it this way as anything else would have given it away. I believe way too much has been invested in this series to end it with some bullshit human politics, which is precisely opposite to the theme of the story, and I think also the theme of Cersei&amp;#39;s very unceremonious death. The point is she doesnt matter. It&amp;#39;s only our hatred towards her that has made her matter.  Everyone wanted that pay off of a brutal death for Cersei, but rather she died terrified and completely powerless, while begging not to die, which is the complete opposite of what she always tries to portray outwardly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t believe that HBO would essentially light their most valuable property on fire and end it with politics, leave a sour taste in all the real fans mouths, and then put out a a series about the Long Night and the magical Age of Heroes.

Just a quick theory/idea I had that would have atleast improved the season and its story line to a somewhat true to the novels complexity level.

I believe they should have ran with the whole 3ER is actually the big baddie of the series.

Over the years the 3ER's true target has been man. They were to blame for everything going to shit. He manipulates the Jon and Co into fighting the White Walkers to eliminate the Night King as he cannot do this by himself. Once this has been done he's done exactly what he had done to the Mad King and began to whisper to Dany to drive her insane. That would explain the shift in her mental state and would ultimately cause man to crumble beneath Drogon.

Just a quick theory/idea I had that would have atleast improved the season and its story line to a somewhat true to the novels complexity level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe they should have ran with the whole 3ER is actually the big baddie of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years the 3ER&amp;#39;s true target has been man. They were to blame for everything going to shit. He manipulates the Jon and Co into fighting the White Walkers to eliminate the Night King as he cannot do this by himself. Once this has been done he&amp;#39;s done exactly what he had done to the Mad King and began to whisper to Dany to drive her insane. That would explain the shift in her mental state and would ultimately cause man to crumble beneath Drogon.&lt;/p&gt;

That theory was essentially disproved this episode, but there are some elements to it that I have revised/ salvaged below after the events of episode 5.  Here is the previous theory if you want to read it. https://redd.it/bm9b2g

Bottom Line Up Front - Arya mounted the pale horse, the god of the dothraki, and will kill Dany.  Dany will not let Jon near her, Arya is the only one with the skills necessary to get near Dany.

Ok, so first of all, Dany has clearly chosen to rule by fear.  She has also clearly identified Jon as having betrayed her.  I do not think this means that she will kill Jon, but I think she is past love.  She realized in episode 5 that Jon was her last chance to be loved and he rejected her. This, coupled with Jon's ""betrayal"" makes Jon untrustworthy to Dany.  She is smart, she wont let him near her, especially after her massacre.  I dont think she even remotely thinks that she can try to explain that one to Jon. So I dont think that Jon will be given a chance to kill dany. Side note, I see a Jon and Greyworm showdown coming.

A lot of people took Arya riding the pale horse as her becoming the god of death because of the book of revelations qoute.  But I dont buy it.  The books or series have never really been heavy with biblical symbols. But there is a symbol that is relevant.  In the Dothraki culture, there is a prince that will mount the world (the prince who is promised maybe?) and this prince will ride a pale horse.  A pale horse is also the symbol for the god of the Dothraki.  Dany was also gifted a pale horse when she was made the queen of the Dothraki.  I believe that the Arya mounting the pale horse is symbolic of Arya mounting the God of the Dothraki.  If Dany is accepted as the Queen of the Dothraki, then I believe that this is foreshadowing Arya ""mounting"" Dany (I mean killing, not a lesbian joke).

And realistically, Arya is the only one who has the ability to get near Dany anymore, she can wear the face of someone Dany trusts. Greyworm is the only one left who Dany trusts.  Jon will kill Greyworm.  Arya will become Greyworm.  Arya as Greyworm will get close to Dany and kill her.  And lets not forget that Arya also has a valyrian steel sword (dagger), which could possibly tie in to some other theories about the prince who was promised...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so last week I posted a theory about who Arya&amp;#39;s real target in King&amp;#39;s Landing was.

There is only one legitimate answer in my mind: \*some\* execution of a power shift towards the common people is going to take place. It would make sense given the breaking of the wheel, given the white walkers as a unification-of-humanity medium, given Varys, given Cersei's oppressive rule, given Arya's/NO ONE's ongoing sympathies towards common folk, and given pretty much every major story arc in the series. My first thought was then that a commoner would sit on the Iron Throne, but Ser Davos is really the only candidate here and him sitting on the Iron Throne doesn't make much sense for many reasons. The only other possibility that makes sense is that Westeros is broken up and no longer unified under the Iron Throne.

The North would remain The North under Sansa (NO ONE except the North rules the North, we've been told hundreds of times), the wildlings would remain fiercely independent and have a non-class societal structure as they always have, the Ironborne would be ruled for the first time by a revolutionary, non-raping, and non-pillaging leader in Yara, etc. It makes sense.

So who wins the Iron Throne? NO ONE. NO ONE breaks the wheel, NO ONE wins the Iron Throne - a Game of Thrones is not about the Game of Thrones, it's about breaking the Game of Thrones. Any one character sitting on the Iron Throne would not accomplish this.

Going into the final episode, the theme of the common people is seen everywhere. JS/AT will die, taking Daenerys and Drogon with him (although Arya/the common folk/NO ONE so directly defeating Daenerys and breaking the wheel would also make sense). Sansa will rule Winterfell, Yara the Iron Islands, Ser Davos Dragonstone, Tyrion what's left of King's Landing.

 All of us assumed that the great darkness was The Night King, then we thought it was Cercie but with last episode its clear that the show intended Danny to be it's Big Bad for the series and in order to defeat her Azor Ahai is needed. Most of the people watching the series and reading the books have always thought Jon Snow to be the one and I think the same. 

  

According to me, Danny is both Nissa Nissa and the Darkness in this scenario. She is both the woman Jon loves and the Evil that is threatening the Realm. In order to do the right thing and to save everyone, Jon is going to sacrifice his love and would plunge [Longclaw](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Longclaw) into Danny's Heart.

But that doesn't mean that Jon gets the Iron Throne. In my opinion, Jon being the honourable Man he is, he will punish himself as he killed the Queen he bent the Knee to which is treason in his eyes. He will go back to The Wall and will live out his days as the Man of the Knights Watch in order to pay for the crime he committed.

Now the question arises that who will get the Iron Throne? My bets are on Sansa Stark- Lady of Winterfell. Who better to rule Westeros than the student of two great players in the Game of Thrones ( Cercie Lannister and Littlefinger).

&amp;#x200B;

Daeny has been the 'breaker of chains' and mentions in 8|5 that across the sea the people had always risen to overthrow their masters. In westeros everyone seems to be mostly OK with their leader being crazy as long as it doesn't cramp their style too much. She can't believe people haven't risen up to join her cause and overthrow someone as truly awful as Cersei.

It is her view that to 'break the wheel' the people must rise up to do so, so she is going to do something truly horrible and become the leader everyone thinks she is in order to make them fight.

She will ultimately sacrifice herself (and Drogon) to Jon and his forces to bring about the change the 7 kingdoms needs.

She will die a villain, but deliver salvation to the kingdom as an unknown martyr. Only Jon will know the truth and it will cause him to move north of the wall and forsake the Kingdom that is his. Few characters will know the truth about Daeny until Jon tells Sam, and Sam writes the history years later (the Tolkein nod).

Daenerys is unfit if not completely ‚Äúmad‚Äù.   Not to mention the impracticalities of dealing with a dragon that no one can control from killing and eating your subjects.  Her quest for the throne will be thwarted and she will be killed by a ‚Äúgroup effort‚Äù. 

That group effort will have its roots in the scrolls that Varys was successful in sending out before he was brutally and tyrannically executed.  Scrolls will have been successful in getting to Gendry at Storm‚Äôs End; Tormund and the Wildlings in the North, and the Prince of Dorne.  They will all be gathering forces and heading towards Jon Snow, Aegon Targareyn, to declare their support for him. 

In addition, since Daenerys‚Äô and Jon‚Äôs departures from Winterfell, neither Sansa nor Sam Tarly have remained silent.  Sansa, with the assistance of Bran‚Äôs visions of the future, has informed every remaining Northern House, village, person, and the Lord of the Eyrie and the houses of the Vale that Jon is the rightful heir to the throne and that Daenerys will only enslave the North once more under the thumb of King‚Äôs Landing.  These Northern Houses with Sansa, Bran and Brienne will join Tormund and the wildlings on their march south to back Jon‚Äôs claim.  

Once Sansa and Co reaches The Neck, they will be joined by Howland and Meera Reed who can verify Jon‚Äôs parentage, and  they will continue on to that part of Westeros that is closest to Dragonstone or to a secretly agreed upon location between Sansa and Arya and Davos and Gendry.  

Sam has gone South and West through the Reach and to Oldtown (after sending Ravens, of course) explaining the recent course of events and promising his return with the books as evidence to prove Jon Snow‚Äôs parentage and claim to the throne.  With Sam‚Äôs arrival and the production of the evidence, plus Daenerys‚Äô destruction of King‚Äôs Landing, the Arch Maester of the Citadel decides to finally act and send a delegation to Dragonstone or a neutral location with the official proof that Jon is Aegon Targareyn and the rightful heir to rule Westeros.  

In the meantime, since the destruction of King‚Äôs Landing, Varys‚Äô little birds‚Äô poison will be weakening Daenerys‚Äô body, mind and soul.  She will arrest and imprison Tyrion for betraying her and will sentence him to death.  Jon will be fighting with himself, desperately trying to reason with Daenerys while all the while knowing that she is not fit to rule and cannot possibly be allowed to take the throne.  This will buy all of the above mentioned players a little time to assemble close by, which of course Jon knows nothing about until, if at all, very late in the game, much like in the Battle of the Bastards.  

How Daenerys is actually killed - there are too many variables - But, she is miserable, she is alone, no one in Westeros loves her anymore after what she has done - not even Jon - and there is no way possible that anyone in Westeros will EVER love her after what she has done.  Her life‚Äôs ambition to take back the Iron throne and achieve the love of her people and rule and preside over a just society is over, and now she cannot see any way for her life to have any fulfillment in the future.  Once allowed a moment or two (day or more, this is Westeros time after all) for some reflection and the ‚Äúmad‚Äù Targaryen Adrenalin to drain from her veins, and the above stated realizations to soberly take hold, Daenerys may remember the vision she experienced in the House of the Undying - specifically the part re: spending the rest of eternity with her baby son and Khal Drogo.  This vision will offer her peace and unending love, vs having to face a life dealing with the hate of the Westerosi people, the disappointment and pity instead of love from Jon, and her own shame at what she has allowed herself to become - worse than her father - therefore she will elect to commit suicide by taking Jon‚Äôs hand holding his sword and voluntarily plunging it in her chest.  In doing this she at least makes a final honorable decision, and the Azor Ahai prophecy is fulfilled. 

Jon frees Tyrion from the dungeon cells.  

It would be magically wonderful if Jon‚Äôs Targareyn bond with Drogon could somehow extend to controlling him from indiscriminately killing whatever he wants to eat.   But as I have said in a previous post, since the defeat of the WWs, GRRM has left the fantasy elements behind in this story.  Therefore the best we can hope for Drogon is that somehow he knows to fly home to Valyeria and never to leave there again, or Daenerys kills him before she kills herself.  

When faced with the support of the different factions from all over Westeros, including that of the Wildlings - a people who were once not considered fit to live within the boundaries of Westeros - Jon will come to understand Westeros‚Äô need for him to lead the country at this time.  

However, since King‚Äôs Landing has been destroyed, and since it was determined to be the capital by Aegon Targareyn I hundreds of years ago, there is no reason a new Targareyn King cannot chose the site of a new capital in its place.  And if you have a Northern King, you can have a Northern capital, hospitable to direwolves, or one more so than King‚Äôs Landing from where AegonVI will be more comfortable living and ruling. 

Furthermore, the govt of Westeros will not be the same as it was.  JS/AT will institute reforms that ‚Äúbreak the wheel‚Äù as Daenerys had stated but maybe not quite as she had erringly envisioned.  

Due to her new found insight on what ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù can do to you, Arya will spend her life with Gendry, either as his wife and lady or his life‚Äôs partner, call it what you will.  

Tyrion will be Lord of Casterly Rock. I think he has had enough of political intrigue for a while, and wants to go home and concentrate on starting his own family and doing for them what his father could not do for him and his siblings.  

Ser Davos will be JS/AT‚Äôs Hand of the King.  

Sansa is JS/AT‚Äôs first cousin.  In modern time that is too close for marital relations.  I‚Äôm not so sure it was too close for medieval times, or even in Westerosi lands.  Sansa is clearly the strongest political female figure left hanging without throne, House seat, or marriage.  

Bran is the eldest male Stark so he is the Lord of Winterfell, whether or not he is the Three eyed raven.  
Yes, he can give it up and go live in a tree somewhere and leave Sansa to run Winterfell on her own as Warden of the North.  But if the new capital is in the North or more Northern, then that title rings pretty hollow for all Sansa has been through.  

I recall a conversation Catelyn had with Sansa early in the first few episodes about marriage and duty and love, and that marriage is about duty and hard work and that love grows over time.  She said that love was not there for her and Ned at first but love and mutual respect had grown overtime.  Sansa and JS/AT have mutual respect and a sort of love between them.  You can‚Äôt even call it sisterly because that is what he definitely has with Arya.  What love he has with Sansa has been kept more formal and at arm‚Äôs length; and, due to those very circumstances it will be possible for JS/AT and Sansa to see each other in a different light.  I believe there are seeds of this in both GRRM‚Äôs books and/or D&amp;amp;D‚Äôs TV series, and they may be leading to a not unhappy or unsuccessful marriage/partnership between Sansa and JS/AT, the next King and Queen of Westeros.  

AND JUST THINK - IT‚ÄôS MORE ICE AND FIRE.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;King‚Äôs Landing is destroyed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys is unfit if not completely ‚Äúmad‚Äù.   Not to mention the impracticalities of dealing with a dragon that no one can control from killing and eating your subjects.  Her quest for the throne will be thwarted and she will be killed by a ‚Äúgroup effort‚Äù. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That group effort will have its roots in the scrolls that Varys was successful in sending out before he was brutally and tyrannically executed.  Scrolls will have been successful in getting to Gendry at Storm‚Äôs End; Tormund and the Wildlings in the North, and the Prince of Dorne.  They will all be gathering forces and heading towards Jon Snow, Aegon Targareyn, to declare their support for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, since Daenerys‚Äô and Jon‚Äôs departures from Winterfell, neither Sansa nor Sam Tarly have remained silent.  Sansa, with the assistance of Bran‚Äôs visions of the future, has informed every remaining Northern House, village, person, and the Lord of the Eyrie and the houses of the Vale that Jon is the rightful heir to the throne and that Daenerys will only enslave the North once more under the thumb of King‚Äôs Landing.  These Northern Houses with Sansa, Bran and Brienne will join Tormund and the wildlings on their march south to back Jon‚Äôs claim.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Sansa and Co reaches The Neck, they will be joined by Howland and Meera Reed who can verify Jon‚Äôs parentage, and  they will continue on to that part of Westeros that is closest to Dragonstone or to a secretly agreed upon location between Sansa and Arya and Davos and Gendry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam has gone South and West through the Reach and to Oldtown (after sending Ravens, of course) explaining the recent course of events and promising his return with the books as evidence to prove Jon Snow‚Äôs parentage and claim to the throne.  With Sam‚Äôs arrival and the production of the evidence, plus Daenerys‚Äô destruction of King‚Äôs Landing, the Arch Maester of the Citadel decides to finally act and send a delegation to Dragonstone or a neutral location with the official proof that Jon is Aegon Targareyn and the rightful heir to rule Westeros.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, since the destruction of King‚Äôs Landing, Varys‚Äô little birds‚Äô poison will be weakening Daenerys‚Äô body, mind and soul.  She will arrest and imprison Tyrion for betraying her and will sentence him to death.  Jon will be fighting with himself, desperately trying to reason with Daenerys while all the while knowing that she is not fit to rule and cannot possibly be allowed to take the throne.  This will buy all of the above mentioned players a little time to assemble close by, which of course Jon knows nothing about until, if at all, very late in the game, much like in the Battle of the Bastards.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Daenerys is actually killed - there are too many variables - But, she is miserable, she is alone, no one in Westeros loves her anymore after what she has done - not even Jon - and there is no way possible that anyone in Westeros will EVER love her after what she has done.  Her life‚Äôs ambition to take back the Iron throne and achieve the love of her people and rule and preside over a just society is over, and now she cannot see any way for her life to have any fulfillment in the future.  Once allowed a moment or two (day or more, this is Westeros time after all) for some reflection and the ‚Äúmad‚Äù Targaryen Adrenalin to drain from her veins, and the above stated realizations to soberly take hold, Daenerys may remember the vision she experienced in the House of the Undying - specifically the part re: spending the rest of eternity with her baby son and Khal Drogo.  This vision will offer her peace and unending love, vs having to face a life dealing with the hate of the Westerosi people, the disappointment and pity instead of love from Jon, and her own shame at what she has allowed herself to become - worse than her father - therefore she will elect to commit suicide by taking Jon‚Äôs hand holding his sword and voluntarily plunging it in her chest.  In doing this she at least makes a final honorable decision, and the Azor Ahai prophecy is fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon frees Tyrion from the dungeon cells.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be magically wonderful if Jon‚Äôs Targareyn bond with Drogon could somehow extend to controlling him from indiscriminately killing whatever he wants to eat.   But as I have said in a previous post, since the defeat of the WWs, GRRM has left the fantasy elements behind in this story.  Therefore the best we can hope for Drogon is that somehow he knows to fly home to Valyeria and never to leave there again, or Daenerys kills him before she kills herself.  &lt;/p&gt;

1) Jon doesn‚Äôt want the Iron throne or whatever that remains of it. Also he loved two people in his life, with both gone he might denounce even that aspect of his life making him perfect for the Night‚Äôs Watch and the 1000th Lord commander of the Watch is just too significant a number to not be played on. A fitting end for him especially with how he actually belongs in the North, the far North.

2) Tyrion and Sansa : the earlier episodes of THIS season have tried extremely hard to make us feel that Tyrion cares a lot for the people, the innocents and shown his merciful and just side. He was made hand of the queen because he was smart and guess who has been claimed this season as the smartest person by a character who has traveled a lot and even met Lord Tywin Lannister? Sansa Stark.

They have invested a lot in these two to not have them ruling Westeros fulfilling Sansa‚Äôs dream of season 1 as well.

3) Gendry can keep rowing himself to Storm‚Äôs End and when he reaches there finally, Storm‚Äôs End would finally have a Baratheon ruler

4) Drogon could go back to Valyria but I suspect GoT has one last horrible death waiting for us and the only person I can see capable of swinging the sword on Drogon while he weeps next to his Dead mother is Jon (symbolising killing the Targarean in him as well) although to please the fans more they could have Arya kill Drogon with the weapon gendry made for her ( And on being asked why she didn‚Äôt have it in episode 5 ,D and D could give their trademark answer..Need I say more..","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure most of us would now believe we are going to see Dany die (I‚Äôm predicting by poison from Martha,Varys‚Äôs little bird,representing the common folk the very people who Dany destroyed.. if you want to read more on that check my earlier post) in the last episode after they made her the ‚ÄòMad Queen‚Äô .

After years of constant war, most of the economy in Westeros has probably gone to shit.

I don't want to make this too much of a wall of text, so I try to keep it short.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Overview**

As Westeros can be best described as a feudal society, we can assume that most of its inhabitants are peasants who mostly work in agriculture. Some larger cities exist around the kingdoms, most notably Kings Landing, Oldtown, Lannisport, Gulltown and White Harbour. Urbanisation is low and the agricultural sector dominant, with a notable part of the population involved in primitive subsistence farming in the more remote mountainous areas of Westeros.

As we all know, the seasons last several years, with the show/books starting in late summer. At this point, just before the final episode, we are somewhere in (late?) winter. Recruiting an army means recruiting peasants, which are therefore not available to work in the harvest. As a sidenote, I vaguely remember that during the war of the 5 kings, Robb Stark sends a bunch of his army home to bring in the harvest. Don't know iirc. Also, a large army on the march needs supplies which usually are taken from the land the army is marching through. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, look at Westeros at this point, after s8e5, region by region.

&amp;#x200B;

**The North (including beyond the wall)**

Large areas are depopulated. North of the wall, the free folk suffered an icy genocide. Same goes for Last Hearth. Northmen soldiers fought in the war of the five kings, later under Bolton command against Stannis Baratheon, against each other in the battle of the bastards, got decimated in the fight against the NK, and finally sacked King's Landing. Winter isn't over yet and after all the fighting and armies constantly on the march, food supplies are low as well. White Harbour, the largest city, has silver mines as an income source and can probably import food from Essos. So White Harbour is doing somewhat ok, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Riverlands**

Fucked. Years of constant wars and armies scorching the land. With House Tully and House Frey basically wiped out, local noble houses rival for power in the region. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Westerlands**

Used to be rich because of their gold mines. However, [the mines ran dry years ago](https://youtu.be/xqIyVtlxbW8?t=76). Tywin had some banking business going on to keep running the floor, but with the recent developments, to me it looks like this business has failed. Also, the constant wars have cost a lot of money and the Westerlands have suffered quite severe losses over the last years. Therefore I'd say Lannisport is in a state of economic decline.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Reach**

Similar story here. A bunch of wars and a large pile of bodies. Highgarden got sacked by the Lannisters in s7, the loot burned down by some fiery bois. However, having the most fertile lands and Oldtown unscathed by the wars, conditions for a fast economic recovery are looking good.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Crownlands**

A bit dusty atm. The largest city of Westeros got burned to the ground and it's people slaughtered by a horde of resurrected Dothraki who died charging into a bunch of dead people but are somehow still alive. With King's Landing gone, most trade across the Narrow Sea has collapsed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Dorne**

Pretty much unscathed by the wars. Export markets for Dornish goods aren't looking good right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Vale**

Similar to Dorne, the Vale stayed out of most wars. With fewer exotic goods to export and a lot of mountain clans living on subsistence farming, the Vale is less affected by the collapsed trade routes.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Free Cities**

We don't know exact numbers for the Iron Bank, but I'd say constantly funding people in Westeros who die a short while later isn't the best business model. With the collapsed trade across the Narrow Sea, a large financial crisis in Essos doesn't sound unlikely to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**The best places to be right now:**

1. Qarth - probably far away enough from all the bullshit. Nice and sunny all year round! 
2. The North - It's free real estate!
3. Dorne - Get some of that juicy wine!

I know, GoT is a fantasy story. At times, it was so good, that I forgot about this. My fault.

SPOILER. THEORY

Last week I posted a theory that many of you entertained and some liked. see here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bnf6z2/sansa\_is\_about\_to\_make\_her\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bnf6z2/sansa_is_about_to_make_her_play/)

Now I am about to double down on that theory as to what will happen in the next and final episode.Ladies and Gents please put on your biggest tin foil hats. You will need them.

Now to be fair, I did not expect Dany to do what she did. This makes me believe even more in my crazy theory.

In episode 5 of season 8. We see Dany telling Jon that Sansa betrayed him. She is painting Sansa as the villain for Jon. (blaming her for Varys' death). What did Jon keep saying this episode and the previous episodes this season? ""She is my queen"" "" You are my queen"" ""You will always be my queen"" .. etc. Let this simmer for a bit.

Now I previously said that Sansa is going to march down on Kingslanding. I still think she will. Now that news of Dany burning the whole city and committing genocide spread, Sansa will absolutely have the support of every person in westeros (Not sure about Yara's part in this yet) against Dany and her armies or what is left of them. The final showdown will be between Stark, Baratheon, Arryn ,(maybe even Tormund, Dorne, the wolves (I KNOW THAT I SOUND CRAZY)) .. etc against the mad queen.... Sounds familiar?

I want to speak about Arya a bit. Almost all of you probably wont agree with this but I still want to share my thoughts. I think this will all revolve around her. She will be the key that solves everything or at least end it. She survived both Ice and Fire. Rose up from the ashes and smoke and made her way out on a horse that bran probably provided? (Just you wait. He's about to get useful lol).

I don't know if that battle will be huge or small and sneaky. I'm going to go with huge since we have a dragon still alive and the dothraki don't have a word for sneaky.  Now if it is an all out war, I think it might end up with bran taking control over Drogon and possibly bring Dany to her executioner, Arya? What I think will happen might be worse. alot worse, and here it goes:

Remember I told you to let a thought simmer earlier. Jon. Jon Jon Jon JON! Honorable, Jon. There will be a war going on between his Queen (I think the whole ""let it be fear"" scene confirmed that is all she is to him) and his family.  He will have to choose, between his word ""you will always be my queen""  and his family. I'm sorry for what I am about to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Jon will make his biggest mistake yet. He is going to stay true to his word. As he always did. (probably the promised biggest plot twist. even thought I hate it and hate that I'm saying it)

S8 E1 foreshadowing,

""I'm her family too""

""Never forget that""

Arya Kills Jon.

Remember all the looks Bran gave to Tyrion? Well, those looks were for a reason. He was looking at the future king slayer. or should I say queen slayer. I think bran knew that Tyrion has a role to play. What better purpose than to save the rest of westeros by killing the woman who want to see it burn.

Who is left? Arya Possibly has a change of heart. (after she decides to leave the life of vengeance. RIP Sandor)  Maybe those two houses will actually finally join. Maybe, a new king and queen, an honorable man and a just woman, will rule the seven kingdoms.

Random thought: Remember in season one when Robert said to Ned ""There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but its coming""? Talk about the shows longest foreshadowing. Ok, I'll stop reaching.

Obviously, there are some loose threads here. Many characters who I have not mentioned. I'm mostly unsure of their role. Like maybe a Brienne Vs Grey Worm fight? (I should really get some sleep)

Well, You have made it to the end. Thank you for reading all this gibberish. I apologize for wasting your time :)I repeat. None of this will probably happen but a ""mad man sees what he sees"".

D&amp;D I believe in you. Even if none of this happens, Thank you for finishing the show. A job most people would have found impossible. I'm absolutely sure everyone who made this show possible gave it their best and every one of them is appreciated. I will miss looking forward to a new season. &lt;3

So Jon does assassinate Dany and is subsequently arrested. He does so because he doesn't want Dany to rule with an iron fist for the next 50 years and he'd rather much die instead. Tyrion or someone else intervenes and gives Jon the option to take the black. The Night's Watch is disbanded and isn't going to be re-organized because the threat from beyond is defeated, so Jon is exiled to the lands beyond the wall instead. Jon is content because he is fed up fighting wars and watching his loved ones die. He leaves, leaving the rest of the cast to sort everything out.

He bids farewell to his family one last time and sets out to find his freefolk friends, to finally live a happy and peaceful life. He passes through the demolished wall, finds Tormund and ghost and assists the few remaining freefolk with rebuilding their old settlements. He remains a ""snow"" for the rest of his life and the Targaryen dynasty ends with him.

The show's final scenes will mirror the first scenes.

Why this theory could be true:

* Melissandre said that the struggle between light and darkness is eternal. 
* We still know very little about the Others, the 3-eyed raven, the elves or why Mel had such potent magic abilities. Is R'hllor real and eternal? If so is the great Other real and eternal as well?  
* Where does Westeros northernmost part end? Why are the seasons in Westeros so inconsistent? Are there any elves still alive or did the NK kill them all?

If this mad queen story was supposed to be the main attraction all along.

Then they could've had a better build up to Dany going ""mad"" and had her defeat Cersei maybe episode 4 or episode 5 of season 7.

We've known this Dany going mad queen was a possibility since the beginning but this just seems forced.  

Jorah really should've died of grayscale also either at the end of season 6 or the beginning of season 7.  

Maybe Dany could've been informed with a raven or something at the beginning of season 7 after she lands on Dragon Stone.  

Then we could've seen the real descent from there.

That would've been the catalyst to really push her over the edge.  

We saw what happened in season 5 when she banishes him.  

She loses control of slavers bay, she loses Yunkai.  

She almost gets overthrown by the slaves because she beheads one of them and causes a huge  riot.  

We can see that without Jorah she really has no ""gentle heart"" because Jorah is her gentle heart.  

Without him she becomes the dragon.  

That would track well in the story they are trying to tell here with her anyway.

Had this been dealt with in season 7 and if we had a few episodes to sell it more I think it would've landed much better.  

Then this season could've been how to either get Dany back to good or overthrow her. 

I just think that would've given the story more time to play out.  

Other than this forced/rushed story line, I liked the episode more than any other so far this season.  

Why didn't the DD's make more episodes?

* She then tells Jon that it is his choice to chance what would happen or to let history runs its course
* We then move on to the scene in episode 4 where Dany and Jon are in Jon's room and Jon decides that as the last Targeryans he can avoid Dany going down that dark path if she isn't left to feel alone. Instead of rejecting her he proposes to her and they get married in secret
* We then move on to the war council scene of episode 4, following Jon to talk to Bran. Arya and Sansa where he decides not to be an innocent idiot and only tells Arya about his true heritage as he knows that Sansa would have her own agenda if she were to know about his true identity. He swears Samwell, Arya and Bran to secrecy as Dany asked him to 
* Dany does lose Missandei and Rhaegal gets injured but the dragon manages to escape to Dragonstone whilst Dany flanks him, leaving her fleet to be attacked by Euron
* We move on to episode 5 and as Tyrion and Varys don't know Jon's heritage Vary's does not plan to spread whispers. However, he is still concerned about Dany's mental state and does try to poison her. A plan Tyrion discovers and tells Dany about Varys' betrayal
* Jon arrives at Dragonstone and Dany is waiting for him at the shore only to tell him about Varys' betrayal and her plan to kill him. Jon reluctantly stands behind his queen
* then the attack of KL proceeds but as the bells ring Dany decides that having Jon's support and the fact that she won't be her father, that she is stronger than people give her credit for she then decides not to burn KL as she won't be queen of the ashes
* Dany proceeds to fly to the Red Keep and burns it to the ground - same scenes we saw
* The Jamie story and Euron arc can finish as it did - idc! 
* Jon follows Dany to the Red Keep with his army whilst the unsullied quelm the rest of rebellion, killing only soldiers and dissidents that resist them

What do you think? Better or worse than D&amp;D?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully better writing than D&amp;amp;D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before Melissande walked off and disappeared into the snow, she walks up to Jon Snow and shows him the events that unfolded in episode 4 and 5 &amp;quot;if a Targeryan is left to be alone&amp;quot; in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She then tells Jon that it is his choice to chance what would happen or to let history runs its course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We then move on to the scene in episode 4 where Dany and Jon are in Jon&amp;#39;s room and Jon decides that as the last Targeryans he can avoid Dany going down that dark path if she isn&amp;#39;t left to feel alone. Instead of rejecting her he proposes to her and they get married in secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We then move on to the war council scene of episode 4, following Jon to talk to Bran. Arya and Sansa where he decides not to be an innocent idiot and only tells Arya about his true heritage as he knows that Sansa would have her own agenda if she were to know about his true identity. He swears Samwell, Arya and Bran to secrecy as Dany asked him to &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany does lose Missandei and Rhaegal gets injured but the dragon manages to escape to Dragonstone whilst Dany flanks him, leaving her fleet to be attacked by Euron&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We move on to episode 5 and as Tyrion and Varys don&amp;#39;t know Jon&amp;#39;s heritage Vary&amp;#39;s does not plan to spread whispers. However, he is still concerned about Dany&amp;#39;s mental state and does try to poison her. A plan Tyrion discovers and tells Dany about Varys&amp;#39; betrayal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon arrives at Dragonstone and Dany is waiting for him at the shore only to tell him about Varys&amp;#39; betrayal and her plan to kill him. Jon reluctantly stands behind his queen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the attack of KL proceeds but as the bells ring Dany decides that having Jon&amp;#39;s support and the fact that she won&amp;#39;t be her father, that she is stronger than people give her credit for she then decides not to burn KL as she won&amp;#39;t be queen of the ashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany proceeds to fly to the Red Keep and burns it to the ground - same scenes we saw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jamie story and Euron arc can finish as it did - idc! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon follows Dany to the Red Keep with his army whilst the unsullied quelm the rest of rebellion, killing only soldiers and dissidents that resist them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get Clegane bowl &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon and Dany capture Cersei and Arya kills Jamie and takes his face &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we enter episode 6 where Cersei gets the punishment she deserves - Arya kills her with Jamie&amp;#39;s face in the most painful way, fulfilling the prophecy that she would die at the hand of her little brother - it&amp;#39;s crueler this way, for Cersei to think Jamie betrayed her! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany burns the Iron Throne and the North under Sansa&amp;#39;s command rebel against Dany &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany and Jon announce Jon&amp;#39;s heritage and their union deciding to rule as the Last Targeryans to quelm descents as people rebel against Dany&amp;#39;s foreign invader rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So the Prince that was promised is the child of Dany and Jon.

He is one of the heads of a ""Three headed dragon"".  (This is where it connects to the theory of  7) The Mother-Daenerys- she is certainly not the face of mercy as we all know, but it is certainly fair to say she is ""the strength of women"" the symbol of the mother is a woman holding a child, The Father- Jon- he is the representative of justice as his uncle was, easy enough, and The Warrior (the Prince) the child of Jon and Daenerys who we haven't met yet. The Warrior is depicted as a person in armor who looks like he is pulling a sword from something. All Targarians, all heads of the same family, and symbolic of what they represent. The child would be born of Ice and Fire, with both Stark and Targarian blood(Not evenly, but Jon has ""more of the North in him""). The child would be the sword pulled from flames( his mother Dany) probably by Jon, Dany will probably die in childbirth just like his mother thereby completing the circle. Yes the Targarian sigil is also a fucking circle, a cycle that never ends like this show has hammered into us. Just because I'm going all in with the symbolism. 

But, Daenerys can't have children right? Well remember what the witch said ""only death pays for life"" Jon has paid the price with death, and because he was destined to wield the lightbringer he was brought back, they are connected in blood and destiny ""fire and ice"".

So how do I know Dany is pregnant? Episode 4, fifteen minutes in Dany toast and says ""To Ary Stark"". The camera purposefully keeps her in the background and shows that she doesn't drink her ale. Sansa the ever observant one turns to her and notices she isn't drinking and walks away looking mad. Dany then smiles triumphant.   


I don't know how the child will be ""born of smoke and salt"" or when, or what threat it will save the world from, but maybe there will be a time skip or this destined child will be born early because magic. It could even be born in Kings Landing which is smoke(burned to a crisp) and salt (on the coast).

I may be wrong, we'll see:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tyrion, Jon and Ser Davos walk through the destroyed city, coming across more burned bodies and atrocities committed by the Northmen, Unsullied and Dothraki. Along with Arya, who also survived, as well as any people of King's Landing not killed, there will be a speech by Daenerys on the steps of the Red Keep. She will probably be stood in front of Drogon, the last symbol of her power, and warn those who cross her of the consequences of betrayal. The Unsullied and Dothraki (who have suddenly multiplied after being destroyed by the Night King), will act as her enforcers, promoting terror in the process. 
2. There will most likely be a scene in the Red Keep/Throne Room where Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon and a few others will discuss her plans for the new world, with no one brave enough to confront her about the destruction of King's Landing. Tyrion will discover what happened to Jaime and Cersei, and finally lose complete faith in Daenerys as a ruler, as well as Jon, who - after witnessing atrocities he fought to avoid - will most likely want to go back North to Winterfell. Daenerys will target Sansa, given she was the one who 'betrayed' her earlier on. She will send Jon back to Winterfell to serve as Warden of the North, commanding him to force Sansa to bend the knee, or 'suffer the fate of all traitors'. 
3. Jon, Arya, Tyrion and Ser Davos return to Winterfell with the last of the Northern troops still loyal to House Stark, and inform everyone of what transpired in King's Landing. Sansa will lecture Jon about how she was right all along, and that a Targaryen can't be trusted. They will most likely hold a council meeting in the great hall, where Sansa declares the North independent from the Seven Kingdoms. Jon will warn her against this, but Sansa is too strong now, and she knows the truth about what Daenerys is capable of. The truth of Jon's identity will come out, as the remaining peoples of Westeros receive Varys' letters, informing them that he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, as Aegon Targaryen VI. 
4. The remaining Starks, and Jon, will talk by the Weirwood Tree. Arya states she wants to kill Daenerys herself, suffering from what she witnessed when running from Drogon's fireblasts in King's Landing, however Jon informs her that she'd never get close enough with Drogon by her side. 
5. In the ruins of King's Landing, within what remains of the Red Keep, Daenerys will learn of the North's resistance, and that the remaining peoples of Westeros have rallied against her upon discovering the existence of Aegon Targaryen VI. Enraged by the betrayal of Tyrion, Sansa, Jon, etc., Daenerys will plan to destroy the last of her enemies once and for all, removing any threats to her rule - namely Jon, who she has fallen out of love with. The remaining Unsullied and Dothraki will accompany Daenerys North to destroy the last of her enemies. 
6. Winterfell learns of Daenerys' march North. With severely depleted forces, Jon knows they can't beat Daenerys, but Sansa will remain stubborn, determined to protect their home from destruction, not about to allow it to suffer the same fate as King's Landing. 
7. Bran talks to Jon alone at night by the Weirwood Tree, revealing the truth about the Night King, and why the Children of the Forest created him. Bran will show Jon a vision of the past, where the Children were facing extinction by the First Men, and in their desperation, created a terrible weapon. Bran reveals that history repeats itself, and that in order to defeat Daenerys, there is only one solution - to create a new Night King. (I'm basing this off the interview D&amp;D did recently where they remained silent on the possible return of the WW/Night King). Jon, realizing what he has to do, to become the very thing he fought to destroy for the betterment of the Seven Kingdoms, similar to what the Children did thousands of years ago. 
8. Jon, Sansa, Tyrion, Arya, etc., discuss the final solution they have to stop Daenerys. (One theory I have is that the ritual to create the new Night King takes place on Dragonstone, and Rhaegal is brought to shore/resurrected, to be used as a weapon to even the odds against Daenerys. I imagine the Night King served the Children for a time after his creation, and rebelled against them when he realized all life, not just Men, must be erased from the world). The creation of the new Night King (Jon) would be a great arc for Jon, seeing as how he fought against the Night King throughout the seasons, looking into the eyes of what he would become when he first encountered the Night King in S5 during the massacre at Hardhome. 
9. Daenerys arrives at Winterfell on the back of Drogon, demanding the lives of those who betrayed her. (She's this far gone in her madness it only makes sense for her to view everyone as her enemies, just like Aerys II). She is confronted by Jon as the new Night King, taking her by surprise on the back of Rhaegal (Undead), concluding in a final Dance of The Dragons, whereby Rhaegal and Drogon kill each other, thus resulting in the extinction of Dragons from the world once more. Jon will then kill Daenerys, plunging his sword through her heart, ending the final conflict. Jon will then travel North to the Lands of Always Winter, as the Wall is rebuilt once more, and the Night's Watch reinstated. This would hold true to the legend of the first Lord Commander of The Night's Watch becoming the first Night King (who was probably also a Stark himself), thus, history repeating itself.
10. **Alternate/Other Idea:** I still think Jon will become the new Night King, and Daenerys may remain in King's Landing as it is rebuilt/or she simply rules as Queen of the Ashes. Jon will return to the city, raising the dead in the process, who proceed to battle with the Unsullied/Dothraki forces. Jon will face off against Drogon/Daenerys, killing the dragon with an Ice Spear, similar to how Viserion was killed. As Daenerys sees her remaining forces destroyed, Jon kills her, resulting in the bittersweet ending. Something may happen with Drogon activating the untouched caches of Wildfire in the city, or by Rhaegal's blue flames, the dragons killing each other being another idea, destroying the entire city and the undead along with it. This would be a grand finale/bittersweet ending. No more Night King, no more Dragons, no more Targaryens. The Seven Kingdoms would return to governing themselves as they did for thousands of years before Aegon's Conquest. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Surviving Character Endings:** 
* Tyrion: The last of House Lannister lives out the rest of his days as a Vintner in Highgarden, along with Bronn as the Lord of Highgarden, renewing their friendship. 
* Arya: Arya will depart from Winterfell, and live with Gendry as the Lady of Storm's End. Her character arc as an assassin has been fulfilled, and she will wish to lead a normal life, renewing the ties between House Stark and House Baratheon. 
* Jon (Night King): Either destroyed when King's Landing is blown up by the remaining caches of Wildfire, or returns to the Land of Always Winter in the far North. 
* Sansa: Resuming her role as the Lady of Winterfell, Sansa will marry and have children of her own, continuing the line of House Stark as Kings of Winter. 
* Bran: (I'm not sure about Bran given the mystery of his true nature). The three-eyed raven will most likely remain in Winterfell, or return North to live amongst the last Children of the Forest, a guardian of the histories of Westeros. 
* Drogon/Daenerys: Drogon will most likely flee to the ruins of Old Valyria upon the death of his mother, giving birth to dragon eggs and maintaining the existence of Dragons in the world, as well as Magic. I would rather see him die fighting a resurrected Rhaegal, creating a last Dance of The Dragons, and ignite the caches of Wildfire beneath King's Landing in the process, killing himself and Rhaegal. Daenerys will be killed by Jon, most likely in the form of a new Night King, though I suspect it will be written as Jon in his normal, human form, killing Daenerys for the betterment of the realm, ergo, a bittersweet ending. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Side-Note*: I'm well aware the writing of S8 has been atrocious, and completely undermines the character arcs that have spanned several seasons, namely Jaime, Cersei, Daenerys and Jon, so the above speculations - given the subpar quality of writing of S8 - are the most realistic I can come up with at this point. Honestly, I'm pretty sure none of this will happen, and it will just be a boring conclusion. Jon kills Daenerys basically being the main plot of the finale, but it would be somewhat redeemable if they extend it over another surprise episode, rather than cramming everything into one, long episode. If anyone has some other suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I'm sure our expectations will be 'subverted' in some not-so-glorious fashion, knowing D&amp;D...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make this as simple as possible, because let&amp;#39;s be honest, all the amazing, creative fan-theories we post here are far better than what D&amp;amp;D could ever hope to come up with, so in a nutshell, judging from the below-poor standard of writing for S8, this is what will most likely happen in Ep. 6, though these don&amp;#39;t take into account the sub-version methods of the &amp;#39;writers&amp;#39;.

With severely depleted forces, Jon knows they can&amp;#39;t beat Daenerys, but Sansa will remain stubborn, determined to protect their home from destruction, not about to allow it to suffer the same fate as King&amp;#39;s Landing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran talks to Jon alone at night by the Weirwood Tree, revealing the truth about the Night King, and why the Children of the Forest created him. Bran will show Jon a vision of the past, where the Children were facing extinction by the First Men, and in their desperation, created a terrible weapon. Bran reveals that history repeats itself, and that in order to defeat Daenerys, there is only one solution - to create a new Night King. (I&amp;#39;m basing this off the interview D&amp;amp;D did recently where they remained silent on the possible return of the WW/Night King). Jon, realizing what he has to do, to become the very thing he fought to destroy for the betterment of the Seven Kingdoms, similar to what the Children did thousands of years ago. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon, Sansa, Tyrion, Arya, etc., discuss the final solution they have to stop Daenerys. (One theory I have is that the ritual to create the new Night King takes place on Dragonstone, and Rhaegal is brought to shore/resurrected, to be used as a weapon to even the odds against Daenerys. I imagine the Night King served the Children for a time after his creation, and rebelled against them when he realized all life, not just Men, must be erased from the world). The creation of the new Night King (Jon) would be a great arc for Jon, seeing as how he fought against the Night King throughout the seasons, looking into the eyes of what he would become when he first encountered the Night King in S5 during the massacre at Hardhome. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daenerys arrives at Winterfell on the back of Drogon, demanding the lives of those who betrayed her. (She&amp;#39;s this far gone in her madness it only makes sense for her to view everyone as her enemies, just like Aerys II). She is confronted by Jon as the new Night King, taking her by surprise on the back of Rhaegal (Undead), concluding in a final Dance of The Dragons, whereby Rhaegal and Drogon kill each other, thus resulting in the extinction of Dragons from the world once more. Jon will then kill Daenerys, plunging his sword through her heart, ending the final conflict. Jon will then travel North to the Lands of Always Winter, as the Wall is rebuilt once more, and the Night&amp;#39;s Watch reinstated. This would hold true to the legend of the first Lord Commander of The Night&amp;#39;s Watch becoming the first Night King (who was probably also a Stark himself), thus, history repeating itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate/Other Idea:&lt;/strong&gt; I still think Jon will become the new Night King, and Daenerys may remain in King&amp;#39;s Landing as it is rebuilt/or she simply rules as Queen of the Ashes. Jon will return to the city, raising the dead in the process, who proceed to battle with the Unsullied/Dothraki forces. Jon will face off against Drogon/Daenerys, killing the dragon with an Ice Spear, similar to how Viserion was killed. As Daenerys sees her remaining forces destroyed, Jon kills her, resulting in the bittersweet ending. Something may happen with Drogon activating the untouched caches of Wildfire in the city, or by Rhaegal&amp;#39;s blue flames, the dragons killing each other being another idea, destroying the entire city and the undead along with it. This would be a grand finale/bittersweet ending. No more Night King, no more Dragons, no more Targaryens. The Seven Kingdoms would return to governing themselves as they did for thousands of years before Aegon&amp;#39;s Conquest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surviving Character Endings:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyrion: The last of House Lannister lives out the rest of his days as a Vintner in Highgarden, along with Bronn as the Lord of Highgarden, renewing their friendship. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arya: Arya will depart from Winterfell, and live with Gendry as the Lady of Storm&amp;#39;s End. Her character arc as an assassin has been fulfilled, and she will wish to lead a normal life, renewing the ties between House Stark and House Baratheon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jon (Night King): Either destroyed when King&amp;#39;s Landing is blown up by the remaining caches of Wildfire, or returns to the Land of Always Winter in the far North. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sansa: Resuming her role as the Lady of Winterfell, Sansa will marry and have children of her own, continuing the line of House Stark as Kings of Winter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran: (I&amp;#39;m not sure about Bran given the mystery of his true nature). The three-eyed raven will most likely remain in Winterfell, or return North to live amongst the last Children of the Forest, a guardian of the histories of Westeros. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drogon/Daenerys: Drogon will most likely flee to the ruins of Old Valyria upon the death of his mother, giving birth to dragon eggs and maintaining the existence of Dragons in the world, as well as Magic. I would rather see him die fighting a resurrected Rhaegal, creating a last Dance of The Dragons, and ignite the caches of Wildfire beneath King&amp;#39;s Landing in the process, killing himself and Rhaegal. Daenerys will be killed by Jon, most likely in the form of a new Night King, though I suspect it will be written as Jon in his normal, human form, killing Daenerys for the betterment of the realm, ergo, a bittersweet ending. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side-Note&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;#39;m well aware the writing of S8 has been atrocious, and completely undermines the character arcs that have spanned several seasons, namely Jaime, Cersei, Daenerys and Jon, so the above speculations - given the subpar quality of writing of S8 - are the most realistic I can come up with at this point. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure none of this will happen, and it will just be a boring conclusion. Jon kills Daenerys basically being the main plot of the finale, but it would be somewhat redeemable if they extend it over another surprise episode, rather than cramming everything into one, long episode. If anyone has some other suggestions, I&amp;#39;d love to hear them. I&amp;#39;m sure our expectations will be &amp;#39;subverted&amp;#39; in some not-so-glorious fashion, knowing D&amp;amp;D...&lt;/p&gt;

20 years ago the death of Lyanna Stark and the atrocities of Aerys Targaryen resulted in Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon going to war, defeating the Targaryen armies, Jaime Lannister stabbing Aerys in the back in the throne room and clearing the way for Robert Baratheon to take the throne.


Now replace Lyanna Stark with Sansa Stark, Aerys with Danaerys (his daughter), Ned Stark with Jon Stark (his step-son), Robert with Gendry (His son) and Jaime with Tyrion (his brother)


Sansa stark has been marked for death by Danaerys, who told Jon that Sansa has betrayed them. Just like Varys did. The finale will open with Danaerys executing Sansa, inflaming the north and Jon against her.


Jon will request the help of gendry who will bring the armies of storms end and the riverlands to fight, much like Ned and Robert did many decades ago, realising the mad queen needs to be overthrown.


Meanwhile, Tyrion has been perfectly set up to be very on the fence about his loyalty, and deep down he knows he was wrong and in bringing her here, is partly responsible. He will kill her by stabbing her in the throne room, ending her reign and becoming the new kingslayer.


Jon does not want the throne and Gendry as Roberts last surviving heir is next in line for the throne based on the Baratheon succession, with Stannis and Renly dead. He will ascend. Jon will return north as Warden of the north.


History repeats.


It also works if you switch Sansa and Jon so the genetic parentage pattern holds. Lyanna is mother to Jon so perhaps Jon will be executed at the opening of episode 6, then Sansa (Ned starks biological daughter) will join with Gendry to fight the war, and go back North to become warden(ess) of the North.


And if that's not enough to get you excited, what about Arya? She just had a character life changing scene where she turned from a life of death and revenge and came back to her humanity. She then left on a horse. Why? Where is she going? What was the last thing to happen to her on a personal level? That's right, Gendry proposed. She is going to accept his offer. When Gendry joins the fight against Danaerys, Arya will be at her side (and will probably kill the dragon). And if Arya is with Gendry..... Arya will be queen!

I think that after S8E5 with Dany becoming the mad queen, she will continue with her madness and send her remaining forces back North to kill Sansa.

The show will end with Jon representing Ice and Dany representing Fire... and there maybe be a pack between Jon and Dany not to continue killing people due to the fact that Dany might be pregnant with Jon's kid. They rebuild the wall.. to separate living from dead.

Sam tells the story to his own kid (maybe Jon's kid as well) and closes the book. End of the story.

Also the words he used at the end I‚Äôd like to think this means he &lt;em&gt;hopes&lt;/em&gt; his mission is successful in poisoning and killing Dany saving the realm from such a ruler and that way he would definitely deserve that death for being the one responsible&lt;/p&gt;

First, the Lightbringer story behind the prophecy:

&gt;Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to **temper it in water**, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, **he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart**, but once more the steel **shattered**. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, **her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer**, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon.

Now, with that being a story, I don't believe it's to be taken word for word. The prophesy, however, is:

&gt;It has been foretold in the books at Asshai that when the stars bleed and the cold winds blow, a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. That sword will be Lightbringer. The one who draws it will be Azor Ahai reborn.

I'm less sure about this interpretation, but to me we can also interpret ""draw"" as drawing a person to you. In Melisandre's visions, Arya fled to her brother Jon. One could say Jon's living weapon of a sister was drawn to him out of the fires. Stretch? Maybe. But let me go on.

I do believe Jon to be the Azor Ahai (though I have definitely considered Tyrion the Targaryen). He awakened the dragons at Dragonstone when he was Dany's last hope but could not return her affections, and she switched over to Mad Queen. (As quoted before the episode began, her brother used to always warn her not to wake the dragons in him.)

So anyway, about those three hero's weapons. Here are my current thoughts:

1. Needle, the weapon Jon gave her. She used it while learning **water** dancing. It wasn't so great against armored people, though.
2. Valyrian steel dagger (Catspaw). Her second hero's weapon. She used it to **shatter** the Night King.
3. The custom weapon she had Gendry make her. You know, Chekov's spear. It has a tip of dragon glass, and is also meant to break in two. Seems pretty well rounded and perfect for her. And we haven't TRULY seen her use it.

But to create Lightbringer, Arya's soul must combine with the steel. **This sounds so much like how you make white walkers.** With the help of Bran, Jon will likely make a hard choice: driving the dragonglass of the spear into Arya's heart.

And then she will be the Night Queen, and they will raise the dead and head south. See my post here for how I came to that particular theory: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bof6a6/melisandres\_visions\_were\_right\_arya\_fleeing\_on\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bof6a6/melisandres_visions_were_right_arya_fleeing_on_a/)

\---------------------------------------------

**Edit:**

Thinking about this more, along the same lines of how I think she herself is Lightbringer, I think she herself could still be the hero's weapon all three times. The events I listed could be the same, tied in with the same weapons she used, but rather than those being the hero's weapons, it could just all be her. She is Jon's weapon to defeat evil, first forged by him giving her Needle. 

To revise my list accordingly:

1. Tempered by **water (dancing)**, but she broke. It was good but wasn't enough. 
2. Then she became the skilled assassin we've known through so much of the show and killed the captured lion (""captured"" actually conflicts with my Night King theories, so I'm not certain anymore who this is, unless it just means because Jon thinks he was captured?), but she still **shattered in King's Landing as she was overwhelmed by all the fire and death**. Here I'm potentially connecting the ""**crumbled and blew away**"" from Melisandre's prophesy. 
3. Then Jon will turn her into a white walker, most likely to **save her life in the same way that Benjen's life was saved.** I feel like that was important foreshadowing, and she breathed in way too much ash to live much longer. So he will plunge dragonglass into her (could just be with his own sword, or the dagger, or her new weapon), and that is *finally* Arya as the ultimate weapon and Lightbringer. And Arya will use her spear thing that Gendry made her to kill Dany and/or Drogon. (Does Drogon have green eyes? He is greenish... hmm. If so, it could be yet another switcharoo, and that she only kills Drogon with her awesome dragon-killing spear, and it's still up for grabs who kills Dany.)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Yes, I could definitely be wrong.

As many of you, Ive been feeling that the holes in the plot are tearing down the spirit of the series. There are too many coincidences and sudden events that are not logic. From the military strategy in Winterfell to the way Dany becomes the Mad Queen. At first sight these events, among others, have turned the episodes into something very hard to believe. But what if these events were not sudden at all? what if they all had a purpose? what if they were just part of a huge Machiavellian plan?

Let's go with the acts that seem not to have an explanation

1 the arrival of Melisandre to Winterfell - how can she come from the north? She was at Essos so she should have come from the south, there are more ports at the south of Winterfell than in the north. But the most surprising thing is that it seems that she had to pass through the army of the death. How could she? 

2 the night's king behavior - the two appearances he had in other seasons interacting with humans happened differently. He never came close, he sent the death ones the white walkers to the fight. But it seems that at Winterfell he felt like he had to have a major role in the battle. He never acts until he sees Bran in the shape of a Raven tho. Why? 
Although you might think that the strategy of the army of the living was disastrous, you may want to consider that it looked that way because the strategy of the night's king was perfect. It looked like he already knew what was going to happen. Is he a great military or did someone tell him what to do? There were a few people in the headquarters of Winterfell when the strategy was designed

3 Melisandre's good luck - when Arya is running away from the death soldiers in Winterfell she faces Melisandre in a room full of corpses. The more I think the less I can understand how she survived to that scenario. I mean the only explanation is that the number of death soldiers was equal to the living ones and at some point they neutralized each other at the same time and Melisandre was the only survivor or the most likely explanation is that the death soldiers won (you cannot see too many rotten corpses in the floor) and they just went to a different room leaving Melisandre alone, but why?

4 once Melisandre tells Arya the prophecy of the blue eyes it looks like she walks to a window. The next scene we see her is when she's jumping to the night's king. But wait a minute, how did she got there? By climbing over the roofs of the buildings? Shouldn't that be a very difficult enterprise due to the complexity of the castle? The books say that there was one guy who knew all about that. I can't remember his name tho

5 the weapon of choice, but who chose it? Who chose it to belong to Arya? Oh yeah, the same guy who knows all about climbing in Winterfell

You see where I'm going, right? Am I crazy? Yeah maybe I'm hearing the same voices that drove Aerys mad, which by the way.... JK (or not) let's continue  

In episode 5

6 when Dany faces Tyron at the beginning of the episode she already knows everything, who told her? None else was aware of all the details... Except for the guy who sees it all. She even helped to eat, was she also aware of Varys' attempt to poison her? 

7 unlike the strategy in Winterfell, now Dany seems to know all about Cersei's plans. The location of the golden company (not that hard but still) and the scorpions. Not only that but she planned to attack on a specific time of the day, did she know that the clouds would be helpful to avoid the iron fleet to aim at Drogo?

8 the madness. Oh the sweet madness, that moment when your demons get wild and take over control. I was like WTF Dany, stop it, but you already know how it feels. Anyway, I noticed that after the bells' ring Dany starts flying to the red kept, but in the middle of the trip she starts to Dracarys the hell out of the people and during all this period of savageness we cannot see her face, why? Was it a budget problem? Did they run out of Emilia's on scene minutes? I think that the colour of her eyes could have changed from Green to... I don't know, white perhaps? In addition to this, there was valiryan fire explosions everywhere so most likely Cersei was going to be Cersei and fire everything up. Did Dany anticipate this and decided to save the time and the lives of her army? Both scenarios lead me to one crippled guy who could have told her what was going to happen  (justlikehedidtoaerys cof cof) or ""warged"" her

Anyway, my hope is that all these events are connected through our Lord of Winterfell and that way this madness that has been the 8th season gets some sense

&gt;A face took shape within the hearth. Stannis? she thought, for just a moment ... but no, these were not his features. A wooden face, corpse white. Was this the enemy? A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames. He sees me. Beside him, **a boy with a wolfs face** threw back his head and howled.

Very curious here. The ""he sees me"" part makes me think it's Bran. Beside him, Jon. A thousand red eyes could be them raising the dead in the North.

&gt;**Snowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them**, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and **dead things shambled silent through the cold**, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained.

Winter coming south as the new Night Queen (Arya) brings them all down? (This theory will be written out in a separate post.)

&gt;The flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name Jon Snow. His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a shadow half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. **Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.** But the skulls were here as well, the skulls were all around him. Melisandre had seen his danger before, had tried to warn the boy of it. Enemies all around him, daggers in the dark. He would not listen.

Maybe Dany is whispering this name. And meanwhile, Jon does cool Ghost warg things. (!!!) The skulls are all the people Dany had killed in the city.

I'm pretty excited about episode 6. 

\-------------

And let me add this, regarding the pale horse. In *A* *Dance with Dragons*, Quaithe says to Dany:

&gt;The glass candles are burning. **Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others.** Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.

The pale mare (Arya) is leading the others. The perfumed seneschal is likely Varys. ""Undying"" could be the vision she had in the House of the Undying. But I'm not sure who the others are. Perhaps Northern lords responding to Varys' notes that got out before he was caught. Maybe Yara is the Kraken, etc. It's from the book, so it might not be exact. Even so. It seems plausible to me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dany destroying everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;strong&gt;the towers by the sea, crumbling&lt;/strong&gt; as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths. Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. &lt;strong&gt;Through curtains of fire great winged shadows&lt;/strong&gt; wheeled against a hard blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya fleeing the city on a pale horse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl. I must find the girl again, &lt;strong&gt;the grey girl on the dying horse&lt;/strong&gt;. Jon Snow would expect that of her, and soon. It would not be enough to say &lt;strong&gt;the girl was fleeing&lt;/strong&gt;. He would want more, he would want the when and where, and she did not have that for him. She had seen the girl only once. &lt;strong&gt;A girl as grey as ash&lt;/strong&gt;, and even as I watched she crumbled and blew away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe girl,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA girl in grey on a dying horse. Jon Snow‚Äôs sister.‚Äù Who else could it be? &lt;em&gt;She was racing to him for protection, that much Melisandre had seen clearly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jon Snow seats himself to the Iron Throne; he then exiles Danny.  Danny decides to go back to Meereen and to rule the cities around Slaver's bay.

Bran has become the Night King after the Long Night. He watched and felt the power of Valyrian steel, and became no fear of it. That was the reason why the old Night King died so easily - he scarified himself to give the new King of chance of fixing the flaw of Night Kings.

Sansa calls all people in the North to the castle to celebrate the conquer of King's Landing. Bran slaughters all the people in the ceremony. Sansa had a last conversation with him which reveals many stories:

1. Bran sent his ravens to help Euron for surveillance, that was why Euron was able to  ambush the dragon.
2. Bran told Sansa that he saw in his prophesy that the daughter of the Mad King burns King's Landing and kills all the people. He convinced Sansa that only Jon Snow can be a good King.
3. Sansa then leaked the secret about Jon's bloodline; and tried to form an union against Danny. Jon knows nothing about it.

Bran resurrected dragon Rhaegal. He, with dragon Ice Rhaegal, then leads his army south. No one is able to defeat him. Too many people have died in the wars.

Bran's army surrounds King's Landing. Jon's army is not able to resist White Walkers from entering the city. Jon is killed at the throne. He missed Danny and regretted for having exiled her before his death.

Araya, who is not aware about the factor that Night King is now no fear of Valyrian steel, tried to assassinate Bran. She stabbed her dagger into Bran's body but didn't kill him. She was able to flee and bring the message to Danny who was in Pentos at that time.

The entire continent of Westeros fell under the rule of the Night King. Danny flies back to King's Landing alone on her dragon only to see Jon's eyes are blue. She cries out ""no!"" and returns to Pentos after realizing she can do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the end of Game of Thrones. At the end, it has a teaser campaign that says the story will be continued in a new drama named ""A song of Ice of Fire"", in which Danny will conquer the entire Essos and will lead the East/Fire continent to fight against the West/Ice continent.

In an [interview with the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-night-king-isaac-hempstead-wright.html), Isaac Hempstead Wright gives as in-depth a look on Bran as we have seen. 
 
He presents Bran as the Three-Eyed Raven, a being that knows and lives in the past and even sees glimpses into the future.  He does not tell others what he knows as this ‚Äúwould affect the outcome‚Äù and is aware things must ‚Äúunfold naturally‚Äù. This persona is solidified in the interview when IHW labels the 3ER as ‚Äúan indifferent keeper of history and time‚Äù and that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt sit there judging. He doesn‚Äôt sit there advising. He just sits there keeping an eye on history and time.‚Äù

So, Bran is a shitty plot device that is used as a video player for the viewers. Disappointing, but understandable given how these past two seasons have gone.

**But here‚Äôs where this idea breaks down**

Far from being a passive knowledge repository, Bran has been directly involved and ultimately responsible for every single significant event since he has become the Three-Eyed Raven. 

His visions were used to provide the evidence that convicted Littlefinger.

He gave Arya the Catspaw dagger

IHW, in the same interview above, let slip that [Bran manipulated Theon to charge the NK](https://i.imgur.com/61sEE89.png) to buy the additional few seconds needed for Arya

And, the big one, Jon‚Äôs parentage reveal which ultimately led to the events of the last episode.

So no, the 3ER has not been there to passively record history and time and let events unfold ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù. Far from it, in fact. The future is as he has seen **entirely because of the actions of the 3ER**.

This begs the question: why? Why this outcome? Does the 3ER have a motive or ‚Äúwant‚Äù? If he truly does not, is the 3ER a tool of an entity that does?

I don‚Äôt believe we will get all of the answers to these questions in the final episode, but I do think we will see Bran/3ER as the puppet master behind everything that has occurred in this series. 

This will set up a rich and intriguing environment for the prequels, or as Martin calls them, ""successor show"", as he says ‚Äúthey are not Game of Thrones spin-offs in the traditional sense.‚Äù","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistencies and incongruities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jon and Dany are face to face, fighting about/over the throne, Jon is faced with the decision to kill the one he ""loves"" or do his duty, but out of nowhere Arya kills Dany...... I thought of this theory because it ties back to Ygritte being killed at the attack on Castle Black.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Ygritte goes to the waterfall with Jon, says they should stay forever, hesitates in battle and is killed by a bystander.

2) Daenerys goes to the waterfall with Jon, says they should stay forever, obviously has been very hesitant with Jon recently and tried to act on love in the start of the last episode, could she actually love him so much that it be her end?

#1 I think Cersei death scene was okay for her character. I know people have been complaining but most monstrous dictators don‚Äôt die the same way as how they have killed others. I accept that for her character.

#2 I would have rather seen Jaime go out in battle like a hero with his sword rather than with Cersei and the rocks.

#3 I understand Dany‚Äôs character becoming mad. She has been the generous, gentle heart queen for so long that she has reached her MAX. Olenna told her if she was a dragon and to be a dragon. Since the season is ending in a few short episodes they had to rush her personality change. It would have been nice to see her gradually change over time. 

#4 I wish Dany and Jon‚Äôs relationship had started sooner in the series. We have only seen 2 episodes of them as a real couple. Since he learned the news he still cares for her but he keeps his distance and I miss the interaction despite the fact of them actually being related. 

#5 It was time for Varys to go him and littlefinger had been manipulating and betraying since day 1. She warned him before about betraying her and he didnt listen. I am okay with how he died.

#6 I loved Tyrion‚Äôs last talk with Jaime and freeing him. The Lannisters were evil people since day 1 but if anyone noticed they have repeatedly stuck together as a family. Blood was always thicker than water.

She chose to rule this side of the sea by fear, so be it.  Varys sent off all those letters, and Dany isn't stupid so she knows the lords of Westeros will begin plotting as a result.  This means Jon (her presumed replacement) needs to be dealt with.

I suspect she torched King's Landing partly because she was was angry, and partly because a peaceful transition would have meant that the lords of Westeros would still feel free to plot away behind her back.  Torching the city sends a very clear message not to f\*ck with the Queen of Dragons, and likely adds quite a bit of hesitation to any of the plotting in the lords Varys contacted.  However, the word is out there.  Jon is the legitimate heir, not her.  As long as Jon lives, her reign is in jeopardy.

Tyrion will get arrested for betraying Dany because he freed Jaime.  Jon will also (probably) get arrested for the same reason Dany gave this last episode, that he told his family his true heritage against her wishes (betrayed for love of family).  Now since Jon is a Targaryen, she'll be hesitant to kill Jon with dragon fire.  His being a rumored Targaryen means that if he does not in fact burn when Drogon roasts him, she'll have proven concretely his claim to the throne and de-legitimized her own at the same time.  She'll order Jon beheaded instead (and they'll state the same reasoning for the viewers' benefit).  Tyrion, on the other hand, is not even remotely suspected of being a Targaryen despite all the evidence in the books of him being the son of the Mad King.  Dany will roast him with dragon fire, the same way she did Varys without thinking about it.  However, what if Tyrion is alive and well after the roasting?  His heritage will be proven right then and there.  Dany would be dumbstruck, and would now have 2 problem people to deal with.

If Tyrion is revealed to be a Targaryen, Jon would back him for being King.  Jon doesn't want to be king, but it isn't in his character to run away and shirk his duty.  However, with another capable heir, Jon would happily step aside to wallow in self-pity and roam the North again with Ghost.  Having said all this Dany isn't going to step aside peacefully, so I suspect Arya (or Jon) will kill her.  After all, if Jon's an enemy, Winterfell and Sansa are definitely next on her to-kill list as they wouldn't sit back peacefully and let another cousin / brother Stark die in King's Landing without consequence.  So Dany has to die.  Tyrion will become king, and weds Sansa to secure the North, done.  Peace-ish time again for Westeros.

**Short Version:**  Daenerys tries to roast Tyrion with dragon fire, it fails.  Dany gets made dead.  Jon points to Tyrion and says ""you be king"".  Tyrion weds Sansa.  Jon goes back to the North to find Ghost and roam.

&amp;#x200B;

She is much more analogous to a darker, female Jesus Christ, what are you going to do if Jesus decided to come fly down on a dragon and destroy your city? Absolutely nothing, he‚Äôs fucking Jesus! As such, even questioning his actions is considered sacrilegious to him.

The problem with trying to attempt to rationalize Dany is that we‚Äôre all pathetic little humans compared to her.

After we survey the aftermath of Dany's destruction of the capital, we will see the cracks widen in Dany's ever-increasingly small circle of friends. She is now feared by everyone, including Tyrion and Jon. Tyrion stays by her side (for now) because he has no other real choice. Jon talks to Davos and they leave town and return North with their armies. Grey Worm stays by Dany because they both have blood on their hands that can never be washed away. Meanwhile the Iron Throne lies at the bottom of a mountain of rubble.
2. Speaking of heading North. With Cersei dead, Dany decides it's time to head back to Winterfell to confront Sansa, who she despises more than any other living Westerosi. The North is where the final ""battle"" takes place. 
3. The ""battle"" will not be between armies. There may be some soldiers who fight, but this will be an intimate fight between the remaining main characters. 
4. This is the battle for who survives and whether *anyone* will be ruling a united Seven Kingdoms. There are a few possibilities for how this concludes. Jon might kill Dany, either as an open rival to her, or as a betrayer after maintaining his rocky allegiance to her. Arya might assassinate her (with Grey Worm's face?), although I would be surprised if the show allows her to kill both the Night King and the Mad Queen. Tyrion might also be the one. It could be a subtle slaying, like when he strangled Shae with her necklace. Or it could even be Brienne. I don't think it will be Sansa directly, though she could pull off some Littlefinger magic and scheme for her demise. If Dany remembers that she has a conscience, she could even put a dagger through her own heart. Of course, she could also kill everyone else and cement her queendom (but I don't think that's likely). Since the series of books is called A Song of Ice and Fire, presumably a reference to Jon and Dany, I think the final battle will be between these two. Right now, I think they both kill each other. 
5. If Dany dies, Drogon must die. I find it hard to believe he would just happily fly off into the sunset. I don't think anyone will directly kill him. I'm not sure anyone has the means to do it. If Jon survives, maybe he takes possession of Drogon since he is a Targaryen, though I think Drogon is too fiercely loyal to Dany. Maybe Bran wargs into Drogon and flies him into the bottom of the ocean (if this happens, though, then why didn't Bran warg into the Night King's dragon?).
6. If Dany dies and Jon survives, he could rule over the Seven Kingdoms. But, who in their right mind wants anyone of Targaryen heritage ruling over the masses? This being the case, Jon might head north of the Wall and live among the freefolk. He would abdicate his right to the throne and leave a true Stark, Sansa, to rule the North. The other kingdoms would self-rule. There would be no more united Seven Kingdoms, at least not on this show. Even if Jon and Dany both die, none of the Starks have a claim to the Iron Throne, and none of them want it anyway. I'm finding it harder and harder to see any of the surviving characters ruling over the Seven Kingdoms, unless Dany kills everyone and lives out her dream as queen. 
7. Bronn. Not sure what happens to him. If Tyrion ends up being the last man standing, he might try to give some big castle to Bronn, but I think the Seven Kingdoms are in such shambles, and Tyrion's power will be so completely diminished in the end, what can he give Bronn? Lastly, I don't think Tyrion will sit the Iron Throne, as some have hoped. Who would want him? He has guilt by association with Dany.
8. In the final minutes of the episode, we see Sam at the Citadel writing the story of A Song of Ice and Fire. Gilly will be by his side. This will be the ""happy"" conclusion to the story. 
9. But just before the credits roll, the show flies way, way north of the wall, over mountains and ravines, past frozen lakes, and deep into a cavern of ice. After a pause to peer into the darkness, two blue eyes flash open...and then the screen goes to black.

I really thought Grey Worm was going to fight Jon last night- the look he gave him when he heard him tell the Northerers to fall back...yikes!

Moving on, having thought about Dany's character arc with the idea that she may become a villain by the end, I offer a new interpretation of the 'three treasons you will know' prophecy from the House of the Undying. We know that prophecy is deliberately vague and often misinterpreted by the characters (something GRRM goes out of his way to caution about through characters like Marwyn), and I think Dany has misinterpreted this particular one entirely. The other two prophecies (mounts to ride, fires to light) are ones that she is clearly prophesied to perform herself. The treason prophecy is actually ambiguous (e.g. 'three treasons you will know' rather than 'three treasons you will suffer'). Dany assumes it means three people will commit treason against her, but I suggest that she will be the one to commit three treasons. For example, Viserys' death (even though he deserved it), could be considered a treason as he was her king. This would fit either the treason for love (Drogo) or gold (given the way Viserys dies). 


In the books, Dany believes she has experienced two treasons already (Jorah &amp; Mirri). I predict that if she is destined to descend into madness, then in growing paranoia she may suspect Jon of preparing to commit the final treason (for love - his family?) against her. Consider how she has responded to learning about his true identity in the show, and look particularly at her reaction at the feast in S8E4 where she sees the Stark loyalists celebrating together while she sits alone at her table, clearly feeling like an outsider commanding dubious loyalty. I predict that as she becomes more paranoid, she will convince herself that Jon is going to turn against her and that she will therefore move against him to try to thwart the prophecy. The irony being, in moving against him - her rightful king - *she* will be committing her final treason against *him*. This would be a neat case of a character completely misunderstanding a prophecy and inadvertently bringing it to pass precisely because they are trying to avoid it. Similar devices have been predicted for Cersei's prophecies from Maggy the Frog - in moving against Margaery, she may inadvertently be setting up her own downfall.


Which treasons count as love/gold/blood is harder to predict and may only be possible with context once (if) the final books come out.

Aemon Targaryen was the third son of the fourth son of the king when he was born. Aemon was so far down the line that he became a Maester. Destiny would have a different path for him and eventually the throne would fall at his feet. His father, brothers, cousins and uncles had all died. Remarkably Aemon passed the throne to his younger brother Aegon V. To protect his brother from plots Aemon joined the Night's Watch along with Targaryen bastard - Brynden Rivers aka The Three-Eyed Raven.

NB: This would have serious consequences. It gave the Baratheons a claim on the Throne through marriage to Aegon V's daughter. 

Further catastrophe would strike Aegon V as he and his eldest son, who gave up his right to the throne for love (more on that later), died in a fire. This brought the Mad King's father to the throne. He brought back the brother-sister marriage and forced it upon his son (Mad King) and daughter after hearing the prophecy that the 'prince that was promised' would be born of their line. That prophecy was brought to the king by none of than the woman his elder brother gave up the throne for.

In the next generation Rhaegar would elope with Lyanna and spark Robert's rebellion. Rhaegar also named both his living sons Aegon.

Returning to Aemon, who is constant contact with the Three-Eyed Raven, at the wall he meets Jon Snow and teaches him a valuable lesson that Love is the death of Duty. 

Or from the books the full quote is, ""Love is the bane of honor, the death of duty. What is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms ... or the memory of a brother's smile?""

'Honor compared to a woman's love?' - A reference to Aegon V eldest son giving up the throne for love.

'What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms' - A reference to Rhaegar eloping with Lyanna to conceive Jon.

'or the memory of a brother's smile?""' - A reference to Aemon passing the throne to his brother and then joining the Night's Watch - never to see him again as his house and heir are all but destroyed.

My theory is that the Three-Eyed Raven, Bloodraven not Bran, conspired to make all these events come true. Aemon had knowledge of this and choose to make the dutiful sacrifice and spark the events that would ruin House Targaryen BUT lead to the death of the Night King. The remaining Targaryen's chose love and it led to their ruin.

This is why Maester Aemon insists on teaching Jon that duty must come before love. Aemon was preparing Jon for his sacrifice: killing Dany and becoming Aegon VI.

It fits well with the others. Jon gave up his love (Ygritte and potentially also Dany) where past Targaryen's didn't. Jon gave up the Night's Watch and returned to Winterfell to see his 'brother'. Also when beyond the Wall Jon has the option of staying with Ygritte but chooses to return to the Night's Watch and to 'father no children'. In a sense he choose not to have his family and gave up having newborns.

The Three-Eyen Raven and Aemon have conspired to reach this moment. The Night King is defeated but Dany's threat remains. To completely end the chaos Jon must choose his birthright to the Iron Throne - his duty - even though he doesn't want it over his love for Dany.

I'm so disappointed with the show that I decided to rewrite this whole season to see how better things could've been with a little effort and passion. It might be a long read but I promise it'll be worth your time. I present you,

\## **The season that was promised**

The first two episodes will happen as it is, since they were almost perfect. Except in episode 2, there's one change. Bronn reaches winterfell before the battle. He makes the deal with Tyrion. And Tyrion asks for his help in the battle, but Bronn says he doesn't want to fight anymore.

\## **The Battle of Winterfell**

Everything will go similar as the episode with a few exceptions.  
\- Tyrion isn't in the crypt. He's up watching the battle from a good vantage point.  
\- Unsullied are on the front since the main focus is defence. Dothraki in the back.  
\- Arya is nowhere to be seen.  
\- Ghost hasn't made an appearance.  
\- Jon fights Viserion with Rhaegal and brings it down after a fierce battle.  
\- Dany is busy roasting the dead.  
\- Everything is futile in the end. Battle is almost lost.  
\- NK makes it to Bran. He kills Theon. Bran, NK have their staring contest. NK approaches to kill Bran. But to his surprise, the crippled Bran jumps catching him off guard stabbing him with the Valerian dagger. NK shatters, the dead fall. It is revealed that Arya was disguised as Bran.  
\- Episode ends. Jorah isn't dead.  
\- Melissandre isn't dead.  
\- 60% of the unsullied, 40% of the Dothraki are dead.

\## **The Upcoming events**

\- There's a flashback scene of Tyrion, Bran, Arya in deep discussion. Arya isn't happy with Bran being the bait. She insists to do it on his behalf, but Bran tells her NK can track him as long as he has his mark on his skin.  
\- Since Bran knows about Arya, he suggests he could give her the part of his skin with NK's mark.  
\- It is also revealed that Arya doesn't have to kill someone to take their face. There is face magic involved and she has to make the face.  
\- Tyrion requests Bronn to take Bran away from the battle and keep him safe in case the NK plan fails. He makes an extra deal offering more money.  
\- Only Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Bronn were aware of these plans while everyone else thought Bran was at the tree.  
\- At the place where NK was stabbed, the camera zooms in to show a piece of dragon glass glowing. The Dragon Glass that was stuck into a human by the children of the forest. The glass floats up in the air, forming ice, and the NK is back! His conciousness was inside the Dragon glass all along, and that is the source of him!  
\- Bronn is riding a chariot taking Bran away, while Bran is warging watching the Battle of Winterfell. He sees Night King get shattered. He opens his eyes and tells Bronn to turn back, and that it isn't over. The Night King isn't dead and everyone are in danger. Bronn disagrees. He doesn't want to risk Bran's life and lose the money Tyrion promised him.  
\- The dead start waking up, so does Viserion. Everyone are caught off guard. Arya is cornered by suddenly resurrected white walkers. The NK is staring at her, while one of the white walkers is proceeding to kill her.  
\- The White walker is caught off guard by a wolf! It's Nymeria! Hundreds of wolves start attacking the white walkers and the dead. Nymeria has brought every wolf in the North to their rescue.  
\- Ghost has arrived to help Jon out of a bind too. Both Jon and Arya are overjoyed to see their wolves. There's a sweet reunion amidist the chaos.  
\- Tyrion and Sansa already had arranged for plan B to save as many people as possible planning for a getaway.  
\- Everyone retreats. Some on Dragons, some on chariots, some on horses.  
\- The wolves help in holding back the dead.  
\- Some others who stay back are, Tormund, Greyworm along with a few unsullied and serve as distractions.  
\- Jon wants to stay but Dany insists it is wise to retreat and make a proper plan. Greyworm's death is seen by Dany and Missandae while flying away on the Dragon. Missandae bursts into tears and Dany is angry, sad.  
\- As they are retreating, Tyrion is on Rhaegal with Jon Snow. There's a flashback scene where Tyrion is having trouble processing the conversation he had with Bran in episode 2, right after they make their plans with Arya, and Bronn. When they were alone, Tyrion asks Bran about the things he's seen. Bran touches Tyrion's hand, and uses magic to show him a few key events.

\## **Things Tyrion sees in the flashback**

\- Bran and NK are both stuck in a time loop. The loop started this way, in the first timeline, there was no wall. There was only the post apocalyptic westeros, where the living were hunted down. People lived in fear, hiding from the Wights and the Walkers. In this timeline, Bran isn't crippled. He's a warg, and he hones his skills to defeat NK and put an end to the Long Night. There's a final showdown between Bran and NK. When he is almost killed by NK Bran uses his warging to jump back in time into the body of a random guy and builds the wall, becoming Bran the Builder.  
\- NK is the God of Death resurrected by the children of the forest by using a spell and sacrificing a human. They didn't 'create' him. They only thought they did, and they realized they fucked up when he started trying to massacre every living thing. So, timeline resets when Bran jumps back, but not for NK. He has memories intact since he's a God. Bran upon reaching old age, decides to preserve himself in the WW tree(weirwood tree) using an ancient spell involving ravens, to pass on knowledge to the next Bran. But NK always knows when there's a reset. But when Bran is in the WW tree, NK has no way of entering and killing him. So he waits for thousands of years for WW Bran(weirwood Bran) to come out. Then came new Bran to WW Bran, and transferred his memories to him.  
\- When this happens, NK starts to make a move. The Wall contains magic and no undead can pass it. That's why NK waits for the winter, for the seas to freeze so he can walk around the wall. NK wins, Bran jumps back, both try to change things, repeat.  
\- When Bran made a certain change, it would have certain outcomes. He will have to keep making those changes in every timeline to have a better grip over the outcomes.  
\- One of such change was, warging into the Targeryan King and telling him to 'Burn them all' meaning burn the white walkers. But like how Hodor lost his mind when Bran warged into his past, the king lost his mind and became The Mad King.  
\- The last timeline was very similar to this one. Past Bran secures the Dragon eggs to use them in future. He can't predict what the changed events outcome will be. He only knows the patterns of the previous timeline, outcomes. So he technically doesn't know everything. The eggs end up with Dany. But she had no reason to come to the North. She got to King's Landing, destroyed Cersei. NK walked across the seas, came for Bran. Reset timeline.  
\- Like the God of Death, the Lord of light can't be resurrected. Many have tried and failed. Bran uses his knowledge on ancient magic to form a bridge or connection between the world and the Lord of light. Hence the Lord has limited influence over the world.  
\- Some present timeline changes are, WW Bran seeks the help from Lord of the Light. That leads to Jon staying alive, and some other resurrections. Jon brings Dany to the North. WW Bran accidently gets new Bran marked by NK. This disables the magic on the wall.  
\- NK having knowledge of the previous timeline, uses it to capture Viseron. He is prepared with chains and everything. This leads to him breaking down the wall sooner and arriving sooner than expected.  
\- There are two types of White Walkers. The generals who are ancient warriors killed and turned by the Night King's touch. Then there are Caster's babies who were turned while being alive to form a much stronger White Walkers. They are hybrids. But NK is never seen using them, and Bran thinks NK keeps them hidden as backup.  
\- The white walkers always left two symbols. One is a spiral, and another is a circle with a slash in the middle. The spiral is the symbol of the God of Death. NK. And the other symbol is a message to Bran. The circle represents the loop, and the slash symbolises he will break the loop.

\## **Present**

\- After the escape, everyone's whereabouts are unknown. Tormund has managed to survive, and so has ghost.  
\- After successfully distracting the white walkers, Nymeria leads the wolves away, and they scatter around the North making it impossible to go after them. Wolves casualties - 10%  
\- Nk's first objective was to erase the 3 eyed Raven's memory, by killing Bran, to put and end to the loop. His next objective is to put an end to the living.  
\- Hence NK marches to King's Landing killing everything on his way, and also looking for Bran. He can't track Bran anymore since he gave the part of his skin with the mark, to Arya.  
\- Cersei hears about the Night King approaching, and makes preparations. Euron promises her, the Night King's head.  
\- Cersei orders Mountain to never leave her side.

\## **The Seige of King's Landing**

\- Euron and Cersei are ready for the Night King. They spot the Night King, along with two White Walkers.  
\- Cersei wonders why there are only three of them. The dead army was nowhere to be seen. Euron tells her maybe they died and can't survive away from the North. Cersei points out that they could be hiding and attack any moment.  
\- Dozens of scorpions, fireballs, archers are lined up, pointed at NK and White Walker.  
\- Euron commands the first group of soldiers to attack. Every soldier's weapon shatters on contact with the white walkers. Normal weapons don't work on them. Cersei doesn't have a single Valarian weapon at her disposal. Each of the white walkers pull out two icy swords and start cutting through the army with ease.  
\- Cersei and Euron stare in absolute horror as most of their army is killed by two white walkers.  
\- The Night King walks to the middle of the battle field and raises the dead.  
\- Cersei and Euron continue to be petrified. Euron gathers courage, points the biggest scorpion at NK, and shoots it.  
\- The Night King catches it with one hand in an instant, flips it around and Javelin throws at Euron.  
\- Before Euron could react, he hung dead stuck to the wall behind him, and a giant arrow pierced through his chest.  
\- The remaining soldiers flee for their lives.  
\- The Mountain jumps down to face Night King. He charges at NK and slashes with a sword. NK dodges and drives a sword through Mountains helmet, into his skull. After mountain falls dead, NK touches him turning him into a white walker.  
\- Cersei decides to flee, but is soon killed by the Mountain who has now joined the dead.  
\- Most of the people of Kings landing are killed. Some townsfolk flee and hide wherever they find it safe. The Kings landing is now the Night King's territory.

\## **Dany's group**

\- They have retreated to the Eyrie, since Tyrion believed it is the best place for defence, and tend to the army. Everyone has reached, and gathered around.  
\- They discuss their next strategy. Bran tells them NK has taken Kings Landing, but he won't stay there for long, and will come looking for him.  
\- Some rejoice Cersei's death, but Tyrion and Jamie are sad. Especially Jamie greives her death, and the death of his unborn child.  
\- It is revealed that Dany is pregnant with Jon's child.  
\- Dany, and Bran's safety becomes the primary objective of everyone. Dany doesn't care about the iron throne anymore.  
\- Everyone finds out about Jon being Aegon, but that hardly matters at this point, when apocalypse is around the corner.  
\- There is a time skip of a few months. NK is constantly searching for Bran. Everyone has strengthend the castle's defences, and are awaiting Dany to give birth before planning an attack.  
\- There is feelings between Jamie and Brianne. But influenced by Cersei's death, Jamie doesn't act on those feelings.  
\- NK tracks them down, and attacks the tower alone, using Viserion. Drogon and Rhaegal are away hunting for food.  
\- Nobody was expecting an aerial attack. Dany was the first person NK comes across in the castle. He grabs her by the neck to kill her, but his hand starts burning. Flames cover his hand, slowly taking over his body.  
\- NK counters the fire with his ice magic, and the ice covers the flames, putting them out, and NK kills Dany.  
\- As the Ice puts out the flames, it also takes over Dany, freezing her dead body, she opens her eyes. They are now Icy Blue.  
\- Jon arrives on Rhaegal, a little too late. He furiously scorches NK, but it doesn't have any effect.  
\- A fierce ariel battle takes place between NK, Viserion, Jon, Rhegal.  
\- Rhaegal is critically injured, and can't fly anymore. But good old Rhaegal manages to get Jon to safety. Meanwhile, Bronn and the others ready dragon glass scorpions and shoot at NK and Viseron, but none of arrows hit as undead Viserion is extremely agile.  
\- Jamie is protecting Bran. From outside the castle, NK burns down the wall of the room where Bran is being kept. As Viseron is about to land, Jamie jumps out, piercing Viseron's throat with his Valerian sword. Viseron shatters into pieces, and Jamie falls down along with NK. A fitting sacrifice for Jamie for what he did to Bran.  
\- NK has no way of getting back up to the castle, and Bran tells them he's alive.  
\- Dany is now a White Walker. They manage to trap her. Nobody is sure what to do with her. Everyone is heartbroken. Melissandre says the baby inside her is still alive. Drogon returns. He's very disturbed seeing his mother in such a state. He doesn't know what to do.  
\- Dany, now a white walker is fighting hard to stay in control of her own body at mind. Having Jon and Missandae at her side helps her stay grounded. But she's slowly going crazy giving in to the madness. She tries to break out and go to the NK, so they decide to keep her bound all the time till she delivers the baby.  
\- Tyrion asks Bran to reset the timeline, but Bran wants to wait a little longer. Since the NK can't be defeated by anything and just resurrects, he wanted more answers before he reset the timeline.  
\- A few days pass. Melissandre suggests they should take Dany back to Dragon Stone, and put as much distance between her and the NK as possible. She theorises it would weaken the link between them, and stop her from joining the NK.  
\- At the same time, Bran sees the Night King approaching the castle.  
\- Jon gets ready with the army to face the Night King again, a few miles away from the castle.  
\- Jorah Mormont, Missandae, Melissandre bind Dany on Drogon and fly to Dragon Stone.

\## **Battle of The Eyrie**

\- The Battle opens with Jon waiting with the army, and Rhaegal.  
\- The undead army is the first to show. This time, the Dothraki take the offensive.  
\- They have been provided with dragon glass weapons to permanently kill the wights  
\- Jon starts firing with Rhaegal. NK is nowhere to be seen.  
\- Hound encounters Mountain, the White Walker. Mountain takes off his helmet, revealing a scary blue face. Hound recalls his childhood, where he and Mountain see a vision in the flames. Hound sees himself fighting a blue monster and killing it. Mountain sees Hound killing him, so he burns Hound's face. Now Hound realises who the monster in the vision was. After a fierce showdown, Hound almost loses, but manages to stab him with the valerian sword at the last moment ending him.  
\- Wights are about to overpower him and Arya fights them off coming to his aid. The Night King's generals arrive. Hound tells Arya to move along and that he'll handle them.  
\- Tormund dies fighting one of the generals.  
\- Jon is scouting around for the NK burning wights  
\- Brianne along with few others are standing guard at the castle.  
\- Bran is with Tyrion, Varys, Bronn, Sansa.  
\- Tyrion is trying to convince Bran to reset the timeline again. Bran is adamant to see this through. He believes the NK's end is near.  
\- Hound kills a White Walker. Some of the undead army falls with the death of the White Walker. More of them arrive overpowering Hound, killing him.  
\- NK accompanied by two white walkers, each carrying two swords, arrive at the castle.  
\- They throw kill most of the guys guarding. Brianne takes on both the white walkers. Arya joins her, and both fight side by side. They fight a long battle. Brianne manages to kill a Walker, and dies from wounds. NK kills Arya.  
\- Jon spots NK and confronts him on Rhaegal. He sees Arya lying dead and furiously draws out his Valerian sword.  
\- The White Walker charges at Jon, but Rhaegal burns him.  
\- NK glances and stares at Bran and co. who are watching from the castle.  
\- NK pulls out an ice sword and there's an ultimate showdown between the two.  
\- Meanwhile, just when the army had taken down most of the dead army, more groups of them who had been kept on the sidelines start approaching, totally overwhelming the living army. There were five times more of them now. All hope was lost for them. Every one of the living on the battlefield were dead.  
\- Jon is fighting NK while Rhaegal is supporting him. NK cut up Jon pretty bad, but Jon continues to fight. Rhaegal too has a few spears buried in him and is seriously injured. Jon uses every ounce of his strength to strike the NK with his blade, piercing and shattering him again.  
\- Bran senses NK isn't dead yet. He comes out to check, and senses NK is in the Dragon glass that was inside him. When it starts vibrating, he tells Jon to destroy it. Bronn does it instead. He smashes the dragon glass to pieces.  
\- Bran finally thinks he's achieved his goal. But without anyone noticing, the dragon glass dust is gathering, reforming. It floats in the air, and pierces a hole in Bran's chest, coming out from the other side. Bran dies with his last words being 'The loop is broken'  
\- Ice forms over the stone again, resurrecting NK. Jon struggles to get back on his feet.  
\- Bronn takes Sansa and Tyrion away from there while Varys and Jon sacrifice themselves.  
\- Rheagal manages to escape with Jon's wounded body.

\## **Jorah And Dany**

\- After reaching Dragon Stone, Jorah and Missandae search around scriptures in the cave, trying to find some answers about the white walkers, hoping to find a way to save Dany, but their efforts were in vain. But putting distance between her and NK was helping her stay more grounded.  
\- Dany starts to give birth. Melissandre is on her side. Dany gives birth to a Half ice half human baby.  
\- Jorah and Missandae return and are shocked at the turn of events. After giving birth, Dany's condition worsens and she starts to lose control again.  
\- Trying to hold onto what little sanity she has left, she asks Jorah to kill her. He refuses saying he will find a way. She tells him it's the only way. When she snaps and tries to kill Missandae Jorah pierces her with his Heartsbane sword, killing her.  
\- Heartsbane means death of one's heart. Killing Dany with the sword was the death of Jorah's heart itself.  
\- Suddenly, heartsbane starts glowing the brightest blue flames. Melissandre instantly recognises the sword is light bringer. Just like the first time, the sword has once again lit up with the sacrifice of a loved one.  
\- Drogon is really mad about Dany dying. He just leaves.  
\- Jorah is heartbroken. He tries to kill himself but Missandae stops him. She tells him it's their responsibility to take care of Dany's child and guide him on the right path.  
\- Jorah sees Rhaegal approaching. He has used every bit of his strength to fly their with serious wounds. He falls into the ocean just few metres away from the shore. Jorah rushes and brings Jon out. Few locals help get the Rheghal out. He was already dead.  
\- Jon too was too injured to survive. Sansa, Tyrion, Bronn reach there in a few days.  
\- Jon is on the the verge of death. Melissandre uses her magic to help him maintain consciousness for some last words. He can't be revived this time. After being saddened by Dany's death, he tells Sansa to stay away from westeros. He requests Sansa, Jorah and Missandae to be his child's guardians. He names the child Rhaemon Targeryan (After Aemon Targeryan, and Rhaegal)  
\- Jon dies soon after. They mourn and bury his body.  
\- Melissandre dissappears. Nobody knows what happened to her. They think she died.

\## **16 years later..**

\- Westeros is post apocalyptic. Most of the living are dead. Some are in hiding.  
\- NK can't cross the oceans and reach dragonstone. Rhaegal saved the entire essos by not getting captured by NK.  
\- Tyrion and Bron do nothing but drink around and fuck all day.  
\- After going through such an ordeal together, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah, Missandae and Sansa stay close by watching over each other like family. Everyone feels a responsibility for the child Rhaemon.  
\- Rhaemon Targeryan has grown up to be a wonderful young lad. He looks like a human, but has silver hair, and the icy blue eyes of a white walker. He looks almost identical to Jon Snow, except for his silver hair.  
\- He has learnt valuable things from his guardians. Rhaemon is a quick learner. Jorah and Bronn has trained him to be a warrior. He's turned out so strong that there's nobody in the essos that can bring him down.  
\- Rhaemon discovered he can use ice magic when Jorah and Bronn started teaching him to fight at the age of 5. He uses ice magic on his weapons to make them invulnerable. He's also physically a lot of times stronger than a normal human.  
\- Drogon never came back to them. But he would sometimes fly over, watch young Rhaemon play, and would secretly watch over him.  
\- Rhaemon goes looking for Drogon after finding out he was his mother's Dragon.  
\- Drogon accepts him instantly. Sansa didn't want Rhaemon riding the Dragon, since news of the Targeryan Prince would spread and it would only do him harm.  
\- But Rhaemon was a rebel anyway.  
\- All his life, Rhaemon has wanted to travel to westeros. Hearing stories of the things that happened there, he was fascinated.  
\- His hunger for battle was another thing that drew him towards westeros. He asks Sansa and she forbids him from talking about it. Jorah answers some of his questions, but it wasn't enough.  
\- He finds Tyrion thinking he might give him some proper answers.  
\- Tyrion fills him in on the important things. Now Rhaemon is adamant to meet this mighty Night King and defeat him. He asks Bronn to accompany him, but Bronn refuses. Rhaemon manipulates Bronn by telling him they can just give a short visit and come back. And that westeros must be loaded with unclaimed treasure everywhere. Bronn agrees.  
\- Rhaemon steals Jorah's Valerian sword before leaving.

\## **The finale**

\- White walker hybrids are seen preserved in a place beyond the wall. They start waking up and head towards Kings landing.  
\- Meanwhile, Rhaemon and Bronn reach westeros on Drogon. Bronn wants to check Kings Landing first since most of the treasures lay there.  
\- Seeing Kings landing infested with White walkers, Bronn suspects the Night King is there and wants to head back. Rhaemon tells him his true intentions that he wanted to kill the Night King.  
\- Despite Bronn's repeated pleas, Rhaemon enters Kings landing and starts burning the dead and the white walkers.  
\- The Night King shows up. Rhaemon Jumps down and stands grinning before him. He's excited to fight the strongest creature on Earth. And for some reason he was always felt drawn there.  
\- White walkers run upto him trying to attack him, but they back away immediately seeing Rhaemon's Icy blue eyes.  
\- Hybrid White Walkers (those made from baby sacrifices) arrive. They are faster and much stronger than normal Walkers. Rhaemon pulls out Heartsbane and takes them on. Bronn jumps down and saves Rhaemon from a surprise attack and tells him to stop being so cocky and overconfident. They work together along with Drogon and take down all the hybrids.  
\- Amidst the battle NK throws a spear at Rhaemon, but he catches it and sends it right back into NK's chest. Bronn is amazed and secretly proud of him.  
\- NK pulls out an ice sword. Drogon and Bronn get ready to attack, but Rhaemon signals them to stay back and that he wants to do this alone.  
\- He uses ice magic on Heartsbane, turning it to ice. Then it starts glowing in the brightest blue flame. NK is seen having a terrified expression for the first time.  
\- As they dual, heartsbane clashing against NK's sword, producing a rhythm that echoed through the walls. It almost sounded like a song. Beautiful, yet overwhelming. A music that gave the Night King PTSD flashbacks of the first time he was killed.  
\- The Wights show up in swarms. But none of them could come anywhere near the brilliant aura and the sound vibrations of sword. The true Song Of Ice And Fire. Rhaemon's presence alone terrified them.  
\- Rhaemon finally drove the sword through NK's chest. NK gasps in terror as flames start covering him. The flame covered icy sword burns The Night King evaporating him, and turning the Dragon Glass to ash.  
\- The dead fall, and the ice covering Kings Landing slowly melts, fading away. The Long Night has ended.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning - Long read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so disappointed with the show that I decided to rewrite this whole season to see how better things could&amp;#39;ve been with a little effort and passion. It might be a long read but I promise it&amp;#39;ll be worth your time. I present you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;The season that was promised&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two episodes will happen as it is, since they were almost perfect. Except in episode 2, there&amp;#39;s one change. Bronn reaches winterfell before the battle. He makes the deal with Tyrion. And Tyrion asks for his help in the battle, but Bronn says he doesn&amp;#39;t want to fight anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Winterfell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything will go similar as the episode with a few exceptions.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion isn&amp;#39;t in the crypt. He&amp;#39;s up watching the battle from a good vantage point.&lt;br/&gt;
- Unsullied are on the front since the main focus is defence. Dothraki in the back.&lt;br/&gt;
- Arya is nowhere to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;
- Ghost hasn&amp;#39;t made an appearance.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon fights Viserion with Rhaegal and brings it down after a fierce battle.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dany is busy roasting the dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Everything is futile in the end. Battle is almost lost.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK makes it to Bran. He kills Theon. Bran, NK have their staring contest. NK approaches to kill Bran. But to his surprise, the crippled Bran jumps catching him off guard stabbing him with the Valerian dagger. NK shatters, the dead fall. It is revealed that Arya was disguised as Bran.&lt;br/&gt;
- Episode ends. Jorah isn&amp;#39;t dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Melissandre isn&amp;#39;t dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- 60% of the unsullied, 40% of the Dothraki are dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;The Upcoming events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- There&amp;#39;s a flashback scene of Tyrion, Bran, Arya in deep discussion. Arya isn&amp;#39;t happy with Bran being the bait. She insists to do it on his behalf, but Bran tells her NK can track him as long as he has his mark on his skin.&lt;br/&gt;
- Since Bran knows about Arya, he suggests he could give her the part of his skin with NK&amp;#39;s mark.&lt;br/&gt;
- It is also revealed that Arya doesn&amp;#39;t have to kill someone to take their face. There is face magic involved and she has to make the face.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion requests Bronn to take Bran away from the battle and keep him safe in case the NK plan fails. He makes an extra deal offering more money.&lt;br/&gt;
- Only Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Bronn were aware of these plans while everyone else thought Bran was at the tree.&lt;br/&gt;
- At the place where NK was stabbed, the camera zooms in to show a piece of dragon glass glowing. The Dragon Glass that was stuck into a human by the children of the forest. The glass floats up in the air, forming ice, and the NK is back! His conciousness was inside the Dragon glass all along, and that is the source of him!&lt;br/&gt;
- Bronn is riding a chariot taking Bran away, while Bran is warging watching the Battle of Winterfell. He sees Night King get shattered. He opens his eyes and tells Bronn to turn back, and that it isn&amp;#39;t over. The Night King isn&amp;#39;t dead and everyone are in danger. Bronn disagrees. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to risk Bran&amp;#39;s life and lose the money Tyrion promised him.&lt;br/&gt;
- The dead start waking up, so does Viserion. Everyone are caught off guard. Arya is cornered by suddenly resurrected white walkers. The NK is staring at her, while one of the white walkers is proceeding to kill her.&lt;br/&gt;
- The White walker is caught off guard by a wolf! It&amp;#39;s Nymeria! Hundreds of wolves start attacking the white walkers and the dead. Nymeria has brought every wolf in the North to their rescue.&lt;br/&gt;
- Ghost has arrived to help Jon out of a bind too. Both Jon and Arya are overjoyed to see their wolves. There&amp;#39;s a sweet reunion amidist the chaos.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion and Sansa already had arranged for plan B to save as many people as possible planning for a getaway.&lt;br/&gt;
- Everyone retreats. Some on Dragons, some on chariots, some on horses.&lt;br/&gt;
- The wolves help in holding back the dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Some others who stay back are, Tormund, Greyworm along with a few unsullied and serve as distractions.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon wants to stay but Dany insists it is wise to retreat and make a proper plan. Greyworm&amp;#39;s death is seen by Dany and Missandae while flying away on the Dragon. Missandae bursts into tears and Dany is angry, sad.&lt;br/&gt;
- As they are retreating, Tyrion is on Rhaegal with Jon Snow. There&amp;#39;s a flashback scene where Tyrion is having trouble processing the conversation he had with Bran in episode 2, right after they make their plans with Arya, and Bronn. When they were alone, Tyrion asks Bran about the things he&amp;#39;s seen. Bran touches Tyrion&amp;#39;s hand, and uses magic to show him a few key events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;Things Tyrion sees in the flashback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Bran and NK are both stuck in a time loop. The loop started this way, in the first timeline, there was no wall. There was only the post apocalyptic westeros, where the living were hunted down. People lived in fear, hiding from the Wights and the Walkers. In this timeline, Bran isn&amp;#39;t crippled. He&amp;#39;s a warg, and he hones his skills to defeat NK and put an end to the Long Night. There&amp;#39;s a final showdown between Bran and NK. When he is almost killed by NK Bran uses his warging to jump back in time into the body of a random guy and builds the wall, becoming Bran the Builder.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK is the God of Death resurrected by the children of the forest by using a spell and sacrificing a human. They didn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;create&amp;#39; him. They only thought they did, and they realized they fucked up when he started trying to massacre every living thing. So, timeline resets when Bran jumps back, but not for NK. He has memories intact since he&amp;#39;s a God. Bran upon reaching old age, decides to preserve himself in the WW tree(weirwood tree) using an ancient spell involving ravens, to pass on knowledge to the next Bran. But NK always knows when there&amp;#39;s a reset. But when Bran is in the WW tree, NK has no way of entering and killing him. So he waits for thousands of years for WW Bran(weirwood Bran) to come out. Then came new Bran to WW Bran, and transferred his memories to him.&lt;br/&gt;
- When this happens, NK starts to make a move. The Wall contains magic and no undead can pass it. That&amp;#39;s why NK waits for the winter, for the seas to freeze so he can walk around the wall. NK wins, Bran jumps back, both try to change things, repeat.&lt;br/&gt;
- When Bran made a certain change, it would have certain outcomes. He will have to keep making those changes in every timeline to have a better grip over the outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;
- One of such change was, warging into the Targeryan King and telling him to &amp;#39;Burn them all&amp;#39; meaning burn the white walkers. But like how Hodor lost his mind when Bran warged into his past, the king lost his mind and became The Mad King.&lt;br/&gt;
- The last timeline was very similar to this one. Past Bran secures the Dragon eggs to use them in future. He can&amp;#39;t predict what the changed events outcome will be. He only knows the patterns of the previous timeline, outcomes. So he technically doesn&amp;#39;t know everything. The eggs end up with Dany. But she had no reason to come to the North. She got to King&amp;#39;s Landing, destroyed Cersei. NK walked across the seas, came for Bran. Reset timeline.&lt;br/&gt;
- Like the God of Death, the Lord of light can&amp;#39;t be resurrected. Many have tried and failed. Bran uses his knowledge on ancient magic to form a bridge or connection between the world and the Lord of light. Hence the Lord has limited influence over the world.&lt;br/&gt;
- Some present timeline changes are, WW Bran seeks the help from Lord of the Light. That leads to Jon staying alive, and some other resurrections. Jon brings Dany to the North. WW Bran accidently gets new Bran marked by NK. This disables the magic on the wall.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK having knowledge of the previous timeline, uses it to capture Viseron. He is prepared with chains and everything. This leads to him breaking down the wall sooner and arriving sooner than expected.&lt;br/&gt;
- There are two types of White Walkers. The generals who are ancient warriors killed and turned by the Night King&amp;#39;s touch. Then there are Caster&amp;#39;s babies who were turned while being alive to form a much stronger White Walkers. They are hybrids. But NK is never seen using them, and Bran thinks NK keeps them hidden as backup.&lt;br/&gt;
- The white walkers always left two symbols. One is a spiral, and another is a circle with a slash in the middle. The spiral is the symbol of the God of Death. NK. And the other symbol is a message to Bran. The circle represents the loop, and the slash symbolises he will break the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- After the escape, everyone&amp;#39;s whereabouts are unknown. Tormund has managed to survive, and so has ghost.&lt;br/&gt;
- After successfully distracting the white walkers, Nymeria leads the wolves away, and they scatter around the North making it impossible to go after them. Wolves casualties - 10%&lt;br/&gt;
- Nk&amp;#39;s first objective was to erase the 3 eyed Raven&amp;#39;s memory, by killing Bran, to put and end to the loop. His next objective is to put an end to the living.&lt;br/&gt;
- Hence NK marches to King&amp;#39;s Landing killing everything on his way, and also looking for Bran. He can&amp;#39;t track Bran anymore since he gave the part of his skin with the mark, to Arya.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei hears about the Night King approaching, and makes preparations. Euron promises her, the Night King&amp;#39;s head.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei orders Mountain to never leave her side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;The Seige of King&amp;#39;s Landing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Euron and Cersei are ready for the Night King. They spot the Night King, along with two White Walkers.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei wonders why there are only three of them. The dead army was nowhere to be seen. Euron tells her maybe they died and can&amp;#39;t survive away from the North. Cersei points out that they could be hiding and attack any moment.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dozens of scorpions, fireballs, archers are lined up, pointed at NK and White Walker.&lt;br/&gt;
- Euron commands the first group of soldiers to attack. Every soldier&amp;#39;s weapon shatters on contact with the white walkers. Normal weapons don&amp;#39;t work on them. Cersei doesn&amp;#39;t have a single Valarian weapon at her disposal. Each of the white walkers pull out two icy swords and start cutting through the army with ease.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei and Euron stare in absolute horror as most of their army is killed by two white walkers.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Night King walks to the middle of the battle field and raises the dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei and Euron continue to be petrified. Euron gathers courage, points the biggest scorpion at NK, and shoots it.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Night King catches it with one hand in an instant, flips it around and Javelin throws at Euron.&lt;br/&gt;
- Before Euron could react, he hung dead stuck to the wall behind him, and a giant arrow pierced through his chest.&lt;br/&gt;
- The remaining soldiers flee for their lives.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Mountain jumps down to face Night King. He charges at NK and slashes with a sword. NK dodges and drives a sword through Mountains helmet, into his skull. After mountain falls dead, NK touches him turning him into a white walker.&lt;br/&gt;
- Cersei decides to flee, but is soon killed by the Mountain who has now joined the dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Most of the people of Kings landing are killed. Some townsfolk flee and hide wherever they find it safe. The Kings landing is now the Night King&amp;#39;s territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;Dany&amp;#39;s group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- They have retreated to the Eyrie, since Tyrion believed it is the best place for defence, and tend to the army. Everyone has reached, and gathered around.&lt;br/&gt;
- They discuss their next strategy. Bran tells them NK has taken Kings Landing, but he won&amp;#39;t stay there for long, and will come looking for him.&lt;br/&gt;
- Some rejoice Cersei&amp;#39;s death, but Tyrion and Jamie are sad. Especially Jamie greives her death, and the death of his unborn child.&lt;br/&gt;
- It is revealed that Dany is pregnant with Jon&amp;#39;s child.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dany, and Bran&amp;#39;s safety becomes the primary objective of everyone. Dany doesn&amp;#39;t care about the iron throne anymore.&lt;br/&gt;
- Everyone finds out about Jon being Aegon, but that hardly matters at this point, when apocalypse is around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;
- There is a time skip of a few months. NK is constantly searching for Bran. Everyone has strengthend the castle&amp;#39;s defences, and are awaiting Dany to give birth before planning an attack.&lt;br/&gt;
- There is feelings between Jamie and Brianne. But influenced by Cersei&amp;#39;s death, Jamie doesn&amp;#39;t act on those feelings.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK tracks them down, and attacks the tower alone, using Viserion. Drogon and Rhaegal are away hunting for food.&lt;br/&gt;
- Nobody was expecting an aerial attack. Dany was the first person NK comes across in the castle. He grabs her by the neck to kill her, but his hand starts burning. Flames cover his hand, slowly taking over his body.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK counters the fire with his ice magic, and the ice covers the flames, putting them out, and NK kills Dany.&lt;br/&gt;
- As the Ice puts out the flames, it also takes over Dany, freezing her dead body, she opens her eyes. They are now Icy Blue.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon arrives on Rhaegal, a little too late. He furiously scorches NK, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have any effect.&lt;br/&gt;
- A fierce ariel battle takes place between NK, Viserion, Jon, Rhegal.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaegal is critically injured, and can&amp;#39;t fly anymore. But good old Rhaegal manages to get Jon to safety. Meanwhile, Bronn and the others ready dragon glass scorpions and shoot at NK and Viseron, but none of arrows hit as undead Viserion is extremely agile.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jamie is protecting Bran. From outside the castle, NK burns down the wall of the room where Bran is being kept. As Viseron is about to land, Jamie jumps out, piercing Viseron&amp;#39;s throat with his Valerian sword. Viseron shatters into pieces, and Jamie falls down along with NK. A fitting sacrifice for Jamie for what he did to Bran.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK has no way of getting back up to the castle, and Bran tells them he&amp;#39;s alive.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dany is now a White Walker. They manage to trap her. Nobody is sure what to do with her. Everyone is heartbroken. Melissandre says the baby inside her is still alive. Drogon returns. He&amp;#39;s very disturbed seeing his mother in such a state. He doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dany, now a white walker is fighting hard to stay in control of her own body at mind. Having Jon and Missandae at her side helps her stay grounded. But she&amp;#39;s slowly going crazy giving in to the madness. She tries to break out and go to the NK, so they decide to keep her bound all the time till she delivers the baby.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion asks Bran to reset the timeline, but Bran wants to wait a little longer. Since the NK can&amp;#39;t be defeated by anything and just resurrects, he wanted more answers before he reset the timeline.&lt;br/&gt;
- A few days pass. Melissandre suggests they should take Dany back to Dragon Stone, and put as much distance between her and the NK as possible. She theorises it would weaken the link between them, and stop her from joining the NK.&lt;br/&gt;
- At the same time, Bran sees the Night King approaching the castle.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon gets ready with the army to face the Night King again, a few miles away from the castle.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jorah Mormont, Missandae, Melissandre bind Dany on Drogon and fly to Dragon Stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;Battle of The Eyrie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The Battle opens with Jon waiting with the army, and Rhaegal.&lt;br/&gt;
- The undead army is the first to show. This time, the Dothraki take the offensive.&lt;br/&gt;
- They have been provided with dragon glass weapons to permanently kill the wights&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon starts firing with Rhaegal. NK is nowhere to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;
- Hound encounters Mountain, the White Walker. Mountain takes off his helmet, revealing a scary blue face. Hound recalls his childhood, where he and Mountain see a vision in the flames. Hound sees himself fighting a blue monster and killing it. Mountain sees Hound killing him, so he burns Hound&amp;#39;s face. Now Hound realises who the monster in the vision was. After a fierce showdown, Hound almost loses, but manages to stab him with the valerian sword at the last moment ending him.&lt;br/&gt;
- Wights are about to overpower him and Arya fights them off coming to his aid. The Night King&amp;#39;s generals arrive. Hound tells Arya to move along and that he&amp;#39;ll handle them.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tormund dies fighting one of the generals.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon is scouting around for the NK burning wights&lt;br/&gt;
- Brianne along with few others are standing guard at the castle.&lt;br/&gt;
- Bran is with Tyrion, Varys, Bronn, Sansa.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion is trying to convince Bran to reset the timeline again. Bran is adamant to see this through. He believes the NK&amp;#39;s end is near.&lt;br/&gt;
- Hound kills a White Walker. Some of the undead army falls with the death of the White Walker. More of them arrive overpowering Hound, killing him.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK accompanied by two white walkers, each carrying two swords, arrive at the castle.&lt;br/&gt;
- They throw kill most of the guys guarding. Brianne takes on both the white walkers. Arya joins her, and both fight side by side. They fight a long battle. Brianne manages to kill a Walker, and dies from wounds. NK kills Arya.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon spots NK and confronts him on Rhaegal. He sees Arya lying dead and furiously draws out his Valerian sword.&lt;br/&gt;
- The White Walker charges at Jon, but Rhaegal burns him.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK glances and stares at Bran and co. who are watching from the castle.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK pulls out an ice sword and there&amp;#39;s an ultimate showdown between the two.&lt;br/&gt;
- Meanwhile, just when the army had taken down most of the dead army, more groups of them who had been kept on the sidelines start approaching, totally overwhelming the living army. There were five times more of them now. All hope was lost for them. Every one of the living on the battlefield were dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon is fighting NK while Rhaegal is supporting him. NK cut up Jon pretty bad, but Jon continues to fight. Rhaegal too has a few spears buried in him and is seriously injured. Jon uses every ounce of his strength to strike the NK with his blade, piercing and shattering him again.&lt;br/&gt;
- Bran senses NK isn&amp;#39;t dead yet. He comes out to check, and senses NK is in the Dragon glass that was inside him. When it starts vibrating, he tells Jon to destroy it. Bronn does it instead. He smashes the dragon glass to pieces.&lt;br/&gt;
- Bran finally thinks he&amp;#39;s achieved his goal. But without anyone noticing, the dragon glass dust is gathering, reforming. It floats in the air, and pierces a hole in Bran&amp;#39;s chest, coming out from the other side. Bran dies with his last words being &amp;#39;The loop is broken&amp;#39;&lt;br/&gt;
- Ice forms over the stone again, resurrecting NK. Jon struggles to get back on his feet.&lt;br/&gt;
- Bronn takes Sansa and Tyrion away from there while Varys and Jon sacrifice themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rheagal manages to escape with Jon&amp;#39;s wounded body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;Jorah And Dany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- After reaching Dragon Stone, Jorah and Missandae search around scriptures in the cave, trying to find some answers about the white walkers, hoping to find a way to save Dany, but their efforts were in vain. But putting distance between her and NK was helping her stay more grounded.&lt;br/&gt;
- Dany starts to give birth. Melissandre is on her side. Dany gives birth to a Half ice half human baby.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jorah and Missandae return and are shocked at the turn of events. After giving birth, Dany&amp;#39;s condition worsens and she starts to lose control again.&lt;br/&gt;
- Trying to hold onto what little sanity she has left, she asks Jorah to kill her. He refuses saying he will find a way. She tells him it&amp;#39;s the only way. When she snaps and tries to kill Missandae Jorah pierces her with his Heartsbane sword, killing her.&lt;br/&gt;
- Heartsbane means death of one&amp;#39;s heart. Killing Dany with the sword was the death of Jorah&amp;#39;s heart itself.&lt;br/&gt;
- Suddenly, heartsbane starts glowing the brightest blue flames. Melissandre instantly recognises the sword is light bringer. Just like the first time, the sword has once again lit up with the sacrifice of a loved one.&lt;br/&gt;
- Drogon is really mad about Dany dying. He just leaves.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jorah is heartbroken. He tries to kill himself but Missandae stops him. She tells him it&amp;#39;s their responsibility to take care of Dany&amp;#39;s child and guide him on the right path.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jorah sees Rhaegal approaching. He has used every bit of his strength to fly their with serious wounds. He falls into the ocean just few metres away from the shore. Jorah rushes and brings Jon out. Few locals help get the Rheghal out. He was already dead.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon too was too injured to survive. Sansa, Tyrion, Bronn reach there in a few days.&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon is on the the verge of death. Melissandre uses her magic to help him maintain consciousness for some last words. He can&amp;#39;t be revived this time. After being saddened by Dany&amp;#39;s death, he tells Sansa to stay away from westeros. He requests Sansa, Jorah and Missandae to be his child&amp;#39;s guardians. He names the child Rhaemon Targeryan (After Aemon Targeryan, and Rhaegal)&lt;br/&gt;
- Jon dies soon after. They mourn and bury his body.&lt;br/&gt;
- Melissandre dissappears. Nobody knows what happened to her. They think she died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;16 years later..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Westeros is post apocalyptic. Most of the living are dead. Some are in hiding.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK can&amp;#39;t cross the oceans and reach dragonstone. Rhaegal saved the entire essos by not getting captured by NK.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion and Bron do nothing but drink around and fuck all day.&lt;br/&gt;
- After going through such an ordeal together, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah, Missandae and Sansa stay close by watching over each other like family. Everyone feels a responsibility for the child Rhaemon.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaemon Targeryan has grown up to be a wonderful young lad. He looks like a human, but has silver hair, and the icy blue eyes of a white walker. He looks almost identical to Jon Snow, except for his silver hair.&lt;br/&gt;
- He has learnt valuable things from his guardians. Rhaemon is a quick learner. Jorah and Bronn has trained him to be a warrior. He&amp;#39;s turned out so strong that there&amp;#39;s nobody in the essos that can bring him down.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaemon discovered he can use ice magic when Jorah and Bronn started teaching him to fight at the age of 5. He uses ice magic on his weapons to make them invulnerable. He&amp;#39;s also physically a lot of times stronger than a normal human.&lt;br/&gt;
- Drogon never came back to them. But he would sometimes fly over, watch young Rhaemon play, and would secretly watch over him.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaemon goes looking for Drogon after finding out he was his mother&amp;#39;s Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;
- Drogon accepts him instantly. Sansa didn&amp;#39;t want Rhaemon riding the Dragon, since news of the Targeryan Prince would spread and it would only do him harm.&lt;br/&gt;
- But Rhaemon was a rebel anyway.&lt;br/&gt;
- All his life, Rhaemon has wanted to travel to westeros. Hearing stories of the things that happened there, he was fascinated.&lt;br/&gt;
- His hunger for battle was another thing that drew him towards westeros. He asks Sansa and she forbids him from talking about it. Jorah answers some of his questions, but it wasn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;br/&gt;
- He finds Tyrion thinking he might give him some proper answers.&lt;br/&gt;
- Tyrion fills him in on the important things. Now Rhaemon is adamant to meet this mighty Night King and defeat him. He asks Bronn to accompany him, but Bronn refuses. Rhaemon manipulates Bronn by telling him they can just give a short visit and come back. And that westeros must be loaded with unclaimed treasure everywhere. Bronn agrees.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaemon steals Jorah&amp;#39;s Valerian sword before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## &lt;strong&gt;The finale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- White walker hybrids are seen preserved in a place beyond the wall. They start waking up and head towards Kings landing.&lt;br/&gt;
- Meanwhile, Rhaemon and Bronn reach westeros on Drogon. Bronn wants to check Kings Landing first since most of the treasures lay there.&lt;br/&gt;
- Seeing Kings landing infested with White walkers, Bronn suspects the Night King is there and wants to head back. Rhaemon tells him his true intentions that he wanted to kill the Night King.&lt;br/&gt;
- Despite Bronn&amp;#39;s repeated pleas, Rhaemon enters Kings landing and starts burning the dead and the white walkers.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Night King shows up. Rhaemon Jumps down and stands grinning before him. He&amp;#39;s excited to fight the strongest creature on Earth. And for some reason he was always felt drawn there.&lt;br/&gt;
- White walkers run upto him trying to attack him, but they back away immediately seeing Rhaemon&amp;#39;s Icy blue eyes.&lt;br/&gt;
- Hybrid White Walkers (those made from baby sacrifices) arrive. They are faster and much stronger than normal Walkers. Rhaemon pulls out Heartsbane and takes them on. Bronn jumps down and saves Rhaemon from a surprise attack and tells him to stop being so cocky and overconfident. They work together along with Drogon and take down all the hybrids.&lt;br/&gt;
- Amidst the battle NK throws a spear at Rhaemon, but he catches it and sends it right back into NK&amp;#39;s chest. Bronn is amazed and secretly proud of him.&lt;br/&gt;
- NK pulls out an ice sword. Drogon and Bronn get ready to attack, but Rhaemon signals them to stay back and that he wants to do this alone.&lt;br/&gt;
- He uses ice magic on Heartsbane, turning it to ice. Then it starts glowing in the brightest blue flame. NK is seen having a terrified expression for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;
- As they dual, heartsbane clashing against NK&amp;#39;s sword, producing a rhythm that echoed through the walls. It almost sounded like a song. Beautiful, yet overwhelming. A music that gave the Night King PTSD flashbacks of the first time he was killed.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Wights show up in swarms. But none of them could come anywhere near the brilliant aura and the sound vibrations of sword. The true Song Of Ice And Fire. Rhaemon&amp;#39;s presence alone terrified them.&lt;br/&gt;
- Rhaemon finally drove the sword through NK&amp;#39;s chest. NK gasps in terror as flames start covering him. The flame covered icy sword burns The Night King evaporating him, and turning the Dragon Glass to ash.&lt;br/&gt;
- The dead fall, and the ice covering Kings Landing slowly melts, fading away. The Long Night has ended.&lt;/p&gt;

BUT could we be jumping the gun on the show... could this be D&amp;D‚Äôs whole plan? Make the GOT community confused and angry... I know there‚Äôs only 1 episode left but we all know how well this show is wrote (normally) so I believe they can still give us and epic GOT worthy ending that could completely knock our socks off! 

How you ask? Well let me tell ya... it all starts with our little creep Bran. We‚Äôre seen story arc after story arc having a ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù finish for their characters. Everyone but Brans... wasn‚Äôt Bran a part of the NK‚Äôs story... why didn‚Äôt we get any more depth into his story? Why is every conversation that is had with Bran not shown to the viewers... they could have used that time to give us depth for his character. Is it sloppy writing or is there a reason he is still shrouded in mystery?

I believe that Bloodraven has orchestrated all of the events to happen to get Bran into that tree so he could escape the NK and is using Lord of Light magic to glamour himself to look like Bran. Bloodraven has been working with the Children of the Forest and given special powers to fulfill their own purpose which is to take out Man. They created the NK but they clearly screwed up, made him too powerful, so they needed to create the antithesis to him to even the powers out, which was the Bloodraven/The Lord of Light. They gave Bloodraven the Lord of Light Power and protected him from the NK because they needed him to finish their war, which was to take back what was taken from them. The Children and Bloodraven knew the NK was closing in on them, they called upon Bran to come north so they could escape, but their plan went south when Bran went into a vision alone and was touched by the NK. The Children then made a choice to sacrifice themselves to allow the Bloodraven to escape and finish their plan. When the NK stabbed Bloodraven in the tree I believe that was actually Bran and ‚ÄúBran‚Äù escaping on the sled was actually Bloodraven using glamor to look like Bran.

I realize this is too much for one episode, which is why I don‚Äôt think this is how it was go down in the show. This will be explained throughout the books. On the show we will see Dany go ‚Äúmad queen‚Äù burn the city down and create chaos amongst the seven kingdoms. Jon will be forced to take a side and it will force him to kill Dany. Jon will then either take the black or go north to live with ghost and Tormund. Sansa will stay as Lady of Winterfell. Arya will probably go back to the faceless men or possibly realize that part of her life is done now and accept Gendry‚Äôs proposal. And what is left of Kings Landing will probably be given to Bran to help oversee the rebuilding. We will be left assuming this is it. Until our boy Sam stumbles upon a passage in on the books on the Bloodraven his true nature and since Sam has spent the most time with Bran (in his current state) he will then put the pieces together.

(oh, and he&amp;#39;ll probably kill Grey Worm/get killed by Grey Worm - you saw how they looked at each other during the Sack of King&amp;#39;s Landing!)&lt;/p&gt;

But the writing - and specifically in light of some ridiculous pacing - is completely off.

The character development and intricate plot-lines have been what has elevated the show to the platform it's on today.

Now, all of that seems significantly cheapened, with the story being sold out to cliches.

It's difficult to see then how HBO would allow that to happen in its final and most anticipated season. They have invested far too much money into the show - with further spin-offs in the pipeline - to allow the whole project to collapse in on itself.

We also know that JRRM has laid out the ending for them. And I can see this all as added pressure to get to that end point in the limited time left.

My theory here is that, while the character development and slowly evolving plotlines were part and parcel of the books/shows identity, they are somewhat of a means to an end in order to execute some incredible twists and reveals.

Think about how much you have invested in characters and theories - only for them to be killed off dead in front of you.

The final season seems so poorly paced if you consider that the Night King, Jon, Danny, Arya, Westeros, desire for the throne, and a few other arcs are all somewhat independent to each other, thus requiring their own individual conclusions and payoffs.

But what if they are not independent narratives that occasionally cross over? What if they are all intimately connected together by a larger story, the existence of which hasn't been fully revealed to us yet?

Enter: the Usual Suspects. A movie that, for the most part, seems just alright - pretty forgettable even. That is, until the final three minutes.

Here, we learnt that the knowledgable and vulnerable cripple who had spent the duration of the story helping us fill in the blanks on a neigh-mythical and faceless bad guy, was in fact the bad guy who had been misleading us the whole time for his own ends.

A montage takes us back to all the points where we were deceived, completely reframing the nature of everything that had happened before.

We know the Night King was made by the Children of the Forest to fight the First Men, before he turned on the CotF themselves.

But what if the Night King retained more of his humanity than intended and never offensively attacked the First Men to begin with, and instead solely directed his anger towards the people who had turned him into a monster?

What if, feeling under threat from all fronts, the CotF once again decided to turn a man into a weapon - creating the 3ER whose sole purpose was to manipulate the First Men into viewing the NK and Walkers as an enemy that was preparing to destroy them. Turning your enemies on themselves, essentially.

We know that the First Men later joined forces with the CotF to repel the Walkers and build the wall - conveniently sealing the First Men off from the CotF, as well as the Walkers.

If you were the Night King, would you not try to imprison the 3ER, if you could not kill him, to prevent him from manipulating the First Men any further?

When we first meet the 3ER in real life, he is stuck in a tree and surrounded by buried wights as traps. It is a prison.

We know the 3ER manipulated the world around him to create the events were Bran was brought to him with Jojen and Meera.

Bran did not leave that cave. But the Three-Eyed Raven did.

If you were the Night King, and knew the 3ER had finally managed to escape, and was now back in the midst of men, would you not try to go after him and stop him before the 3ER goes on to do irreparable damage with his scheming?

Maybe out of self-preservation through 3ER helping to dial the ""We need to kill all the Walkers"" sentiment south of the wall up to 11. Or maybe because you are more human than weapon, and are concerned to what will happen to an entire continent at the hands of someone who is more weapon than human?

What if that is the real story of Ice and Fire?

I think the show will end with that reveal. Showing the 3ER slowly influencing from his prison cell events over the previous decades that lead to the fall of Arys, Robert's victory, and the subsequent Game of Thrones

Followed them by his grooming of Bran and those around him to plot his release. And everything he has done to ensure that he ends up on the Iron Throne, having power over all mankind, without a Night King left to stop him.

With an ending like that, the pace of this season becomes infinitely more acceptable. Because such a reveal would serve to be the ultimate resolution to many outstanding plot-lines.

Such an ending would also make a lot of sense in terms of future direction for the franchise, with this new series now in production:

&gt;It takes place in the Age of Heroes, a period that begins roughly 10,000 years before the events of *Game of Thrones*. Notable events of that period include the foundation of powerful Houses, the Long Night when the White Walkers first descended upon Westeros, and the Andal Invasion when the Andals invaded from Essos and conquered most of Westeros.

And then there is this from JRRM:

Here is my theory as to why Gendry will sit upon the Iron Throne at the end. NB: For my theory to work we sadly lose all other contenders and pretenders to the Iron Throne.

As Lord of Storm's End Gendry now has a huge powerbase in addition to Northern support. Gendry is a hero of the Long Night - even though many might not know it yet. Gendry is the son, now accepted and acknowledged, of Robert Baratheon - the last stable (in a political sense) ruler of Westoros in 40 years. Gendry is not associated with Dany after the events of the Long Night and is therefore free of stain on his reputation. The Baratheon name is also very important and has huge weight among the people. Baratheon's overthrew the mad king. Joffrey and Tommen are two cruel and weak leaders but almost everyone is doubts, or fully knows, that they are not Baratheons. Even Stannis and the beloved Renly appear noble and just when compared to the mad king, Joffrey and Cersei. So Gendry has the potential military and popular support of the people to launch a coup or step into a situation that left no other survivors.

Furthermore the battle for the Iron Throne is clearly inspired by the dynastic conflicts of the Lords and Royals of the British Isles. For example 'The Black Dinner' of Scottish History and the Red Wedding (RIP Robb Stark).

The main conflict seems to resemble the War Of The Roses - the struggle between house York and House Lancaster for the English throne with different factions claiming their right through different previous rulers but in the end the only survivor is Henry Tudor - a man with very little claim. He's our Gendry (who is a bastard) who sweeps in at the end of the war to overthrow the 'mad' Richard III (Our Dany). Richard III is famous for killing off his own nephews (Our Jon Snow) who had a better and stronger claim than him. I think Game Of Thrones might end in a similar fashion to the War of The Roses as well. It ended with a reluctant marriage between Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York. This political marriage ended the conflict and brought the warring sides together. Elizabeth could be either Sansa or Arya with the latter being more likely. They are all that remains of House Stark and control the powerful North. A political marriage would cement Gendry's position and stabilize the realm. 

This echoes back to the very first epsiode where Robert Baratheon insists upon Ned Stark that his son marry his daughter to unite the house. Presumably to stabilize the realm against what Robert sees as the rising Lannister influence.

Another early show reference to Gendry could be seen, or rather not seen, when the Starks happen upon the dead (Royal) stag and direwolves that have killed each other. This is symbolic of Robert and Ned's actions leading to both houses. Robert and Ned soon die. Each of the surviving cub direwolves suffer along with their respective Starks. However what is missing is the stag's offspring. Male stags leave their offspring with their mother until they mature - much like how Robert leaves his bastards with their mothers. It could be another small reference to Gendry's fate as the Royal stag that never knew his father but escaped the consequences of his father's death.

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore the battle for the Iron Throne is clearly inspired by the dynastic conflicts of the Lords and Royals of the British Isles. For example &amp;#39;The Black Dinner&amp;#39; of Scottish History and the Red Wedding (RIP Robb Stark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main conflict seems to resemble the War Of The Roses - the struggle between house York and House Lancaster for the English throne with different factions claiming their right through different previous rulers but in the end the only survivor is Henry Tudor - a man with very little claim. He&amp;#39;s our Gendry (who is a bastard) who sweeps in at the end of the war to overthrow the &amp;#39;mad&amp;#39; Richard III (Our Dany). Richard III is famous for killing off his own nephews (Our Jon Snow) who had a better and stronger claim than him. I think Game Of Thrones might end in a similar fashion to the War of The Roses as well. It ended with a reluctant marriage between Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York. This political marriage ended the conflict and brought the warring sides together. Elizabeth could be either Sansa or Arya with the latter being more likely. They are all that remains of House Stark and control the powerful North. A political marriage would cement Gendry&amp;#39;s position and stabilize the realm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This echoes back to the very first epsiode where Robert Baratheon insists upon Ned Stark that his son marry his daughter to unite the house. Presumably to stabilize the realm against what Robert sees as the rising Lannister influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another early show reference to Gendry could be seen, or rather not seen, when the Starks happen upon the dead (Royal) stag and direwolves that have killed each other. This is symbolic of Robert and Ned&amp;#39;s actions leading to both houses. Robert and Ned soon die. Each of the surviving cub direwolves suffer along with their respective Starks. However what is missing is the stag&amp;#39;s offspring. Male stags leave their offspring with their mother until they mature - much like how Robert leaves his bastards with their mothers. It could be another small reference to Gendry&amp;#39;s fate as the Royal stag that never knew his father but escaped the consequences of his father&amp;#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about this show and have come up with crazy theories that really never came true. That does not stop me from still trying to attempt what this show is basically about at its core. Based on the events that took place on the show last night it looks to me as though the show is trying to lead us down a dark but satisfying path. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night's episode was difficult to watch and I was like most not satisfied with the way the show dealt with the Cersei or Dany characters at the end. However, I do suppose it was cathartic for Cersei to be killed and crushed by the thing she thought she was better at then anyone. Symbolic in nature but as a viewer on the show I wanted to see her character suffer just a little bit more. The Arya story ark was more interesting to me because it was almost like watching a part of her die to be reborn a new. 

I think that in the finale there will be a sacrifice of love for the greater good. Most of this assumes that this leads to Jon killing Dany in the end. I think that the best and purest love on the show has been between Jon and Arya. One will have to sacrifice the other in order to end the darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

This maybe a stretch but the hug between Arya and Jon in Episode 1 of this season was meaningful because there is more than one kind of love. I potentially see the show miss leading the viewers showing Jon killing Dany only to have Arya remove the mask and reveal that she was the one to end both Dany (who we witness) and Jon who we won't see get killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, and after how the Jamie story line ended I can't see Jon betraying Dany in the end. I would hope that his character will embrace who he is and fill the prophecy and become the prince who was promised but it is looking more like the creators of the show have deemed Arya worthy of this.

&amp;#x200B;

""I am not a lady"" ""I have never been a lady"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I hope the finale is more satisfying than Cersei being allowed the benefit of dying with the one she loved. The Grey Worm &amp; Missandei deserved that ending not the brother and sister story line.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post contains spoilers from Season 8 Episode 5 so if you have not seen the episode please be advised that I discuss elements from the show below.&lt;/p&gt;

Dany is lost. She‚Äôs officially The Mad Storm-Born Mother of Chain Breaking Dragons and dark eye circles visually indicating she‚Äôs gone full coo-coo bird, the burner of landings, and the ruler of the seven kingdoms. For one episode.....

Arya races back to winterfell, on the pale horse, to warn Sansa an‚Äô dem. Bc I mean, what was the point of the horse? Here Arry, ride this horse around the corner to Jon and everyone quick. Even if she does, I still think she rides back to winterfell, especially Bc I think Sansa is the next Mark for Dany.

So Jon has to die again in some way, for my theory to work. Maybe Dany sentences Tyrion and Jon to death? Same as Varys? Regardless- they made a major push to reestablish how powerful Drogon is. One episode earlier we are wondering how Drogon will even get close, with all the arrows stationed all around KL and how easily they took down the other dragon in EP4. No sweat, straight Elio‚Äôs pizza‚Äôd KL and most people in it. 

So my thought is that they are clearly re-establishing the point of, how the fuck are you gonna beat Dany without a dragon, at least?

So maybe she kills Jon, he comes back...this time with the dragon Urine Greyjoy killed? 

Either way, there is def one more battle happening, Including Tormund, more wildlings, Ghost+ Arya‚Äôs Wolf and a bunch of others. Probably Theon‚Äôs sister too. 

Or maybe not- 
but I will say this has been fun as all hell, and I appreciate the show. No story telling will ever be perfect or completely satisfying to all but overall this show is my fav all time. It‚Äôs been really cool sharing with all of you. Mr. Martin has an incredible mind and imagination I could only dream of. Hopefully the spinoffs can keep us all going.

I‚Äôve convinced myself that Jon is in fact Robert Baratheons son not Raeghar Targaryens. My theory rests on admittedly shaky ground though but here are the main points that brought me to this conclusion. 

First part I felt I had to do was convince myself that Jon wasn‚Äôt a Targaryen. 

Been burned: check

No white hair: check

‚ÄúBut the dragon likes him!‚Äù Maybe but they are also smart like Tyrian said when he gained the other two dragons trust. They know who they can trust and who they can‚Äôt. Also if you‚Äôll remember that stare from Drogon when they rode the dragons to the secluded spot. That was not a comforting or trusting stare. It was one meant to intimidate. 

Then I had to convince myself that he was a Baratheon. This is where it‚Äôs somewhat shaky. It‚Äôs possible that before Lyanna Stark was kidnapped that she was impregnated by Robert. Also the Lord of light has been enthralled with Baratheon men. Renley, Gendry and now...Jon? 

Also why did Raeghar marry Lyanna in secret? If the Targaryens are really the ruthless, vindictive bunch they‚Äôre made out to be why not make the marriage of your enemy‚Äôs former lover to the prince a spectacle!? Especially if she is already pregnant with the princes child?! But Raeghar was supposedly kind. He married her because he did love her and the child might be his but he also knew it might be Robs and the only way to protect the child from his own families inquiry was to marry her. 

Then I had to work out Bran basically knowing everything. 

Except he doesn‚Äôt.

 He didn‚Äôt even know Raeghar and Lyanna we‚Äôre married until Samwell told him and confirmation bias prevented further trips to the past into the matter.

I don't think it's an irredeemable crime to make her do this, it's supposed to be a tragedy, and from high up on her dragon, all Dany sees is enemies, she doesn't have the street-eye view to know the horrors she's causing.

Still, if we look at every other arc moving forward in Episode 5, they all are extremely fitting for the character arcs.

**Varys** dies but he does so in keeping with what his character has always been about, sacrificing for the greater good, even at personal risk.

**Jaime** dies, and it's very sad in a way that he never was able to fully remove himself from his addiction to Cersei, but he embraced it in perhaps the most gut wrenching way possible to do everything he could to save her when nobody else in the world cared about her.

**Cersei** may be a bit of a stickler for the prophecy nuts out there, yes there was no backstabbing valonquar to take out the Queen, another red herring, another sign that prophecies in this world are just superstitious nonsense meant to lead us away from the reality. This episode managed to do what no other episode in 8 seasons could do, make us actually feel some kind of emotion other than hatred for Cersei. She's not redeemed, but we see everything get taken away from her, we see her stripped down the barest essence of herself, a scared woman who just wants to survive. In the last moments she has with Jaime we know what's coming and while we wanted her to die, and knew she would die, we actually felt bad about it to a degree, like ""not like this...""

**Tyrion** has a beautiful arc here too, where he says goodbye to his brother knowing no matter what comes next he will never see him again. We seem him owe up to selling out Varys in his final hour and the pain he feels when Varys does not condemn him for it. We see the pain he feels when Dany does the very thing that he begged her not to do, the very thing he convinced everyone else she would never do.

**Jon** has a crisis of conscience, we see his black and white view of the world crumbling around him. It's no longer about the Living vs. the Dead, it's now complicated as his own men run around butchering and raping innocents, and how his Queen is the cause of so much chaos and death. Jon is thoroughly broken here and the final repercussions for this event will clearly be felt next episode.

**The Hound** finally faces his brother, but not before showing us one last bastion of his humanity as he spares Arya from following in his doomed footsteps. The fight with his brother is every bit as epic as we hoped, with the decks clearly stacked against him, and how in his final act he knows he can only defeat his brother by sacrificing them both to the thing he fears most, the flames.

**Euron** dies. Thank God.

**Arya** once again seems to be the poster child for this season taking all the limelight, but this time for good purpose. As revealed in the behind-the-scenes feature, focusing on Arya as she tries to escape the city is a perfect way to give us a glimpse of the carnage and death that Daenerys is causing while giving us someone we're invested in to follow and not just random extras running about on fire.


Ultimately, we may not be happy with Daenerys arc, whether we feel it's due to bad writing or just because we hate this tragic mental break happening to one of our favorite characters, but without her Mad Queen moment, we would never have gotten such excellent stories and endings for so many other characters this episode, and I feel that we had to sacrifice our lovely Dragon Queen for the sake of the rest of the cast, and when weighed on that scale, I feel that giving her up for the rest is worth it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s no secret people (including the actress if some sources are believed) aren&amp;#39;t truly happy about Daenerys arc due to it&amp;#39;s sudden change at the end.

So here we go:

My first theory is that in the wake of the sack of King's Landing, after Daenerys sits on her throne, after she has become the new queen, amidst the rubble of the city she destroyed and the ashes of the innocent people she massacred, she will finally see what her destiny entailed. She sacrificed everything that made her who she was and brought her to Westeros, for that throne. And in the end, it was all for naught. Her closes allies are dead, her enemy is dead. She is left with absolutely nothing, and she is in the same position as she was when she began her journey. Afraid and alone. Except this time there is no destiny driving her. At this point, Jon or maybe even Tyrion will confront her. Possibly even both, since both kept faith and in doing so allowed her to massacre and destroy the city and its innocent people. In the confrontation, Daenerys dies as she has technically fulfilled her so-called destiny. I also like the theory that Arya might kill Dany. I also think Drogon is going to die. Either he dies  in the effort of securing the Iron Throne for Dany, which pretty much completes her loneliness and drives her to her end, or upon her request, he burns the Iron Throne down, melting it and ending the centuries long saga of war, death, and disease that symbol brought to the people of Westeros, and then dies after in a confrontation. He could also die along with Daenerys. After that, Jon and Tyrion together announce the end of the war, and decide to allow the seven kingdoms to rule as that, seven individual kingdoms with their over sovereign. No more Iron Throne, no more overarching ruler. Tyrion stays in King's Landing and begins efforts to repair the city, and continues on Varys's work to ensure everyone in the city, and the broader kingdom have hope for an actual better future.( It's his way of keeping Varys's memory alive considering he basically made the choice that led to Varys's execution and it was the wrong choice). Jon returns to Winterfell, but only for a short time, as he sets out to return to the true North. Gendry returns to Storm's End. Sansa stays as lady of Winterfell. Brienne remains there as well, in light of the news of Jaime's demise, she continues as she had before. A knight. She knights Podrick, who then commences on his own journey. Arya, the wandering warrior she is, also leaves though I think she might be going back North ( or even to Storm's End because after this, I think she is done fighting and killing. She's seen what revenge does. Maybe she helps in taking Dany down, but after she either goes home, goes to Gendry, or goes on the road defending people.)Bronn, as Tyrion promised gets Highgarden. The war eventually becomes a distant memory, another fable that the generations tell their children. Everyone who wanted anything with the Iron Throne is wiped out. Westeros rises from the ashes and continues on... the heroes and enemies of the past remain in the past, relegated to living on in Bran's conscience and the scrolls of the Citadel.... Winter ends.

&amp;#x200B;

My second theory is that like in the first Dany sits on her throne, realizes the truth, has Drogon burn it down, during confrontation dies (or she dies of despair, though I don't know if that is possible in GoT). Jon and Tyrion also die, thereby completely wiping out anyone who had anything to do with the Iron Throne. In the rubble, the city becomes a wasteland. Now only robbers, smugglers, and more of the sort roam in what was once the seat of the realm's greatest power. Everything reduced to ash and rubble. The other members of the Seven kingdoms, in the midst of the despair and tragedy create mutual peace and continue to rule their own kingdoms. Gendry again returns to Storm's End. Sansa stays in Winterfell, etc. Westeros lives on... the past remains in the past, only turning into legends and stories children are told in order to learn their lessons...Winter ends.

Possible endings for characters:

Grey Worm may or may not die. If he lives, he goes to Naath to live out the rest of his days.( The same is in the first theory) EDIT: Actually he's probably going to die at Jon's hands. 

If Brienne doesn't stay in Winterfell-- Sansa grants her freedom from her vow. She leaves, possibly going Arya, and they continue on to fight for others, for justice.

Podrick I think will get knighted either way (if not, he goes with Brienne, or stays in Winterfell in her stead and helps Sansa)

Sansa along with her duties in Winterfell, is the protectorate of the Vale. She teaches the young Arryn about ruling mercifully, but strategically.

Bron, in the case that Tyrion dies, goes to Essos and continues his fighting days, now in the pits, possibly. He looks back at his time in Westeros only seldomly.

&amp;#x200B;

A true ending:

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King fulfilled his purpose after all. In his death, the North with Danaerys march to King's Landing, destroy the city and the seat of power. They forever change the course of existence of man in Westeros. Westeros must rebuild from the ashes of this war of humans, meaning what it was in the past is finally gone. At the end, everything is the way it had to be. The Night King had to die for the Last War to take place. So he completed his own purpose as well.

&amp;#x200B;

AND, all of the great houses of the past are in someway gone. If Tyrion dies, the Lannisters are dead. If Dany and Jon die, the Targaryen name dies too. And the every living Stark is the end of their line as is. Really only the stag survived, and if Dany dies, the legitimacy of Gendry's official Baratheon name dies with her. The Tyrells are dead, so are the Martells, etc. Even if Jon, Tyrion, and Dany do not die, their names Targaryen and Lannister, and even Stark, will not define them anymore. Dany is pretty far gone as is. Jon would much rather go back to his identity in the beginning, Snow, and Tyrion would only think of the good of the future of the people, and not of the house name that caused him such agony in the past.

01. Arya and Dany dies.  
Arya is now on her way to kill Dany, everyone could see her anger growing on the episode 5. I think she will try to kill Dany, but Dany sees this beforehand and gets her killed. This makes Jon to kill Dany and after that he goes back to the North.  


02. Dany sentences Jon to die, but dies herself.  
In this theory, Dany sees Jon as betrayer/threat so she decides to kill Jon. I believe the reason for this would be that Jon asks Dany to give up the crown because she has become mad. This makes Dany angry so 'dracarys' happens, but Drogon would not do it. This I believe because of how Drogon looked at Jon when he kissed Dany at the North. Drogon goes and stands beside Jon and burns Dany instead. Fire can not kill a dragon, but dragon fire is a different thing.  


03. Arya and Jon kills Dany.  
Arya meet up with Jon and together they decide that Dany should not be the Queen. Arya wants to kill her, but Jon makes her not to. Another thing leads to another and they end up to situation, where they have no other choice but to kill Dany.

&amp;#x200B;

***Edit (here are the rest of my thoughts) (and spelling corrections):***

When the bells rang and we see the last closeup of Dany, I thought the expression looked like a mixture of relief and frustration. Like she was thinking that the war was over but Cersei rang the bells to save her own neck. Dany was going to fly to the Red Keep to deal with Cersei for the still-fresh Missandei death. She wouldn't need to fly anywhere to start torching random people and buildings.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that has been bothering me: **who rang the bells?** Tyrion told Jaime to get Cersei to ring the bells...but Jaime didn't do that. Cersei didn't give the order to ring the bells, nor did Qyburn. The scared soldiers were all frozen in place. They weren't retreating. The townspeople were standing around or hiding. But Bran would have time to warg into/control someone to ring the bells, then warg into Drogon to start the attack. The timing of the two events left enough spacing for Bran to do both. Let's go full-bore on this theory: The Hound DID die a few seasons ago. He too was brought back by the Lord of Light for two purposes: to ring the bell (which makes it look like Dany went crazy when Drogon attacks), and to keep Arya alive so she can kill Dany and fulfill the prophecy of forever shutting the eyes of someone with green eyes (a prophecy of Melisandre from the Lord of Light). Don't forget that Beric (a fire wight) also convinced The Hound to save Arya at the battle of Winterfell...more influence from the Lord of Light. When The Hound completed all of his tasks he was finally allowed to die. The Hound would have no reason to enter the Red Keep, ring the bell, and convince Arya to leave unless The Mountain was still alive. Do we really think Qyburn was able to reanimate someone? He had this magical power of reanimation...basically creating super-soldiers, and didn't make an entire army of them? Or did the Lord of Light bring The Mountain back too! **The Hound rang the bells and the Lord of Light was controlling him.

  Part 2:

In part, I hope the final twist has multiple facets. Several theories have explored Sansa‚Äôs tenuous relationship with Dany, and her potential to scheme for her cause‚Äî I won‚Äôt claim these theories as my own. Though, what if Sansa does have a larger role in the third and final twist? She‚Äôs been held captive by Cersei‚Äî and by extension, Joffrey; she‚Äôs been held captive by Littlefinger, by Ramsay. All, arguably, chaotic steps in the scheme of ascension on our ladder. Who better to learn from?

Sansa, as many have argued, very well could have had a hand in tipping off Cersei‚Äî again, I won‚Äôt take credit for this theory‚Äî though, good writing warrants that it wouldn‚Äôt have come from Sansa directly. Why not Varys and his little birds; the same little birds Qyburn may believe are entirely loyal to him after Varys‚Äôs exit from the capital. Sansa, now aware of how to play the ‚Äúgame‚Äù, tells Tyrion, a man she knows relatively well, with the capacity to understand that this knowledge will weigh on Tyrion, necessitating her predictable outcome: Tyrion telling Varys. Setting everything in motion.

Is it not interesting that the scene prior to Rhaegal‚Äôs death is a scene in which Varys speaks to Tyrion of treason? He‚Äôs a smart man, knowing he would need to be present for the ambush, justifying his actions, and putting himself in harm‚Äôs way, as an act ‚Äúnecessary for the realm‚Äù.

It‚Äôs entirely possible that Sansa is playing Cersei‚Äôs game, staying back and assembling an army, just as Cersei did for the ‚Äúgreat war‚Äù, using Jon‚Äôs lineage, and the North‚Äôs desire for independence and loyalty toward their King in the North, to march on King‚Äôs Landing and confront the dragon queen after Dany defeats Cersei by any means necessary. I don‚Äôt imagine Sansa wants the throne, though; like Frodo wanting to destroy the one ring for the good of Middle-Earth, Sansa, in my eyes, wants to destroy the throne, for the good of the realm, having seen firsthand what it can do to those that desire its power. 

Could this be why Weiss and Benioff wanted Arya to defeat the Night King? The Starks were always ‚Äúthe protagonists‚Äù, since the series premiere; and, honestly, their family has been through some pretty fucked up shit since‚Äî could they have wanted both Arya and Sansa, Ned‚Äôs daughters, to end the two greatest wars: the war with the Other, and the war for the throne?

In my eyes, Jon will ultimately understand Sansa's intent, and choose ‚Äúfamily‚Äù over honor, and, as everyone believes, will follow Maester Aemon‚Äôs footsteps by declining the throne and travelling north, understanding the need to finally ‚Äúbreak the wheel‚Äù. Though, why? It‚Äôs simple to assume Jon would want to travel north, to reunite with Ghost and Tormund, but we need this to wrap up neatly, right? If my original theory holds true, of Dany being stabbed in the heart with the dragon glass dagger, turning her into a reiteration of the Great Other, he will be compelled, once again, to selflessly guard the realms of men from her inevitable ‚Äúreturn‚Äù, thus providing a reason for his journey north.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My original theory: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/biwbc0/the_endgame/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/biwbc0/the_endgame/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Why would the Falcon care about the other creatures of the Earth when it soared so high above them? It was said that only a Dragon would be able to harm the Falcon. Dragons were things from stories, the Falcon thought to itself.

&amp;#x200B;

The Falcon fell in love with a Mockingbird with the most beautiful song. It was said the that The Mockingbird could sing songs that could enchant any other bird. This is how the small bird survived and stayed alive, by deceiving the other creatures with it's song.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mockingbird would fly everywhere, leading his friend Little Dove. Little Dove was innocent and young. The Mockingbird often told Little Bird stories and sang his song for Little Dove, she was slowly learning his ways. The Mockingbird sang an amazing song to Little Dove, it was about the future. Although Little Dove didn't understand the song, she knew that The Mockingbird had a great plan for the future. He was working towards something, his life's work.

&amp;#x200B;

The Falcon was filled with envy upon hearing The Mockingbird sing its beautiful song to Little Dove. The mighty Falcon began it's assault on the little bird, screeching and threatening the fragile creature. The Mockingbird sang one last song right into the ear of the Falcon, this knocked it unconscious, and it fell from the sky, dying when it's wings hit the ground. Little Dove thanked The Mockingbird for saving it from The Falcon. Before leaving the The Falcon The Mockingbird sung it's song to The Baby Falcon (The Falcon's child). Baby Falcon was small but The Mockingbird knew that The Falcon would grow into a powerful ally in time. An ally that The Mockingbird knew would  protect him when he pulled his greatest scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

A few seasons passed and Little Dove had grown quite a lot, even though Little Dove and The Mockingbird had been on many adventures together, defeating many enemies, she had grown tired of The Mockingbird's song. She wondered when the Mockingbird would use his song to get rid of her like he did to the Falcon. The Little dove bumped into, they Wolf and the Raven, they had been her friends since before she knew of the Mockingbird. Little Dove remembered something important by meeting them, that she had now wings and she was never a little bird. She remembered that the howl of a wolf was the music she needed, not the chirps of a deceitful bird who had been controlling her.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing his song's control of Little dove slip the Mockingbird attempted to sing his song to the Raven. However, the Raven was too intelligent. The Mockingbird's true colours were starting to show, he was a deceitful animal, fooling all the other creatures with his harmless appearance. The Mockingbird hatched a plan, gave the Raven a shiny object, he had heard stories that ravens were obsessed with objects that glisten and death. He knew that it was the Raven's nature to give these objects of power to a friend, like The Wolf.

&amp;#x200B;

Little Dove and The Wolf continued to howl at each other. One day *a mockingbird* hatched a nefarious scheme, it attempted to use it's song on Little Dove to get rid of The Wolf. Little dove knew The Mockingbird's ways was furious and bit a mockingbird's wing. The Wolf bit the bird's head and twisted it's neck. Little Dove was a wolf all along. The death of a mockingbird wasn't enough for The Raven, he would continue to obsess about death (until, of course, The Wolf uses the mysterious shiny object to defeat death itself).

&amp;#x200B;

Shitty story right?

Sorry for wasting your time.

&amp;#x200B;

But... Maybe one day I'll tell you about The Mockingbird's great plan in his song to Little Dove, the shiny object he gave The Raven and The Baby Falcon. Maybe that will shock you a bit. Or maybe I'll forget. Time will tell.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falcon was an elegant creature with no concerns in the world. Why would the Falcon care about the other creatures of the Earth when it soared so high above them? It was said that only a Dragon would be able to harm the Falcon. Dragons were things from stories, the Falcon thought to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falcon fell in love with a Mockingbird with the most beautiful song. It was said the that The Mockingbird could sing songs that could enchant any other bird. This is how the small bird survived and stayed alive, by deceiving the other creatures with it&amp;#39;s song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mockingbird would fly everywhere, leading his friend Little Dove. Little Dove was innocent and young. The Mockingbird often told Little Bird stories and sang his song for Little Dove, she was slowly learning his ways. The Mockingbird sang an amazing song to Little Dove, it was about the future. Although Little Dove didn&amp;#39;t understand the song, she knew that The Mockingbird had a great plan for the future. He was working towards something, his life&amp;#39;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falcon was filled with envy upon hearing The Mockingbird sing its beautiful song to Little Dove. The mighty Falcon began it&amp;#39;s assault on the little bird, screeching and threatening the fragile creature. The Mockingbird sang one last song right into the ear of the Falcon, this knocked it unconscious, and it fell from the sky, dying when it&amp;#39;s wings hit the ground. Little Dove thanked The Mockingbird for saving it from The Falcon. Before leaving the The Falcon The Mockingbird sung it&amp;#39;s song to The Baby Falcon (The Falcon&amp;#39;s child). Baby Falcon was small but The Mockingbird knew that The Falcon would grow into a powerful ally in time. An ally that The Mockingbird knew would  protect him when he pulled his greatest scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few seasons passed and Little Dove had grown quite a lot, even though Little Dove and The Mockingbird had been on many adventures together, defeating many enemies, she had grown tired of The Mockingbird&amp;#39;s song. She wondered when the Mockingbird would use his song to get rid of her like he did to the Falcon. The Little dove bumped into, they Wolf and the Raven, they had been her friends since before she knew of the Mockingbird. Little Dove remembered something important by meeting them, that she had now wings and she was never a little bird. She remembered that the howl of a wolf was the music she needed, not the chirps of a deceitful bird who had been controlling her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing his song&amp;#39;s control of Little dove slip the Mockingbird attempted to sing his song to the Raven. However, the Raven was too intelligent. The Mockingbird&amp;#39;s true colours were starting to show, he was a deceitful animal, fooling all the other creatures with his harmless appearance. The Mockingbird hatched a plan, gave the Raven a shiny object, he had heard stories that ravens were obsessed with objects that glisten and death. He knew that it was the Raven&amp;#39;s nature to give these objects of power to a friend, like The Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Dove and The Wolf continued to howl at each other. One day &lt;em&gt;a mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; hatched a nefarious scheme, it attempted to use it&amp;#39;s song on Little Dove to get rid of The Wolf. Little dove knew The Mockingbird&amp;#39;s ways was furious and bit a mockingbird&amp;#39;s wing. The Wolf bit the bird&amp;#39;s head and twisted it&amp;#39;s neck. Little Dove was a wolf all along. The death of a mockingbird wasn&amp;#39;t enough for The Raven, he would continue to obsess about death (until, of course, The Wolf uses the mysterious shiny object to defeat death itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shitty story right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... Maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll tell you about The Mockingbird&amp;#39;s great plan in his song to Little Dove, the shiny object he gave The Raven and The Baby Falcon. Maybe that will shock you a bit. Or maybe I&amp;#39;ll forget. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

Game of Thrones will be a big loop...

Tagaryens: Daenerys is slowly becoming the mad queen...you can see that in the recent expressions on her face. She will be killed by Jaime ""the king slayer"" who is running back to Cersei. I guess he will kill her because Daenerys will manage to kill Cersei...(Mad King and King Slayer loop). If she somehow manages to have a kid, his story will be the same as Daenerys with his parent killed and him being exiled (loop).

Baratheon: The bastard is now Lord and will be the rightful heir since John Snow will never say anything about him being a Targaryen. He will become naturally King of the Seven Kingdoms and will be a good king like his father. (Baratheon king loop)

Starks: Will become warden of the north again because they do not have that much interest in the south anyway and be friends with the south through the relation of Arya and Baratheon (Ned and Robert loop). 

Night King: Bran through the mark of the Night King will become the Night King himself (loop) and leave to the North

John Snow: Will miss too much the North and will lead the free folks to fight against Bran (like cousin Benji I guess...loop) or just hold the wall...

Lannisters: Tyrion/Jaime will some how have to pay the Lannister debts towards the Iron Bank and slowly rebuild their fortune. Maybe Cersei will also have her kid who will loop to kill the Starks...

Essentially we will be back at GOT Season 1...

Message could just be that despite having a common enemy humans are just not able to put aside their ego and that nothing will change hence the ""loop""

Other aspects not loop relevant:

Grey Worm: I guess he could give a good fight to Mountain since Sandor Clegane is just drunk and tired of life.

Religion: well just apparently irrelevant in this series despite multiple calls...

In the war between the Targaryens there was a wild dragon on Dragon stone called Cannibal. This dragon was wild and rider less and may have arrived on Dragon stone before Aegon the conqueror. I speculate that cannibal was the one that might have burned Hardhome in the north. However, when Aegon arrived Cannibal developed a taste for his own kind. 

After the war Cannibal vanished (not confirmed dead), may have headed back north to continue living in isolation (safety), but when (series version) Daenerys loses one of her dragons beyond the wall Cannibal follows the scent south. When a wounded Rhaegal now flies south to Kings Landing cannibal follows.

Is this what Euron sees coming, a Dragon whose age alone can give a good estimate of his size. 

The reason I like this theory is because ultimately Cannibal isn't on anyone's side and will most likely kill Drogon and level Kings landing if any of those scorpions are loosed in its general direction.

The Waif stabbed Arya in the stomach. It was one of my biggest Wtf moments in the series. https://youtu.be/HSABTw9Hre8

This is no throwaway wound. She was effectively dead before she recovered enough and then a few days later she ran into a dark room chased down by the Waif, still bleeding profusely.

After this scene, we are effectively told that Arya killed the Waif, came back to basically resign from the temple and JH just let her go even though she became an assassin without becoming Noone. This turn of events stunned me. I was in disbelief for months because the entire premise of the effective cost of her new training being nothing just didn't sit with everything we know about the Faceless Men. A part of me just held on to the belief that what if this is a long con? 

Then Arya went back to her list and I was like OK that's that. Back to Arya's journey. She kills Freys, stands by Sansa, reunites with Jon, jokes with Hound, flirts and sleeps with Gendry, cries over Beric, calls back to Not Today. And then eventually calls back to the fact that being a lady is not really me. 

A lot of this basically hits home the fact that this is Arya. Coz how can anyone feel /remember these things that she felt. 

The second punch in my gut is that she isn't just a regular assassin badass  during the battle but she actually effing kills the NK. By stabbing him in the stomach. Whoa what?!?! 

This could've been so poetic, folks. It could've been Noone who really killed Night King posing as Arya Stark. And the stab in the stomach was multi dimensionally meaningful all along. 

But they killed that possibility with all the emotional, personal scenes that stabbed that theory in the stomach.

I still hold on to a thread of hope since Arya did effectively talk a lot about herself with the Waif during training, giving away her Kill List, and the book says wearing a face makes you live that person as well. And the God of Death callback of Not Today won't be unknown to a Noone. But this is literally just a thread thats toooo frail and just wishful at this point. 

But gods, it could've been epic longcon. 

Argghhhhh :( :( :(

1 hour and 15 minutes into 805, I had realized and personally grieved this theory being officially fully dead (RIP) with Arya's scene with Sandor and her salvaging return to being human.
And then in the last 2 minutes they show her ride away on a pale horse and I wanna throw myself off the roof. Death rides the Pale Horse in the Apocalypse. Oh God. 

It's so far beyond a mass show plot point now that I'm confident this turn will never never happen, but why do they do this to me?????? :'(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very torn about this and have gotten repeatedly butchered for it by people, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

..Here is my theory for the ending of this whole rushed cut and dry season so far of Game of Thrones. (I agree with you Kit! Disappointing!) btw I think it is just stupid enough to be absolutely right...

Ok here we go... as Dany goes insane, butchering and murdering everyone who did or did not betray her, losing complete control of what was left of her senses. Very silly, very naive nephew Jon Snow actually tries to reason with Dany telling her he can‚Äôt accept this and saying ‚Äúumm Aunty.. you may have gone a little bit cray cray back there...‚Äù what he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know‚Äù though is that dear Aunty D. no longer gives a flip and instead Informs him that as Jon is the only true threat left to her throne she can‚Äôt allow him to live and then viciously stabs him! but wait! ...oops! Someone saw that! Wouldn‚Äôt happen to Ayra now would it? Yep... it was.. seeing another family member die at the hands of murderous queen she then throws that wonderful ‚Äúpointed out‚Äù weapon her Mr Lover Lover Gendry made out of WHAAAAT? Uh huh... you guessed it folks... Night Queen making Dragon glass.... oh dear... Drogon then of course smashes through the ceiling and screams fire at everyone while Arya drags Jons dead crow corpse behind a pillar to watch the dragon pick up Dear Aunty D. breaking long claw with his big feet before he flies away with her... 

DUN DUN DAAHHHHH! 

So here‚Äôs Ayra finally letting go of all the emotions she‚Äôs been holding in for so long over Jon‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour Deadness‚Äù when along comes Sir Davos swinging his sword only to stop and see the destroyed throne room and asking ‚Äúwhat in the gods names happened in here?!?‚Äù That‚Äôs when Arya holds up old dead crow in her catatonic state and asks Davos in a very blubbery voice to please fix him.

Scratching his head Davos having lived with the witch burning crazies of yester year says ‚ÄúScrew it.. sure thing little lady, I‚Äôll give it a go‚Äù then with hands outstretched begins the primal chanting of what sounds like something from an album of Gregorian... and WHAMMO! Jon starts breathing a second time! (People keep making him forget how too üôÑ) and Arya is so pleased she waves Sansa over to witness the miracle and then a whole bunch of other winterfell winners appear because its as the trolls would say Hug Time! ü§ó 

Then of course Brainy Bran still going through his Mysterious stage of weird pupating ruins the mood by saying to Jon ‚Äúyou idiots just made another white walker.. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and she has another dragon...might want to get on that..‚Äù

So they start going through stages of grief by panicking then preparing then panicking again all while Queen Dread Walker finds her freshly frozen feet and finishes off poor old dying Drogon with a Ice spear of her own making.

Meanwhile in kings landing they are making a huge glass covered spear for the dragon killing ballista left at their disposal with only one shot at killing Drogons undeadidness while they scramble to set the bodies that hit the floor on fire üî• but very soon it‚Äôs too late... Queen Dany the Dreads winter is here and once again the Starks face off with the long night.

I do believe that dear old Drogon will go down at some point with that balista, (Cmon... let it be Bron!) but not straight away because heeeerrrees Dany! and her friendly falling army of wights! Who start attacking kings landing, leaving her to go on a slow walk through the castle with one true purpose in mind. ‚ÄúBreak the wheel, break the throne, break the wheel, break the throne‚Äù but when she gets to throne room she finds a newly invigorated Snowy brought back by the lord of light to face the final threat. Dear Dead Lover Aunty D.  Who is as pissed as the fiery mouth of her last dragon!! 

‚Äú...naughty nephew!‚Äù She thinks ‚ÄúNow you must Die!

.....ummm.. Again! 

..So they fight she shows once again she‚Äôs immune to fire blah blah blah calls Drogon to start smashing through the ceiling again where he blasts the throne with fire...  finally melting the ugly thing but Snowy has put two and two together and reaches into that fire while saying ‚ÄúA-Ha!‚Äù I know what you are allergic too!‚Äù This broken sword (aka lightbringer) that came out of the iron throne you just melted with dragon fire!‚Äù Look Aunty D. !! I can take the heat just like you!! Mwhahaha!‚Äù And then stabs her! 

WHAAAAAAAAA! 

The dead all die finally as we hear Donkey singing..,

‚ÄúThe sun will come out! Tomorrow! Bet your bottom...I‚Äôm comin Elizabeth!!‚Äù as Jon watches the dawn breaking over the sea.

Now this part gets murkey... I would like it if snowy retired himself from society to go back and live in the north but more then likely to finish loose ends this is the part when Jon having finished his purpose finally dies. Which only leaves Sansa and Arya to figure shit out. 

I do believe Sansa will rule the 7 kingdoms. She won‚Äôt do it at kings landing however. Everyone agreeing to abandon this shitty place and its ugly hunk of metal she will create her own queens council out of whatever is left such as brieanne and Davos etc... While Gendry become the new Lord in the North and Ayra is left to either complete work for Sansa or just do what she‚Äôs always done. Whatever she likes. 

Sams going to take back his fathers lands and chronical this whole saga while Bran.. 

... now bran I think is going to somehow return to the north and take up residence in a new weirwood tree like his previous counter part and then he‚Äôs going to warg somehow into the past and become the ever so famous and profusely mentioned Bran the Builder.

Every sub location they show is significant in a big way. Last hearth, Winterfell battlements, Godswood , Winterfell halls, Winterfell crypts, KL gates (the parley that ends with Missandei beheading), KL city, ""Red Keep towers"" and Map Room that's prominently visible in the backgrkund, Scorpion aimed at dragon, ending with the throne room. And there's a bit of Isle of Faces in the background.

So it is telling us that the next mega developments are the two sub locations we haven't seen so far. Cersei /Jaime's fall from the tower (onto the map) and Daenerys's fate (dying?) in the throne room.

And I believe the Bran flashbacks will focus on Isle of Faces and will tie it all together.

Lastly - in keeping with this, I think the scroll bits also tell us the story.

The two prominent ones are Red Wedding and Azor Ahai / Mother of Dragons.

I have a sinking feeling that Red Wedding will come a full circle with the last Stark (Sansa) betraying the last Lannister (Tyrion). I would be heartbroken but that's GOT for you. I'm bracing myself. There's something that'll happen between the two. Either a literal wedding like the Yorks and Lancaster joining of houses or this tragedy. 

And the Azor Ahai prophecy might come to play with Jon at the cost of the Mother of Dragons who ends up being his Nissa Nissa (might be literal or figurative) because of some historical cycle of the Long Night that Bran explains?

I think it was to remind Daenerys of what happened when Daenerys freed Missandei and freed the slaves of Astapor and Missandei, by double-crossing the slave master who owned them.

Daenerys was trying to negotiate the purchase of an Unsullied army, but the slave master didn't know Valyrian was her mother tongue., so he kept insulting her, while Missandei tried her best to ""translate"" his words to her.

When Daenerys told him she had three dragons, he finally took her seriously.

He wanted all three dragons in trade for the 8000 Unsullied.

She said one.

He replied two dragons.

She replied one.

He finally said one.

They had a deal.

When the trade went down, she gave him the dragon, and he gave her the slavemaster whip. And the Unsullied would follow any orders if she held it.

She ordered the Unsullied to march and halt.

The slavemaster was having trouble with controlling Drogon via chain so he tells Missandei to tell Daenerys:

""Tell the bitch her beast won't come"".

Daenerys then reveals that she understood him this whole time by speaking in Valyrian:

""A dragon is not a slave"".

She then orders the Unsullied to kill all the slavemasters and soldiers, but to harm no child.

And to strike the chains off all slaves they see.

The slavemaster then tells the Unsullied that he is their master and to kill Daenerys, which fails.

""Kill her. Kill her. Kill her!""

Daenerys then says ""Dracarys"", and Drogon sets him on fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Missandei could be trying to communicate that Daenerys could make a similar deal in order to ""secure peace between King's Landing and the North"". And then double-cross Cersei by having the dragon kill her and her army. Like a really terrifying Trojan Horse.

She didn't get her elephants, but maybe a dragon would please her or at least peak her interest.

There is also another way, by approaching the Iron Bank, yet that is less likely considering the Golden Company is already stationed outside King's Landing to fight the Northern army.

According to the trailer there appears to be another hostage taken by Cersei.

Some say it might be Jaime Lannister, but it could also be Varys for all we know. He wanted to help Jon Snow, but he could do that by reaching out to Cersei and attempting to pull a ""Grand Maester Pycelle"", some kind of move letting the Northern army into King's Landing just like Pycelle advised the Mad King to open the gates for Tywin and his army.

Cersei would probably survive somehow, be either out of range or something, considering the prophecy about her being strangled to death by the Valonqar.

Now we don't know the family line of Varys, but I still haven't figured out why he is obsessed with washing his hands. If he also was a Targaryen forced to live in poverty, much like Daenerys and her brother, perhaps even a Targaryen bastard, then perhaps the voice in the fire told the second grade warlock who cut him how Varys would die.

This is a theory I have read on here and I came to myself during the battle of the bastards when arrows were raining down on Jon Snow and everyone around him was dying but he seemed fairly safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Both Jon Snow and Dany have been set up to possibly be Azor Ahai at this point and we don't know which. Both are the third born and seem to have fate on their side. Jon seems to be more likely at this point because Dany is more prone to fall in love and as Aemon said, love is the rejection of duty and what is duty compared to the love for your children. Let's just say Jon is the chosen one right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, this sets up an interesting dynamic coming to the end of the story as that would make Jon the champion of light and Bran the Champion of Ice or the north. This means that Bran and Jon are not on the same side which Bran knows but Jon doesn't. Bran sent the ravens to Cersei and has been the spy all along. That's what Bran was doing during the battle of Winterfell and that's why it showed Bran worging into the ravens and flying past the battle.

&amp;#x200B;

Bran wants Dany and Jon to lose the war because he is fighting on the side of a different God. This brings Arya's role as the champion of the many faced God who appeared in human form as Jaqen into light. Arya became the champion of the many faced God after she killed Waif. This is when Jaqen said she was now no one. The interesting thing is that the faceless men and the many faced god religion started by valerian slaves and were accepted in Bravos because of their hate for Valeria.

&amp;#x200B;

This is interesting because the identity of Jon Snow is now being revealed to the world that he is Valerian nobility. This may mean that Arya may be against Jon as well now.

&amp;#x200B;

This also brings  up an interesting dynamic where, at the start of this season we thought the odds were heavily stacked in the favor of Jon and Dany to win the iron throne. If you look at it through the lens of the Gods, Cersei (the seven) and Euron (drowned God) are going up against Jon and Dany (R'hllor). Arya (the many faced God) isn't on a side but but the many faced God doesn't like Valerians.

&amp;#x200B;

The Old Gods and R'hllor clearly don't get along either. In the books, Melisandre tries to get wildlings to burn weirwood branches to show loyalty to R'hllor. Bran has more or less been brainwashed by the Old Gods (maybe took human form as the three eyed raven) and only shown visions to get him to help them and not other points of view and now Bran is working on behalf of the old gods not trying to save the world.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is likely that the Game of Thrones actually refers to a game between the Gods who then choose humans to fight for them.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because the identity of Jon Snow is now being revealed to the world that he is Valerian nobility. This may mean that Arya may be against Jon as well now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also brings  up an interesting dynamic where, at the start of this season we thought the odds were heavily stacked in the favor of Jon and Dany to win the iron throne. If you look at it through the lens of the Gods, Cersei (the seven) and Euron (drowned God) are going up against Jon and Dany (R&amp;#39;hllor). Arya (the many faced God) isn&amp;#39;t on a side but but the many faced God doesn&amp;#39;t like Valerians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Gods and R&amp;#39;hllor clearly don&amp;#39;t get along either. In the books, Melisandre tries to get wildlings to burn weirwood branches to show loyalty to R&amp;#39;hllor. Bran has more or less been brainwashed by the Old Gods (maybe took human form as the three eyed raven) and only shown visions to get him to help them and not other points of view and now Bran is working on behalf of the old gods not trying to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Ok in regards to game of thrones theories heres me and my mates shot at it. I believe that everyone is right there will be another dragon introduced in the next episode of Game Of Thrones but not a dragon as we know it. The big reveal will be the revelation of another Targaryen, most notably Tyrion who was the product of the rape of Joanna Lannister by Aegon Targaryen. This has long been speculated especially by Aegons hand of the king Tywin Lannister. 

Charles Dance seems to be doing alot of work promoting Games of Thrones lately meaning he still has a part to play possibly a flash back scene via Bran Stark showing Tyrions conception and birth. Why would Tyrion keep him alive....simple its all about the Game of thrones and power. Tywin knew that Tyrion was the real heir to the throne and if found out the Lannisters would still have a part to play in his reign...he did raise him after all.

Now with the reveal of Tyrions lineage he will be the true heir to the throne. He is Aegons first born son and the main heir NOT JON SNOW. Furthermore if Tyrion is King then that will automatically make his nephew Jon Snow a prince.....this will literally make him the prince that was promised. Think of the 3 headed dragon theory....Jon, Dany and Tyrion.

Jon is travelling with Davos Seaworth who has in possession the sword lightbringer that he got from Stanis Baratheon. Once Jon comes across this sword he will be able to wield it showing that he is Azor Ahai. However before he does this he will have to kill the one he loves being Dany. Jon will at some point believe he will have to kill her as she will slowly develop into the mad queen.

Game of thrones has a habit of leaving clues about things so why did they all of a sudden go back to Tyrion and Sansas relationship in the battle of Winterfell. Why go back to that? They are trying to build up the ending here. If Tyrion is king then Sansa is automatically queen because they are still married. This will connect the north and south. This is the bittersweet ending we have been told about. The two characters that have went through some awful things throughout the whole show have finally ended up on the throne. Sansa and Tyrion have been underdogs from day one but their character development throughout has been building for them to win the game of thrones. With Jon snow ending the show riding of into the sunset...most notably heading up north beyond the wall to live the rest of his days with Tormund, Ghost and the Wildings.

I think we are in for a massive bloodbath moment. Picture a room with Cersei and the mountain and her hand. The hand has been getting alot of screen time lately despite only getting a few scenes over the past two series. I reckon they are setting this up for Arya to take his face , pretend to be the hand and try to kill Cersei. However she gets caught by the mountain he kills the hand only for it to be revealed to Arya. The writers have built her up as a hero, invincible for killing the night king....this will be a massive moment for fans. At this point Cersei runs when the hound turns up and from here we have Clegane bowl whereby the hound kills the mountain and then dies himself from his injuries. Jamie meets Cersei and kills her knowing that if she gets captured she will be butchered by the enemy therefore it has to be him to kill her....then he kills himself. George R.R. Martin stated he takes his influence from Shakespeare amongst other things....this will be a Romeo and Juliet moment.

Anyway my theory ends up with it being the usual Game of Thrones bloodbath with Tyrion and Sansa as King and Queen, Bran as warden of the north being Ned Starks last male heir and Jon Snow riding of into the sunset.

Most of the focus seems to be on Jon and Dany. I believe that Sansa will reveal her true intentions and make her play, for the iron throne.   


Sansa has been a part of the game for a very long time. Some of the people she has spent alot of time with are arguably the best players of the game. In Season 7 we hear Tyrion say ""she's smarter than she leads on"". This season we hear Arya say ""she's the smartest person I've ever met"". The show keeps telling us that Sansa is smarter than we think, but why?   


I believe the biggest twist this season will come from her. I have been feeling this for a while. I kept thinking about where Sans's story could go. Most people think that she just wants to rule the North and for it to be independent but what if Sansa wanted more? Season 8 episode 4 made things a little more clear for me. Sansa seems to have taken the role of littlefinger. A new and improved one. I believe that she probably had a hand in most of the recent events that took place and she is slowly but surely climbing up the chaos ladder. One of her plays might have been telling Lord Glover to stay in  Deepwood Motte so when the time comes to ride south, Sansa will have a fresh and loyal army at her back. Lord Glover already expressed to Sansa how they should have chose her to rule instead of Jon. Also the first couple of episode showed Sansa having many conversations with Lord Royce but then he just vanished. Could Sansa have sent him on a separate mission to possibly have the Vale fight for her again as well? Hopefully this will make Sansa scenes in season 7  easier to swallow and make sense.   


Now you might need your tin foil hats for this one so bare with me. What if Sansa was the one who let Cersei know that Dany and her dragons will be at Dragonstone soon? Her plan would be to make Dany suffer a major loss and that would even the odds between Cersei and Dany so a victor is not clear. Sansa can then come to the capital with her armies and make her claim or demand for the throne. (I probably sound crazy). In the case of Cersei dying, that would make the final batte between Sansa and Dany. Jon will have to choose ""between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other).

Arya, Jaime and Hound go to King's Landing and the Hound will fight the Mountain (as per Brans vision in the first book) whilst Arya attempts to kill Cersei. The Hound loses and is on the floor dying, Jaime is hurt too and Arya cuts through the king's guard but before killing Cersei the Mountain steps up and starts killing Arya. The Hounds love of Arya motivated him to get up and defeat Mountain. Jaime has stood by watching all this and at the end chokes Cersei but she poisons him with a kiss and they die in each others arms. 

Are the faceless men still coming after Arya for desertion? If so I think she'll welcome Jacqin (death) whose waiting in King's Landing with open arms now her list is complete.

Varys dies as Melisande predicted. 

Bran is going to look back further than he ever has to discover that the man who turned into the night king was a stark (or Targeryan but apparently they weren't in Westeros at this time). Then he falls down the stairs or permanently becomes a Raven but doesn't survive. 

I don't know if he'll choose it  or have it thrust upon him, but I think for some reason someone (maybe Sansa) will stab Jon in the heart with dragonglass and since he's a Stark he transforms into a night king. The reason for this could be to defeat Cersei's army or to defeat a power-crazed Danys fiery escapades. Either way he'll resurrect a bunch of our favourite hero's, bring balance to the force then bugger off up north to be true king of the North and give Ghost a hug.  This night king is created out of love and will be a protector rather than a destroyer of men. Also he'll do the arm raising thing to raise people from the dead as a parallel to him seeing it 3 times himself. 

Gendry gets the throne (although the title or the general role of leadership rather than the throne itself which should get destroyed) and rebuilds like the good Baratheon smith he is. 

I also hope Nymerias wolf pack help out somehow and that the dragon skull (Balerion?) now randomly shown in the title is reanimated. They showed the crypts of winterfell for the first time in the opening credits this season and they were very relevant so it's plausible. 

Yara (Asha) destroy Eurons fleet and Euron who will flee when they see they're losing. 

Sansa is warden/queen of the North depending how Gendry devolves power.

Bronn and Tyrion interact somehow, maybe retire as friends, I have no idea. No idea about Davos.  

Finally, I don't really know with Dany, she can't have the throne but after that it's your guess. Maybe she dies and goes off with Jon as a happy Wight to fulfil her promise to protect the realm. 

Lord of light azor ahai etc. won't be explicitly explained, which is good as religious beliefs in real life remain open to interpretation.

Obviously we know the showrunners and GRRM love misdirection and surprises.  They've tried to set up some obvious conclusions for several characters.  Jamie is supposed to kill Cersie.  The hound is supposed to kill the mountain. Jon is supposed to kill Dany (or visa versa).  We have to assume that some of these ""ideal"" conclusions will happen, and some won't.  

I'd like to focus on Jamie, Cersie, the Hound and the Mountain specifically.  Thier four characters all seem to be headed toward an intersection.  With Jamie, the show very much wants us to believe he ""left"" sweet hero Brienne to go back to his toxic ex.  That his love for his sister outweighs his newfound sense of morality.  I believe that after the discussion with Bron, Jamie thinks that she is finally lost.  If she would be willing to put a bounty on him, the love of her life, she is beyond saving, and it's his duty to stop her.  So I do think Jamie will attempt to assassinate Cersie.  I do believe Jamie has crossed a moral point of no return, and so his intentions of leaving brienne were connected to duty, not loyalty to cersie.  After all, he chose duty over loyalty to the crown when he killed the mad king.  Unfortunately for Jamie the mountain will kill Jamie for his troubles.  The redeemed knight does not get his story book ending.  That's why brienne was crying so hard...she will not see him again.

So what does this mean for the valonquar prophecy?  Jamie is not the Valonquar.  Euron is a ""little brother"", so it can be him but then you'd have to believe he survives the sea dragon battle.  I don't.  It could be Tyrion, but that's too obvious and another misdirection.  But the Hound.  The Hound is the mountain's little brother.  They will meet, and most likely, cersie will be right there.

After Cersie has sacrifieced everything...her subjects, her children, her family, in her lust for power. Her final sacrifice will be killing Jamie, her love.  Her biological better half.  Her humanity.  Tyrion said in episode 4, he didn't think she was a monster, because of the way she loved her children.  This act proves, she only loves power, and she IS a monster.  More dangerous to the fate of the realm than the night king, or the mad king.

After the war is won, the contingent from the north enters the throne room.  Cersie sits, pale, sick, drunk, yet defiant...on the iron throne.  The mountain, menacing and emotionless, by her side.  She will demand a trial by combat.  The hound will be among the group, and the clegane bowl will commence.  The hound will win and approach the iron throne...

..and the ""the valonqar shall wrap his hands about &lt;Cersie's&gt; pale white throat and choke the life from &lt;her&gt;.""

So there it is.  I know that the ""Hound as the Valonquar"" is not new, but not aware that anyone had found the Jamie connection/misdirection and fully played it out.

Additional forces arrive from Dorne, Iron Islands, maybe even Edmure and the Riverlands.

Cersei realizes she is screwed and wants to burn them all, but Jamie is there with her, finds out she lost the baby a while back and is instead lying to him and Euron, and becomes Queenslayer but dies in the process as the Wildfyre destroys part of the Red Keep but he prevents it from destroying the rest of KL.

Clegane Bowl happens, and Hound must face the Wildfyre to beat his brother, but Hound is mortally wounded in the process and this time Arya ends his pain, House of Black and White style. 

Dany goes nuts, so do the Unsullied and Grayworm. Tyrion, Jon and Varys try to stop her but can‚Äôt. Varys is killed, Tyrion and Jon taken prisoner.

End of Episode 5

Then in the next Episode we see the aftermath and destruction. Dany is no longer listening to Jon and Tyrion. Grayworm is her only trusted advisor left. She has always been a conqueror, not a good ruler, as evidenced by Slavers Bay and Daario explaining it to her. She is prepared to kill Jon and Tyrion, and to use Drogon to keep everyone in line. She orders Grayworm to kill Jon, accusing him of lying about who he is in an effort to steal her throne. But... SURPRISE, Arya has killed Grayworm and kills Dany using his face. Drogon kills Arya is return.

Jon is horrified, but he is able, with the help of Brans warg powers, to stop Drogon from going nuts.  He refuses the throne, says that Tyrion and Sansa should rule, along with all of the other kingdoms in a large UN type council, and elections. 

Series ends with Jon saying his goodbyes, hoping on Drogons back, and taking the last dragon to the only place he knows of in the world where strange beasts like giants, ice spiders, Thenns, and other crap are accepted, the far North beyond the Wall.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden Company works for Iron Bank, not Cersei, and Iron Bank decides to back Dany and Jon instead of Cersei at last minute, disabling the Scorpions except in the Red Keep where Cersei is holed up with Qyburn, Mountain, her Queensguard, and Lannister forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional forces arrive from Dorne, Iron Islands, maybe even Edmure and the Riverlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cersei realizes she is screwed and wants to burn them all, but Jamie is there with her, finds out she lost the baby a while back and is instead lying to him and Euron, and becomes Queenslayer but dies in the process as the Wildfyre destroys part of the Red Keep but he prevents it from destroying the rest of KL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clegane Bowl happens, and Hound must face the Wildfyre to beat his brother, but Hound is mortally wounded in the process and this time Arya ends his pain, House of Black and White style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany goes nuts, so do the Unsullied and Grayworm. Tyrion, Jon and Varys try to stop her but can‚Äôt. Varys is killed, Tyrion and Jon taken prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of Episode 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the next Episode we see the aftermath and destruction. Dany is no longer listening to Jon and Tyrion. Grayworm is her only trusted advisor left. She has always been a conqueror, not a good ruler, as evidenced by Slavers Bay and Daario explaining it to her. She is prepared to kill Jon and Tyrion, and to use Drogon to keep everyone in line. She orders Grayworm to kill Jon, accusing him of lying about who he is in an effort to steal her throne. But... SURPRISE, Arya has killed Grayworm and kills Dany using his face. Drogon kills Arya is return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon is horrified, but he is able, with the help of Brans warg powers, to stop Drogon from going nuts.  He refuses the throne, says that Tyrion and Sansa should rule, along with all of the other kingdoms in a large UN type council, and elections. &lt;/p&gt;

Dany will threaten Tyrion but end up executing Varys. Kicks the Lannisters and Golden company's ass. Cersei sets off wildfyre and people think its Dany and Drogon. Jamie kills Euron and Hound kills Mountain, both mortally wounded. Arya puts hound out of his misery and kills Cersei. Jon kills Dany and Bran ends up king. 

I reckon Dany goes back to Dragonstone and confronts/threatens Tyrion, blaming him for Missandei's death. In a desperate attempt to save his own skin he will throw Varys under the bus who will burn for his treason. Varys will have set something in motion for Jon already or give a big speech proclaiming who he is to totally piss off Dany.

Everyone turns up at KL and battle starts. Dany goes full warrior princess and burns the shit out of everything. Euron fires some bolts and thinks he's hit Drogon (possibly armoured from Gendry) only to see him come through the clouds to Dracarys the ships. Yara mops up the rest, Euron swims to shore, Dany moves on to KL. 

Dany continues to kick the Lannister's ass, the army gets in and a fight with the Golden company ensues. Grey Worm goes super saiyan and is unstoppable. Cersei foreseeing the potential loss, triggers the wildfyre and folk think it was Dany. 

Jaime, the Hound and Arya end up together in the red keep. They come upon Cersei, Qyburn and the Mountain. Jaime reasons with Cersei to surrender (thinks shes carrying his child) and clegane bowl starts. Euron appears and we have a who's the daddy Jeremy Kyle situation. Jaime kills euron but is injured, Hound beats Mountain but is also injured. Arya puts Hound out of his misery this time. Jamie sees Arya and grabs Cersei, gives arya a nod who will kill them both, needle through the 2.

After the battle Dany will either summon Sansa for being a traitor or Tyrion will have betrayed her somehow during the battle. Whoever the traitor is will be sentenced to burn. Jon tries to reason with her but between Varys, this and thinking she burned the whole city he chooses to kill Dany to 'save the realm'. 

Jon refuses the throne and buggers up North (he better clap that bloody wolf). Bran the PTWP is elected king, as he can live in the past and ensure past mistakes are not repeated. Sansa rules the North. Arya goes west of Westeros. Starks rule.

I also reckon Bran will warg a dragon. This new prince of Dorne will show up in some capacity (who even is it?) Ghost and/or Nymeria show up (a hope more than anything). Dunno how that would fit in though.

1 half where you pay attention to the dialogue(What they say not what they do)

1 half where you pay attention to the Visuals(what they do not what they say)

&amp;#x200B;

but why?

George of course

So George created littlefinger

therefore George is littlefinger &amp; can think like him

he has been playing D&amp;D/HBO/&amp; non book readers but who are obsessed with Game of thrones

To buy all his books or at least read the entire story properly and understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

here is how

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Be George

\&gt;Create an amazing fantasy world with a cult like following &amp; sells loads of books

\&gt;Books get turned into a TV show

\&gt;Make lots of money!!

\&gt;TV Show becomes Big

\&gt;Haven't finished books

\&gt;tell everyone you'd have the books finished for the TV Show

\&gt;Never intend to release books until TV show is finished

\&gt;Write other books instead

\&gt;Make LOTS OF MONEY!!!!

\&gt;Realise they butchered your story on the TV Show and they're out of source material

\&gt;Lie and tell them you haven't finished the books yet

\&gt;Drip feed them plot points because you hold all the cards

&amp;#x200B;

Now it forces D&amp;D have to come up with good dialogue

&amp; he knows they can't 

so they have to put lots of money into CGI and cool looking shit to mask the fact they can't write

which Makes the show even bigger because it's a cinematic masterpiece now

All to mask the lack of Georges writing.(Also the climax of the story itself. Big battles, Dragons &amp; Castles ect)

now it's 2019 &amp; the Last season of TV Show. now the Biggest show on the planet with so much hype that D&amp;D have to live up to.

&amp; he knows it's not going to live up to the expectation that was set from the foundation of the show(first 4 seasons)

 

The Story is going to end in a certain way which it wont really make sense in the big picture. 

it will just finish the main story and leave everything else unexplained

Because George never wanted them to tell the story their way

he wanted it told his way, with his story.

so he just deprived them of what they needed most

Him and his writing

&amp;#x200B;

So now

\&gt;Show finishes &amp; fans will be confused and disappointed. people that just like action will think it was the tits

\&gt;People who were fans but are confused will want to go read the books because of the bad ending

\&gt;Release last 2 books that you've been working on for like 8/9 years 

\&gt;Get everyone to buy the books to understand the story properly

\&gt;Make LOTS OF MONEY!!!

\&gt;loads of Spin off shows forever that he will always get paid for 

&amp;#x200B;

He is the Drowned God

He is the Old Gods

he is the Seven

He is the Many Faced God

He is the Lord of Light

He is littlefinger

he created all this chaos to climb the ladder to the top and drop his books upon the earth .

However, just like with the Viper, right when we think the Mountain has been reduced to rubble, he fatally wounds Arya. Seeing this, the Hound taps into his inner Hulk and kills the Mountain, but not before being fatally wounded as well. 

In his last moments, the little brother and winner of Cleganebowl finds Cersei still crying over the death of Jamie and chokes her to death. Cue emotional conversation between the Hound and Arya as whatever building they are in collapses around them.

Who has been doing sacrifices this whole time? The only one? Melisandre.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally don't believe that the ""prince that was promised"" is the same person as Azor Ahai.  There are many legends that may or may not intertwine in GOT, such as the stallion that mounts the world and the last hero.

&amp;#x200B;

**Forging lightbringer:**

Lightbringer was never a sword, it is an army capable of defeating the great other.  First Melisandre attempts to build this through Stannis's army.  She ""sacrifices"" the statues of the seven, but it isn't enough.  Stannis's army breaks on the Blackwater.

&amp;#x200B;

She realizes that she needs a greater sacrifice, which is Shireen Baratheon (not a lion, but a stag, okay).  The importance of the second sacrifice is that it is a greater sacrifice, but not an ultimate sacrifice.  Stannis's army breaks a second time, most from desertion after seeing Stannis burn his own daughter, and the rest die at winterfell.

&amp;#x200B;

Melisandre becomes lost and begins her greatest toil.  She gets Jon and Dany together to build the greatest army Westeros has ever seen.  She lights the Dothraki arakhs on fire while asking Jorah to tell them to raise their **swords**.  She lights the pit on fire. She encourages Arya to kill the Night King.  She sacrifices herself (a priestess of the lord of light) as the ultimate sacrifice to fight the undead.  No part of the prophesy says that Azor Ahai is the one to land the killing blow to the Night King.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible Spoilers:  &lt;/p&gt;

Dany and Jon square off over her apparent wanton destruction of so many innocents, with Jon learning the truth too late as Dany dies in his arms. A somber Jon ends up ruling as King, electing to allow each separate kingdom political autonomy under a relative form of limited self-determination that resembles the early British parlimentary system. Sansa, Gendry, and Tyrion rule the North, Stormlands, and Westerlands, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

I posted this in [r/asoiaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf) and I'll post it here. I'm pretty excited about it and I think it makes a lot of sense and will tie together pretty much all the threads of the story. One thing you'll need to keep in mind is the look on Euron's face at the end of next weeks previews... Now for the theory.

And it starts with Dany's dead dragon. I remember back in the earlier seasons you'd have to burn each dead man, even when there wasn't a necromancer around. There was some *miasma* which permeated the wall. It's possible that when the wall fell this *miasma* spilled into the south. The magic in the wall may have been the only thing keeping the miasma at bay.

I feel like at the end of the previews for next week, Euron is seeing an undead Rhaegal and the army of the dead has descended south (and killed everyone at winterfell, undead Sansa with her blue eyes will be the Ice Queen, with eyes that Arya will have to shut forever. This would thematically fit as well. Both armies at the peak of their anger towards one another have no choice but to look north and fight.

Jamie will come back down and when cersei says no to joining forces with Jon and Dany's army, he will kill her. Arya and the hound will sneak into kings landing and do some sneaky stuff as well.

EDIT: Ok, to expand on this...

(1) - Jamie killing Cersei is his ""role"". He is a kingslayer. He saved Kings Landing from fire, now he will save it from ice.

(2) - the Weirwoods are spreading the miasma. They are the children of the forest and the miasma is their ultimate revenge. The north will have to give up their old gods and destroy the trees which leads me to....

(3) - Dany will sacrifice herself for Jon. In a way this will represent the Targaryen lineage giving up their throne. Both the Starks and the Targaryens will have given up their identities.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf""&gt;r/asoiaf&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;ll post it here.

THINK ABOUT IT

There have been hints since the beginning. How else do we make sense of Littlefinger‚Äôs drifting accent? Or extras caught wearing watches? For the gods‚Äô sakes, there have been walk-on cameos by pop stars and musical numbers!

Moreover, if we look at the general trend, I believe we see that though the budget and overall production value has risen significantly and consistently, incidents like the ones I listed above happened more often, not less often, as the show has gone on. We might explain this away by saying that the scope of the show has gotten so large that smaller things can slip through the cracks more easily but THEY DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES. So this brings me to part two of my theory: the show within the show has jumped the shark, and is about to fall apart.

Again, just think about it. What started as a clever political thriller with the occasional supernatural twist has had, in just the last three episodes: zombies, dragons, and a pirate ship battle. All of that said, I do not know what the next episode will bring. But I know how it will all end.

The final episode is going to read like any other, but will feature such gaffs as Kit Harrington forgetting his lines, D&amp;D storming into the set and bitch-slapping him for it, and Peter Dinklage complaining loudly enough about craft services for the boom mic to pick it up. Eventually, tensions within the cast and crew will reach its peak as GRRM bursts into tears and admits to everyone that this whole thing was a Knights Tale fanfic that he just never stopped writing because he never figured out a way to work a singalong of ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You‚Äù in. The cast will spontaneously start to sign the Queen classic in a half-hearted attempt to cheer GRRM up, which will be so successful that he gleefully burns his manuscript of Winds of Winter before screaming ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM FREE‚Äù and running into the woods.

This is my first official Reddit post too btw so please be kind.  Spoilers are in store if you haven‚Äôt seen up to Season 8 Episode 4.

Alright, so I‚Äôm a huge fan of GoT, and been a little confused like many of us as to what the heck is going on in these last couple seasons with the travel distances, climax points such as the night king and Rhaegal dying so easily, and so forth, hear me out...  

By now many have already heard of the baby dragons that Drogon POSSIBLY gave birth to since dragons are able to change their gender in the books.  That theory suggests that in season 4 when he left Dany, he actually went to give birth.  By now those dragons (if that happened), would be as large as Drogon was in season 4 if hatched in convenient timing.  How they would‚Äôve hatched I‚Äôm not sure, but the main thing that matters is we‚Äôre all waiting for the big twist/payout, and this is where the twist could happen for the good guys. Rhaegal dies, Drogon‚Äôs looking kinda weak and vulnerable, perhaps the army of dragons is coming, or at least 3 of them.

Now the big question, where‚Äôs the twist for the bad guys?

Qyburn.  

Qyburn built the Mountain, an undead zombie like monster which is almost too crazy to be true, just like the White Walkers.  In S7E7, not only does the Mountain make an appearance, but Jon and company bring forth an undead walker from the North to prove a point to Cersei, that they exist...  Once unleashed and put on display, the walker loses a hand at which Qyburn not only is shocked at what he sees, he reviews the severed hand quite thoroughly as if looking to see what he can learn from it.  

The question then remains, what has he learned?  Has he learned anything of use?  Perhaps an easier way to create an undead army of their own?  How long would it take?  Who‚Äôs bodies would be used?  Perhaps the Faith of the Seven?  Or perhaps Cersei is looking for Dany to burn all the civilians alive inside the gates so they can double their army since the civilians can‚Äôt fight currently, although this way would be a little odd as they‚Äôd still have to be equipped for battle after?  My bet would be on the Seven, and whoever else died in the Great Sept explosion and since then.

Either way these two theories are major doable twists for the show that could work on both sides which I‚Äôm almost thinking makes sense for both to be true since it would bring forth a major game change to everything we know up until now, which would also pay off the negative events up until now.  Baby dragons replacing Rhaegal and Viserion, and Cersei‚Äôs army replacing the White Walkers.  Huge twists that make perfect sense = huge payout for the shows fans.

Hope you enjoyed the theory!  Let me know your thoughts and thanks for reading.

Like he said, hes not a knight, yet he survives many battles. He once almost died in KL. I think hes gonna die in 5th episode - that will make Jon go super crazy with all that plot armor, he will kill half of Golden Company.

Lets see at episode preview and ship that Euron is on. They are not ready and steady to start fight. They are just getting ready to it. I think Daenerys will fly high above the clouds and start her attack from there. This time she wont kinda forget the Iron Fleet. She will catch them off guard and probably destroy like half of the fleet. That has to be it. Drogon will be overpowered.

The Hound will kill his brother the Mountain and fulfill Maggy the frog‚Äôs prophecy by killing Cersei:  The Hound is ‚Äúthe Valonquar‚Äù.  Arya will be close by to relieve the Hound of his mortal wounds and his life unlike she did in the past.  

2.  Brienne is Azor Ahai, the Prince that was Promised, and she will use the sword that her love, Jaime Lannister, gave her in order to kill Jaime Lannister while he is attempting to defend his sister Cersei during the Last War.  

Or

3.  Jaime will complete his arc transformation by returning to King‚Äôs Landing in time - not as it turns out, to defend Cersei but - to stop Daenerys from burning King‚Äôs Landing and all its inhabitants to the ground just as he stopped her father, Mad King Aerys, with his Valyrian steel sword, the other half of Ned Stark‚Äôs Ice.  See more detail #6 below. 

4.  Varys informs the Golden Company leaders (descendants of bastard Targaryans) that Jon Snow is the rightful king and a Targaryen and either a)proves to their satisfaction that Jon is worth switching allegiances for because then they can finally come home and stop being sell swords or, b) they were secretly planning to switch sides all along because they do have with them Reaghar and Elia Martell‚Äôs son, Aegon, who has been thought to be dead this entire time but has secretly been brought up in Essos under the protection of The Golden Company.  He would be the third head of the Three Headed Dragon; Dany and Jon are the other two. 

5. Tyrion indirectly gives Varys away to Dany, fails to adequately warn or protect him, and Dany has Varys killed in a fit of rage.  

6.  Jon either witnesses Dany‚Äôs actions against Varys or hears about them sometime after he arrives in King‚Äôs Landing (as the previews have already shown Jon alive at the head of the entire army facing KL‚Äôs army at its wall), and he makes a choice to move against, defy, subdue Dany much like he moved against Stannis at the burning of Mance.  This pushes Dany beyond what is left of her reason and she orders Drogon to kill Jon by fire - but bc Jon is a Targaryen, Drogon refuses or hesitates.  This surprises Dany just long enough for Jaimie Lannister to slip in and kill her with his sword just like he killed her father.  However, This action seals Jamie‚Äôs fate, and he is roasted by Drogon. Drogon is killed later in the Last War by Euron. 

Or:   The same #6 except Dany orders Jon killed on the spot and Grey Worm in blind devotion follows her orders.  This outrageous behavior is what turns Jaimie Lannister‚Äôs initial focus upon returning to KL from seeking out Cersei to either try to save her or kill her to instead killing Dany and saving the entirety of KL from burning by another Mad Targaryen.  Jamie is either roasted by Drogon, or perhaps he is Azor Ahai, the Prince who was Promised.  Drogon still gets it by Euron.  

7. If the Golden Company is harboring R+E‚Äôs son, then HE is the rightful king of Westeros, much to Jon‚Äôs relief should he survive.  This Aegon will become King with a willing and happy marriage to Sansa Stark.  Jon will go back to living either at Winterfell or beyond the wall among the free folk as warden of the North AND HE IS REUNITED WITH GHOST and Tormund, of course.  

8. Tyrion will be Hand to the King and Queen.  

9.  Brienne will be the Captain of the Queen‚Äôs Guard.  

10.  (Possible, but not worthy enough for Sansa), Gendry is the legitimate son of Cersei and Robert Baratheon who was taken away from the castle and Cersei by Jamie in a fit of jealous rage when Jamie realized the infant was not his.  Remember Cersei told Catelyn that Jamie was always by her side in the birthing room for each of her children.  He told Cersei the baby had died but did not have the stomach to kill the child, so he took it to Flea Bottom and farmed it off as a bastard of some lord.  
Therefore, with Dany and possibly Jon dead, and the existence of another Aegon in question, Gendry could take the throne and marry Sansa, which would have Arya‚Äôs blessing bc ‚Äúany girl would be lucky to be your lady‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou will make a wonderful lord‚Äù, once again uniting the north and south of Westeros and fulfilling King Robert‚Äôs prophesy to Ned Stark of ‚Äúuniting our two houses‚Äù.

11.  Arya will kill Ilyan Payne. 

12.  Bronn will be Lord of Highgarden. 

13.  Gilly will raise little Sam at the Tarly family home while Sam returns to the Citadel to finish his training to become a Grand Maester.  He eventually serves as Grand Maester to the King and Queen in KL or of the Citadel where he will write all of this down in the histories of Westeros. 

14. Who the hell knows what happens in Dorne. 

15. Oh yeah, and Yara arrives with a few stealthy ships and stalwart loyal Iron Islanders who really hand it to Euron in fine style.  

16.  Btw, If Cersei is truly pregnant at this time, it is no longer Jamie‚Äôs - it can‚Äôt be; but it can be Euron‚Äôs, so she is very possibly telling the truth.  If Euron starts to suspect her of lying to him about the baby because of what Tyrion said to her at the parley, how apropos that for once she is telling the truth but the person who needs to believe her thinks she is lying.  

17.  I still cannot believe we have seen the end of Ghost and Nymeria, and that is why we did not get a satisfactory parting between Jon and Ghost at Winterfell.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

**Prediction:** How will Game of Thrones End (Two episodes left to go)

After having watched ""The last of the Stark"" episode (season 8 episode 4), and after having thought about that scene everyone was miffed about (John Snow not hugging/touching Ghost before leaving each other), I felt like people missed the bigger point. (fact that John Snow didn't give a proper good bye which according to a friend of mine was because it costs too much to do this scene - hugging a dire wolf is not that easy to film (CGI or otherwise) but once again has less significance)

The significance of what happens to Ghost, going beyond the Wall to the North where the dire wolves belong (""Dire wolves don't belong South of the Wall"" - John Snow) is that it will predict what will happen to John Snow, as all the other Dire Wolves have predicted what happens to their respective owner characters.

  

So my theory is that the dire wolves represent the story arc of each of the respective characters and the patterns so far appear to be extremely consistent- I will save John Snow's prediction to the last obviously, because the episode hasn't taken place and I'd like the readers to validate the reasoning of my theory that the Dire Wolves do indeed represent the story arc by reading each dire wolf arc below - in no particular order: (FYI: I haven't re-watched the show but just based on what I remember I am writing the arcs below- please feel free to add more to the details)

**Sansa's wolf (Lady):** Sansa's wolf (Lady) died through no fault of her own. Arya's wolf (Nymeria) was trying to protect its family (Arya/Sansa) from a monster (Joffrey) and Arya let her escape the marauding Lannisters. Lady was sentenced to death in place of Nymeria. This represents the story arc of Sansa in that Sansa herself an innocent ""Little Bird"" through no fault of her own goes through her ""death."" - Not literal death obviously, but the death of the ""Little Bird"" to be reborn into someone stronger, wiser and prudent. As Sansa says to the Hound, if it wasn't for Ramsey, Little Finger, Joffrey, etc, she would've been ""Little Bird"" forever - meaning she has indeed gone through a cycle of death and re-birth through no fault of her own but due to what her family member did (in Sansa's case - Ned Stark's honor compelling Sansa into a dangerous situation which led to the death of the ""Little Bird"", similar to how Nymeria's honorable sense to save her family led to Lady's death) - I hope the reader gets the point of Sansa's wolf and the Sansa‚Äôs story arc at this time.

**Arya's wolf (Nymeria)** : Arya's wolf once again tried to do the right thing for her family but ended up being punished for it by being exiled. Similarly, Arya throughout her story arc tries to avenge her family member and has the List of Names to Kill as her mantra which she recites every night before falling asleep (this action I think has a significance too that I can‚Äôt think of at this time). Similar to Nymeria, Arya is exiled from her familiar surroundings and goes on exploring places that she never imagined she would, eventually ending up in Bravos to become the disciple of the Faceless God. As we know by the ‚ÄúLong Night‚Äù episode (episode 8 season 3), we have a validation that she has become a Goddess herself, if not a demi-God figure, an entity beyond Human that can slay the God of Death himself. If we glance at the one scene that Arya reunites with Nymeria, we see that Nymeria has herself become a sort of a Goddess figure, a super-wolf figure to the wolves of the South. Similarly, Arya has become a super-human to the human beings around her. I will wrap up with Arya‚Äôs wolf here as that‚Äôs as much as I can recall.

**Robb‚Äôs wolf (Grey Wind)** is an interesting one ‚Äì I will remind the reader that they die almost at the same time at the Red Wedding, and Grey Wind‚Äôs head sits mounted by stake on top of Robb‚Äôs body. I believe this is intentional for the story arc of Robb (not to show how brutal/savage the Red Wedding orchestrators were- which they are ‚Äì but this point is secondary to the story arc of Robb)

Robb is infused with the most amount of animal instincts by far. When we study his choices, he makes his choices as if he was a very intuitive animal. He is great with the battles (like good hunting pack animals such as wolves/dire wolves are in coordinating and outwitting their preys in a hunt). But he lacks the wisdom (distinctly human quality beyond animal) and thus loses the war to Tywin Lannister (despite Tywin never winning a single battle, because he has a level of Wisdom that Robb doesn‚Äôt). He makes his promise to marry the daughter of the Frey out of immediate necessity (which I feel like was such a rushed decision for choosing your life-long partner even when I first watched it), only later to be infatuated and to break his word by succumbing to his animal instinct of pure lust. By the time of his death, he has indeed become an animal of some sort himself and thereby having Grey Wind‚Äôs head mounted on his body.

**Bran‚Äôs wolf (Summer)** ‚Äì Now my memory is not so clear on Bran‚Äôs wolf, but from what I remember the consistency of the story arcs between Summer/Bran is still very clear (I could be a victim of confirmation bias here‚Ä¶ looking at only facts that match with my theory). I believe he dies protecting Bran under the Tree while he completes his training to become the Three Eyed Raven. Similar to Sansa‚Äôs wolf, Lady, Summer‚Äôs death does not symbolize literal death of Bran (although it could because Bran did indeed become someone entirely new to the point that Bran that his family once knew is no more as he is now the Three Eyed Raven, the world‚Äôs repository of memory and continuity). Throughout Bran‚Äôs journey to the Three Eyed Raven north of the wall, Summer comes at critical times to rescue Bran, and Bran also goes into the mind of Summer many times (‚Äúwarging‚Äù) ‚Äì so while Bran was on the way to become Three Eyed Raven, and he was literally bonding with Summer. As such, Summer‚Äôs death represents the end of Bran the gifted boy to the transformation to the Three Eyed Raven.

**Rickon‚Äôs wolf.** Probably the least amount of detail given but we see Rickon‚Äôs wolf‚Äôs head only to identify that the long lost boy is indeed Rickon. I don‚Äôt think I can elaborate beyond this but it does not invalidate my theory as lack of detail/information does not necessarily undermine the consistency of the arcs of each dire wolf above for its respective characters.

**So we arrive at John Snow‚Äôs arc**\- we finally see the separation between John Snow and his dire wolf. Ghost is now going back to where he belongs, beyond the North. This suggests that John Snow will also go to where he belongs by his birthright- the iron throne. However, this is a very sad scene (their good byes really made me wanna cry). This I think indicates John Snow‚Äôs state as he begins on his road to become the King. Sadness- why? Because he will have to separate himself from someone he‚Äôs close to without wanting to do it himself similar to how Ghost had to separate himself from John Snow (someone Ghost is very close to) without wanting to do it himself. I think you know where I am getting at ‚Äì he will have to separate himself from Dany, and take the iron throne himself out of sheer necessity and the Great Wind of circumstances that carries us all. Dany has become an iron-fist ruler which was exactly what Dany wanted Not to become (the Mad King). She always had a sense of not seasoning (*another word for moderating)* Justice with Mercy (in reference to Portia‚Äôs Quality of Mercy from Merchant of Venice ‚Äì Shakespeare) even in the earlier episodes (one example I can think of is when Dany nails the masters alive even though some of them did indeed want to improve the state of affairs ‚Äì or so the audience is told)

John Snow has the perfect mix of Targaryen / Stark (Stark represents temperance) thereby making him the perfect king. But he does indeed love Dany.

Thus, Dany will be cast aside out of this necessity (separation from someone John Snow is close to), which Dany will know deep in her heart is the right thing to do (John‚Äôs ascension to the throne in her place), as John Snow knew that it was the right thing to do for Ghost to go back to where he came from. 

Thus, John Snow will be crowned as the Sad King. It is poetic how it all started with the Mad King and ends with the Sad King. Madness will only lead to Sadness and only wisdom will ensure the well-being of the realm and mankind - I think that‚Äôs the ultimate hidden message of the entire show

And now his (the show G.O.T. itself) watch is ended.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; How will Game of Thrones End (Two episodes left to go)&lt;/p&gt;

So lets not talk about the throne for a sec, and let's talk potential spinoffs to come. Although the wights are finished, we still have many questions left unanswered. Like are we completely extinct of white walkers? And what's up with the babies?!

Well let's make note that the Night King had control of all of his subjects, his guard included. It seems he has a selection of strong and powerful dead, but we cannot necessarily differentiate them from the wights from what we know. 

Well after Craster's 99th son was born, the NK'S soldier takes him to the altar. Couple interesting things about this is the location could be a sort of ritual. This ritual could have been done on all of his guard to make them more superior than wights, but would that mean he raised them from babies as well? The key point though is the baby was living when turned... but how did his guard come about?

If there is a correlation, then my first question was, ""well the NK is dead, wouldn't they die with him?"" 

BUT I've noticed something within the last few episodes.. the Night King must be in some type of range to rise the dead. Otherwise he could have lifted the dead in the crypt quite some time ago and raised hell. So maybe the dead have to be in range as well to be defeated? Babies can't fight or do anything.

If there is no correlation to the babies with his guard, then we may be looking at a way for the NK to recreate himself -- his ""children"". Which leads me to lay out a potential story line...

That 99 number is odd. We need 100. That 100th baby, Little Sam, has some big shoes to fill.

Though he may have been a silent small play in the show, we could be looking at our next potential hero in Westeros. He was supposed to be the 100th sacrifice.

The god of death, according to the faceless men, takes many faces. In regards to the followers of the LoL, in particular Melisandre's arc, the justification that runs with the theme of x happening for a purpose, i.e. a commonly perceived bad thing being truly good for example burning Shireen to make way for Stannis' victory, is, in part, not only that this and all things are as the lord wills it, but this god will also save them from hell(earth) and grant them heaven, on the other side. However, the two people who are brought back from the dead, Jon and Beric, report only darkness and no other side.

Characters such as Arya and Davos, especially Davos, in realizing some of the heinous or morally objectionable practices their followers undertake, discern the Lord of Light, if there is such a thing, as being evil given what he has his followers do if it's true that he's commanding them. Melisandre, as a priestess of the LoL, or a representation of him, seems to have had help in fighting in the Great War against the NK by the LoL with her fire abilities. She walks off solemnly to her death after helping to achieve the mission she's had for a couple hundred years or so. Her religion, the religion of the LoL is dualistic. The NK is viewed as the darkness. Who is he warring with? Who has he been out to kill primarily? The Three eyed raven. 

But is the magical enemy to humanity only the NK? Is the Lord of Light a force of good? Davos doesn't seem to think so. Shireen didn't think so. Arya didn't think so. The Hound doesn't think so. In S8e4, after mentioning how he was going to kill Melisandre, Davos has this to say, ""She did it to herself or her god did it to her. The lord of light, we play his game for him. We fight his war and win and then he fucks off. No signs. No blessings. Who knows what he wants?"" This theme of a ""bad"" thing happening for a reason, and therefore being worth it, or serving its purpose, is not only found commonly with LoL followers but with Bran. He says as much to Jaime in regards to being a cripple and has this line of reasoning much earlier in the show when he is travelling to meet the 3ER.

""What if I belong in the north. What if I fell from that tower for a reason?"" Osha responds, ""Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason?

All men must die and all men must serve.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ja&amp;#39;qen refers to the Red God, R&amp;#39;hllor, the Lord of Light as an aspect of the one god which is death. The god of death, according to the faceless men, takes many faces. In regards to the followers of the LoL, in particular Melisandre&amp;#39;s arc, the justification that runs with the theme of x happening for a purpose, i.e. a commonly perceived bad thing being truly good for example burning Shireen to make way for Stannis&amp;#39; victory, is, in part, not only that this and all things are as the lord wills it, but this god will also save them from hell(earth) and grant them heaven, on the other side. However, the two people who are brought back from the dead, Jon and Beric, report only darkness and no other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters such as Arya and Davos, especially Davos, in realizing some of the heinous or morally objectionable practices their followers undertake, discern the Lord of Light, if there is such a thing, as being evil given what he has his followers do if it&amp;#39;s true that he&amp;#39;s commanding them. Melisandre, as a priestess of the LoL, or a representation of him, seems to have had help in fighting in the Great War against the NK by the LoL with her fire abilities. She walks off solemnly to her death after helping to achieve the mission she&amp;#39;s had for a couple hundred years or so. Her religion, the religion of the LoL is dualistic. The NK is viewed as the darkness. Who is he warring with? Who has he been out to kill primarily? The Three eyed raven. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the magical enemy to humanity only the NK? Is the Lord of Light a force of good? Davos doesn&amp;#39;t seem to think so. Shireen didn&amp;#39;t think so. Arya didn&amp;#39;t think so. The Hound doesn&amp;#39;t think so. In S8e4, after mentioning how he was going to kill Melisandre, Davos has this to say, &amp;quot;She did it to herself or her god did it to her. The lord of light, we play his game for him. We fight his war and win and then he fucks off. No signs. No blessings. Who knows what he wants?&amp;quot; This theme of a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; thing happening for a reason, and therefore being worth it, or serving its purpose, is not only found commonly with LoL followers but with Bran. He says as much to Jaime in regards to being a cripple and has this line of reasoning much earlier in the show when he is travelling to meet the 3ER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What if I belong in the north. What if I fell from that tower for a reason?&amp;quot; Osha responds, &amp;quot;Is that what he&amp;#39;s telling you? That it&amp;#39;s all for a reason? All these bad things happen for a reason &amp;#39;cause the gods got big plans for you?

\- Missandei talking about a future on the beach with GreyWorn.

\- Jorah and Lyanna Mormont talking about the future of the Mormont house.

\- Melissandre knowing she has no future, telling it to Ser Davos.

I did not have time yet to listen to the episodes of season 8 to see if Beric / Theon / Eddison Tollet talked about the future / their future, but these guys all died protecting someone else (someone else's futur ? ). 

On the other hand, many other clues point to the future of other characters, where some want to talk about the future and others refuse:

\- Tyrion and Daenerys have a discussion about what should happen after the battle with Cercei, but Daenerys refuses to talk about it.

\-Bran asking Jamie why does he thinks there will be a future.

\-Bran clearly evoking the fact that he prefers to live in the past.

\- Varys (who will die, according to the prediction of Melisandre), speaks about the future of the realm with Tyrion.

\- Sansa's pep talk with Dany about Stark's house future after the battles. 

&amp;#x200B;

This indicates Tyrion, Jamie, Varys and Sansa might die in future episodes. In an extension, we could think the same of Cersei/Euron's futur: they are always projecting  themselves (the baby, etc.). I think all of this is closely connected to Bran since he can be in the past/future, but still need to think about this point. There is a huge emphasis in dialogues of season's 8 about past/future and I am pretty sure we might look that more closely.

Eg at The Twins when killing the Freys. I suspect as it‚Äôs a cool thing we‚Äôll see her do it again before the end. But how would it play out? the show won‚Äôt have a major character death happen offscreen, they are too important and if we do see anyone alive after an onscreen death we‚Äôll know it must be Arya and it won‚Äôt have that big surprise reveal moment. So I figure if she uses the face disguise again it will be someone‚Äôs face who is known but it‚Äôs not that big a big deal if they die offscreen. So that said everyone is saying that Bronn scene in ep4 was a bit ‚Äòodd‚Äô and how did he even sneak up on Winterfell and the Lannisters brothers completely unseen? And then he came on a little harsh/aggressive hitting Tyrion, shooting at Jaime? Ok are you still with me?

Jerome Flynn talking about how fans love Bronn :  I don't know, they might not love him as much as they do right now,"" Flynn told INSIDER at the New York City Game of Thrones premiere. ""But I hope they still do. He is who he is and what he says, isn't he? And he'll do what he needs to get his castle.""

So, maybe this is Jerome misdirecting? ‚ÄòHe is who he is‚Äô huh? What if Arya recognised Bronn and intercepted him as he arrives in Winterfell, interrogated him, killed him and has taken his face BEFOFE the scene where he threatens the Lannister brothers?
Arya certainly knows who Bronn is, when she was in disguise as a serving girl at The Twins she served Bronn and Jaime at Walter‚Äôs feast and was watching them closely (season 6 finale) - Bronn notices her even and says he thinks she wants Jaime‚Äôs golden finger ‚Äòup her twat‚Äô. She watched Jaime talk with Walder and toast the Lannister-Frey alliance and send their regards etc..
Did she confront the Lannister brothers wearing Bronn‚Äôs face to play the game of faces with Jaime and Tyrion looking for lies? Seeing if Bronn‚Äôs story is true,, that Cercei really did send an assassin to kill both of her brothers? Are the Lannister brothers truly to be trusted and really Cercei‚Äôs enemies and trustworthy allies? She could be concerned about Tyrion‚Äôs loyalty to Jon‚Äôs alliance or even how Jaime might be trying to use Brienne as in that scene ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô hears Jaime and Tyrion discussing Brienne as he walks in.
‚ÄòBronn‚Äô knew of Tyrion‚Äôs previous deal about doubling any reward, so Arya could have got that intel directly from Bronn by asking why he‚Äôs in Winterfell before she killed him? ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô also says Cercei offered him Riverrun as reward .. but we saw Qyburn give Bronn payment in advance in gold and says once it‚Äôs done ‚Äòwho knows what she‚Äôd give you‚Äô no mention of a castle? so maybe Arya didn‚Äôt know the payment so is reaching a bit here? Interestingly Riverrun was part of the conversation she overheard Jaime and Walder Frey speaking about at The Twins.  As the servant she was listening to Jaime and Walder talking about the Red Wedding, their alliance, good riddance to the Tully‚Äôs and the Starks and then toasting ‚ÄòLannister‚Äôs and the Freys send their regards‚Äô. Arya‚Äôs seen it first hand so obviously got lots of reason to be really suspicious of Jaime‚Äôs and his involvement in the Red Wedding. 

So scene transitions in GOT are definitely not random! And what does the ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô scene lead into? Straight to Arya who‚Äôs catching up with the Hound to ride to KL to attend to some unfinished business!  Why now? because she has Bronn‚Äôs (Cercei‚Äôs hired assassin) face in her backpack and she has the start of a plan of how she can use it to get into the Red Keep. I‚Äôve reviewed the scene and she‚Äôs got some big packs on the side of her horse, big enough to hide a crossbow. She might not need the crossbow as a weapon but having it will definitely sell her identify as Bronn to Qyburn/Lannisters. 
Also Arya is a known crack shot with the bow/arrow we know since S1ep1 outshooting her brothers, and it‚Äôs shown again in the recent episode  (Gendry‚Äôs proposal scene) she was in fact ‚Äòcelebrating‚Äô at the feast by practising alone with that weapon in the stables. While everyone else was drunk and partying she was alert and focussed. I wonder if she had already intercepted and killed Bronn as he sneaked in during the revelry?
Shooting Cercei with a crossbow would fit with how Rob‚Äôs pregnant wife was murdered by the Frey‚Äôs at the Red Wedding, which would poetically complete Arya‚Äôs revenge against the Lannisters for that.  I‚Äôve heard cast say there‚Äôs another ‚ÄòRed Wedding‚Äô type incident?
Bronn and Cercei can never share the same scene due to personal conflicts but I think it could be worked around, for example there may be lots happening and even more than one person there trying to kill Cercei. So could be Arya\Bronn is hidden taking the shot so they can cut away to him or they use a body double in the scene for Cercei getting hit? Then when Arya removes the face so that Cercei knows who did it, there‚Äôs no need for Jerome Flynn to actually be there.
Cercei is on Arya‚Äôs kill list for amongst other things insisting Lady was killed and forcing Arya to drive off Nymeria; also she could hold her responsible for Joff beheading Ned; for the Lannister‚Äôs role in the Red Wedding. I‚Äôm not sure if Arya might even kill Jaime too? Imagine Arya (as Bronn) turning up at The Red Keep to kill Cercei only to find Jaime there when she left him in Winterfell with Brienne? Betraying the North! She doesn‚Äôt know about him pushing Bran or I‚Äôm 100% sure she would. As a Jaime isn‚Äôt evil fan I hope he has the chance to let Arya/Bronn know what side he‚Äôs on first.  Ohh I can practically hear Arya offering up the last words to a dying Cercei  ‚ÄòThe Starks...and their Direwolves... send their Regards.‚Äô
Just one further clue?! Jerome says other actors had an exhausting s8 but:
‚ÄòIt wasn't that stressful or strenuous for me,"" Flynn admitted. ""Yeah, that's all I'm saying. I wasn't that stressed or strained.""
Well if Arya killed him offscreen before he meets with the Lannister Brothers in Winterfell, Bronn (as himself lol) only had that one fun scene on his back on the bed with the prostitutes when Qyburn gave him the crossbow? Everything else we see of Bronn is actually ‚ÄòArya‚Äô disguised as Bronn? Haha is he just being a bit clever?
But does Arya succeed? Is Arya is the one to actually kill Cercei? she‚Äôs already killed The Night King, is it too much for this one character to take out both show protagonists? Just adding: The show has left out the Valoquar part of the wood witch prophesy, but if it‚Äôs a gender neutral term, Arya is a  ‚Äòlittle sister‚Äô.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arya can obviously disguise herself using faces, but so far in the show has only done so once or twice (?) Eg at The Twins when killing the Freys. I suspect as it‚Äôs a cool thing we‚Äôll see her do it again before the end. But how would it play out? the show won‚Äôt have a major character death happen offscreen, they are too important and if we do see anyone alive after an onscreen death we‚Äôll know it must be Arya and it won‚Äôt have that big surprise reveal moment. So I figure if she uses the face disguise again it will be someone‚Äôs face who is known but it‚Äôs not that big a big deal if they die offscreen. So that said everyone is saying that Bronn scene in ep4 was a bit ‚Äòodd‚Äô and how did he even sneak up on Winterfell and the Lannisters brothers completely unseen? And then he came on a little harsh/aggressive hitting Tyrion, shooting at Jaime? Ok are you still with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerome Flynn talking about how fans love Bronn :  I don&amp;#39;t know, they might not love him as much as they do right now,&amp;quot; Flynn told INSIDER at the New York City Game of Thrones premiere. &amp;quot;But I hope they still do. He is who he is and what he says, isn&amp;#39;t he? And he&amp;#39;ll do what he needs to get his castle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, maybe this is Jerome misdirecting? ‚ÄòHe is who he is‚Äô huh? What if Arya recognised Bronn and intercepted him as he arrives in Winterfell, interrogated him, killed him and has taken his face BEFOFE the scene where he threatens the Lannister brothers?
Arya certainly knows who Bronn is, when she was in disguise as a serving girl at The Twins she served Bronn and Jaime at Walter‚Äôs feast and was watching them closely (season 6 finale) - Bronn notices her even and says he thinks she wants Jaime‚Äôs golden finger ‚Äòup her twat‚Äô. She watched Jaime talk with Walder and toast the Lannister-Frey alliance and send their regards etc..
Did she confront the Lannister brothers wearing Bronn‚Äôs face to play the game of faces with Jaime and Tyrion looking for lies? Seeing if Bronn‚Äôs story is true,, that Cercei really did send an assassin to kill both of her brothers? Are the Lannister brothers truly to be trusted and really Cercei‚Äôs enemies and trustworthy allies? She could be concerned about Tyrion‚Äôs loyalty to Jon‚Äôs alliance or even how Jaime might be trying to use Brienne as in that scene ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô hears Jaime and Tyrion discussing Brienne as he walks in.
‚ÄòBronn‚Äô knew of Tyrion‚Äôs previous deal about doubling any reward, so Arya could have got that intel directly from Bronn by asking why he‚Äôs in Winterfell before she killed him? ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô also says Cercei offered him Riverrun as reward .. but we saw Qyburn give Bronn payment in advance in gold and says once it‚Äôs done ‚Äòwho knows what she‚Äôd give you‚Äô no mention of a castle? so maybe Arya didn‚Äôt know the payment so is reaching a bit here? Interestingly Riverrun was part of the conversation she overheard Jaime and Walder Frey speaking about at The Twins.  As the servant she was listening to Jaime and Walder talking about the Red Wedding, their alliance, good riddance to the Tully‚Äôs and the Starks and then toasting ‚ÄòLannister‚Äôs and the Freys send their regards‚Äô. Arya‚Äôs seen it first hand so obviously got lots of reason to be really suspicious of Jaime‚Äôs and his involvement in the Red Wedding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So scene transitions in GOT are definitely not random! And what does the ‚ÄòBronn‚Äô scene lead into? Straight to Arya who‚Äôs catching up with the Hound to ride to KL to attend to some unfinished business!  Why now? because she has Bronn‚Äôs (Cercei‚Äôs hired assassin) face in her backpack and she has the start of a plan of how she can use it to get into the Red Keep. I‚Äôve reviewed the scene and she‚Äôs got some big packs on the side of her horse, big enough to hide a crossbow. She might not need the crossbow as a weapon but having it will definitely sell her identify as Bronn to Qyburn/Lannisters. 
Also Arya is a known crack shot with the bow/arrow we know since S1ep1 outshooting her brothers, and it‚Äôs shown again in the recent episode  (Gendry‚Äôs proposal scene) she was in fact ‚Äòcelebrating‚Äô at the feast by practising alone with that weapon in the stables. While everyone else was drunk and partying she was alert and focussed. I wonder if she had already intercepted and killed Bronn as he sneaked in during the revelry?
Shooting Cercei with a crossbow would fit with how Rob‚Äôs pregnant wife was murdered by the Frey‚Äôs at the Red Wedding, which would poetically complete Arya‚Äôs revenge against the Lannisters for that.  I‚Äôve heard cast say there‚Äôs another ‚ÄòRed Wedding‚Äô type incident?
Bronn and Cercei can never share the same scene due to personal conflicts but I think it could be worked around, for example there may be lots happening and even more than one person there trying to kill Cercei. So could be Arya\Bronn is hidden taking the shot so they can cut away to him or they use a body double in the scene for Cercei getting hit? Then when Arya removes the face so that Cercei knows who did it, there‚Äôs no need for Jerome Flynn to actually be there.
Cercei is on Arya‚Äôs kill list for amongst other things insisting Lady was killed and forcing Arya to drive off Nymeria; also she could hold her responsible for Joff beheading Ned; for the Lannister‚Äôs role in the Red Wedding. I‚Äôm not sure if Arya might even kill Jaime too? Imagine Arya (as Bronn) turning up at The Red Keep to kill Cercei only to find Jaime there when she left him in Winterfell with Brienne? Betraying the North! She doesn‚Äôt know about him pushing Bran or I‚Äôm 100% sure she would. As a Jaime isn‚Äôt evil fan I hope he has the chance to let Arya/Bronn know what side he‚Äôs on first.  Ohh I can practically hear Arya offering up the last words to a dying Cercei  ‚ÄòThe Starks...and their Direwolves... send their Regards.‚Äô
Just one further clue?! Jerome says other actors had an exhausting s8 but:
‚ÄòIt wasn&amp;#39;t that stressful or strenuous for me,&amp;quot; Flynn admitted. &amp;quot;Yeah, that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m saying. I wasn&amp;#39;t that stressed or strained.&amp;quot;
Well if Arya killed him offscreen before he meets with the Lannister Brothers in Winterfell, Bronn (as himself lol) only had that one fun scene on his back on the bed with the prostitutes when Qyburn gave him the crossbow? Everything else we see of Bronn is actually ‚ÄòArya‚Äô disguised as Bronn? Haha is he just being a bit clever?
But does Arya succeed? Is Arya is the one to actually kill Cercei? she‚Äôs already killed The Night King, is it too much for this one character to take out both show protagonists? Just adding: The show has left out the Valoquar part of the wood witch prophesy, but if it‚Äôs a gender neutral term, Arya is a  ‚Äòlittle sister‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

* A child who defeats the major villain (so far) and making him to look foolish and stupid. ( I don't have any problem that it's girl who defeat the Night King exactly the opposite.

I will not continue with all the mistakes because the list is long and ""THE NIGHT IS FULL OF ERRORS"" not only in season 8 but also in season 7.

I would only share my thoughts on what will happen next which gives me a certain hope about the point of all that and that finally we will see something a little bit more interesting then just some children's script.

We still HAVE THE CHANCE TO SEE in the NEXT 2 EPISODES:

1. THE 3-EYED RAVEN (in the corps of BRAN) shows his truly identity and character and BECOMING the MOST EVIL VILLAIN IN THE WORLD OF SONG OF ICE&amp;FIRE and GAME OF THRONES and so on. (if you're interested to know something more about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bjw3yk/the\_3eyed\_raven\_is\_the\_greatest\_evil\_of\_the\_show/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/bjw3yk/the_3eyed_raven_is_the_greatest_evil_of_the_show/)
2. JON SNOW alias AEGON TARGARYEN BECOMES AZOR AHAI.
3. BALERION the DREAD REBORN/remade  (the major poster of this season (with the dragon of the iron thone) was actually a clue of it) And Dany will dispose again with a very strong army.
4. An interesting scene with JAQEN H'GHAR and his true identity (Rhaegar, Syrio Forel...who knows)
5. A FLASHBACK of the ROBERT's REBELLION in Bran's visions and maybe the battle between RHAEGAR &amp; ROBERT.
6. THE NIGHT KING was not who we thought he was and we will see MANY NEW WHIGHTS.
7. A GREAT SCENE with GHOST saving Jon.
8. THE WALL REPAIRED.
9. WINTERFELL REPAIRED.
10. SUMMER FINALLY COMING....but with two blue eyes at the end (maybe)

Euron covers his eyes to see better and he seems somewhat shocked at what he sees, which shouldn't be his reaction when encountering dragons anymore as he is clearly not afraid as his fleet have been outfitted with scorpion artillery and effectively killed one dragon already. Daenerys has only Drogon left which would make it an easy target in daylight.

I'm wondering because when Samwell Tarly is at the Citadel he sees a book in the restricted part of the library.

This happens right after the notorious poop compilation they made when Sam is emptying everyones' chamber pots, probably purposely done to make most people miss its importance.

It has some kind of circular schematic covering what appears to be some kind of solar or planetary orbit, or perhaps even perhaps how the light bounces off the moon.

While getting books with the other Maester, he is given a book titled ""All history of The House Lannister"".

And he tells Sam:

*""Might be useful. Sh'viathan was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.""*

This is the same Archmaeter Sh'viathan that Tyrion and Bronn had trouble with pronouncing when preparing for the Battle of Blackwater.

Varys comes to the rescue and appears to have the correct pronounciation, which Bronn seems pleased about, yet going back and seeing his pronounciation shows that he also was wrong.

Varys says: Aaah, *""The Great Sieges of Westeros"". Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Sh'viathan wasn't a better writer.""*

Before this Tyrion is frustrated that Bronn is picking the dirt from his fingernails instead of helping him develop a strategy to defeat Stannis.

*""Stannis will be here any day.""*

*""And one of these(books) explains how to beat him?"".*

*""A History of the Great Sieges of Westeros"" by Archmaester Shevelathen... Shevelatesh...*

*""Shevalteesh... I'd swap all your books for a few good archers"".*

So we now have two books by Archmaester Sh'viathan being referrenced in Game of Thrones, both making note of his great work and his lacking writing skills.

One of them refers to the great sieges of Westeros, one of such sieges is currently going on at King's Landing in the show, and the other book refers to the history of House Lannister, coincidentally with Cersei currently being the Queen.

Though it can be easily be disregarded as a running gag, considering the difficulty of pronouncing invented names in fantasy novels, something even R. R Martin has pointed out himself, if these topics had a chance of being used as references for the show, now is obviously the time.

The reason I link these books, Archmaester Sh'viathan and the Lannisters with the book Sam saw at the restricted part of the Citadel is because I saw the exact solar/lunar schematic in a Game of Thrones lore episode on youtube. These animated lore shots are officially related to the show, it's a shame very few watch them.

In it Tywin describes the histories and myths behind the Lannister family name and Casterly Rock.

The lunar chart is only seen for a couple of seconds as it fades between the Lannister sigil and the next scene.

Now, I'm just spitballing here but what if the prophecy of the Long Night is actually a prophecy about a prolonged solar eclipse, that will turn day to night for a thousand years. That would actually explain why the summers and winters in the Game of Thrones universe last for several years and varies, lasting even longer with each passing season.

If this chart is something that predicts the ""Long Night"", basically an Ice Age because of the different solar/lunar orbits in the Game of Thrones universe, then the Long Night is inevitable.

What this means for warfare is that Euron's fleet might have a hard time shooting down Drogon in the darkness, if there is no daylight to reveal its presence. In that scenario if you can see Drogon's flames, it is probably too late.

I'd also like to point out that what appears to be the correct pronounciation of Sh'viathan's name, said by Varys and especially the Maester training Sam, is that the ""Sh"" sounds almost like a soft ""J"". As a Scandinavian I recognize this as a reference to how Swedes sometimes spell words beginning with the ""J"" sound with the letters ""lj..."". For example the Swedish word for *""light""* is spelled *""ljus""*, while pronounced *""(j)ius""*. Basically exactly how one would say the English word *""use""*.

So if the way of spelling Sh'viathan's name refers to the Swedish language, it may be a hint to the word ""Leviathan"". Which is referred to in the bible and Lovecraftian horror. Large beasts. And ""beasts"" have been referred to in the books and show quite often.

When Ned's family found the giant direwolf in the first episode, he called it *""tough old beast""*. Ramsay Bolton called his hounds *""loyal beasts""*. Jon Snow called Daenery's dragons *""gorgeous beasts""*. Bronn describes Dornish Stallions as *""beasts, that could run a day and night without tiring.""* When Arya reuinites with Nymeria, it is visibly apparent that she has grown into giant beast compared to the army of direwolves around her.

The symbolism of beasts and the moon is something that also runs in the show. Before Jon is introduced to Drogon he is seen standing directly under the moon in the background. During the Battle for Winterfell when Daenerys and Jon flies Drogon and Rhaegar high up above the clouds the moon lights the entire landscape of clouds, a scene which many described as beautiful. And the Whitewalkers were responsible for covering the skies by bringing the weather and fog onto the battlefield with them.

When Euron attacks Yara's fleet the moonlight is blocked out by his ships wearing the C'thulu-like sigil on his sails, somehow bringing the storm with him.

The saying: *""The Night is Dark of Full of Terrors""*, might be a way of saying that there are unthinkable horrors waiting for the long night to return which will bring forth an age of horrible beasts that will rule the planet. Dragons might just be a remnant of the last age of beasts.

Perhaps the Whitewalkers mocked the Children of The Forest with their symbols made out of dead men for making a pact with mankind, as the age of men is over. The Long Night marks the end of their reign regardless of the Whitewalkers' victory or defeat. Whitewalkers were undoubtedly better prepared to survive an ice age for a thousand years. Maybe there was a way to turn Whitewalkers back to humans again, just like the Night King could make human babies into Whitewalkers. The wights are undoubtedly zombies, but they were mindless servants. The Nightwalkers surrounding the Night King have minds of their own, and even individual sigils that represent their Houses, their family names.

The deal made between the Night King and Kraster could be a way to secure the survival of the human race from the inevitable age of beasts.

Tywin Lannister, whom only Arya came close to know better personally, has described the Iron Bank as a temple which has survived for a thousand years despite the Long Night. I believe Tywin had knowledge about the coming long night and wanted to ensure that his house, Lannister would be the temple, his dynasty that will last for a thousand years, through the long night. I think he got it from Maggy The Frog as some kind of investigation into the loss of one of his bannermen's daughters who disappeared had to happen, after Cersei came there with her. No highborn girl disappears without some kind of inquiry. I believe he used Maggy the Frog's prophecies to ensure all his victories, so that his family name would survive for a thousand years. As he died, and Cersei's children died one by one, she became aware that power is not power, that Littlefinger was right about ""Knowledge is power"".

When she inherited the throne she also inherited Tywin's information about the future. This is the only thing, in my view that logically explains her arrogance when faced with the concept of Whitewalkers heading south. She is beyond convinced that everything Maggy the frog told her was true. Now that she's aware of what Maggy shared with her father, she is basically as powerful, if not more powerful than Bran.

If you consider that the Faceless men refers to their female assassins as simply ""a girl"", as Jaqen H'gaar did to Arya, and think about Tyrion's whore lover ""Shae"". The Swedish world for ""girl"" is ""tjej"" and is pronounced exactly like ""Shae"". I am utterly convinced that Tywin used Shae as a spy against Tyrion and eventually Sansa. And her tolerance for pain and contradicting backstory means Tywin hired her as a faceless man to secure the end of his son Tyrion who would one day end up killing him. He knew this because of Maggy the frog. Tyrion would always be the man who would kill Tywin on the chamber pot. The ink was dry. Just like Hodor would always hold the door.

There is even a possibility that Shae survived, as there has been plently of deaths in Game of Thrones, but we never got to stay long enough to hear them all shit themselves. Which is a fact shared by King Robert Baratheon. When Tyrion killed Shae there was a prolonged silence. Tywin always wanted Tyrion to hurt because he knew he would kill him. I'm not trying to justify my theory with the absence of shite noices in important scenes, but it might just be something to consider. Faceless men are not just hired to kill people. Jaqen tried explaining this to Arya when ""he"" drank poison, which turned out to be different faceless man. Sometimes you have a role which you have to play out to the very end.

I think Tywin hired a bunch of faceless men with the gold from Casterly, Littlefinger included, and probably many of the lovers to our favorite characters, in order to secure his own vision. He couldn't change the prophecies, but he could change the surrounding pieces. He knew that the War of the Five King would be his last war. He made sure Jaime could read so that he could one day follow his plan.

Cersei bringing the Golden Company from Essos was not to secure her victory against the North. It is a move to overthrow the Iron Bank and secure that the Lannister family name rules mankind for a thousand years and survive the long night, all according to Tywin's instructions. Because Tywin took note of Aegon's conquest of Westeros, but this time it is he who will have changed the rules.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot we see shows nothing in the sky, but the sun.

&lt;p&gt;So if the way of spelling Sh&amp;#39;viathan&amp;#39;s name refers to the Swedish language, it may be a hint to the word &amp;quot;Leviathan&amp;quot;. Which is referred to in the bible and Lovecraftian horror. Large beasts. And &amp;quot;beasts&amp;quot; have been referred to in the books and show quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ned&amp;#39;s family found the giant direwolf in the first episode, he called it &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;tough old beast&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Ramsay Bolton called his hounds &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;loyal beasts&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Jon Snow called Daenery&amp;#39;s dragons &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;gorgeous beasts&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Bronn describes Dornish Stallions as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;beasts, that could run a day and night without tiring.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; When Arya reuinites with Nymeria, it is visibly apparent that she has grown into giant beast compared to the army of direwolves around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbolism of beasts and the moon is something that also runs in the show. Before Jon is introduced to Drogon he is seen standing directly under the moon in the background. During the Battle for Winterfell when Daenerys and Jon flies Drogon and Rhaegar high up above the clouds the moon lights the entire landscape of clouds, a scene which many described as beautiful. And the Whitewalkers were responsible for covering the skies by bringing the weather and fog onto the battlefield with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Euron attacks Yara&amp;#39;s fleet the moonlight is blocked out by his ships wearing the C&amp;#39;thulu-like sigil on his sails, somehow bringing the storm with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saying: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Night is Dark of Full of Terrors&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, might be a way of saying that there are unthinkable horrors waiting for the long night to return which will bring forth an age of horrible beasts that will rule the planet. Dragons might just be a remnant of the last age of beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the Whitewalkers mocked the Children of The Forest with their symbols made out of dead men for making a pact with mankind, as the age of men is over. The Long Night marks the end of their reign regardless of the Whitewalkers&amp;#39; victory or defeat. Whitewalkers were undoubtedly better prepared to survive an ice age for a thousand years. Maybe there was a way to turn Whitewalkers back to humans again, just like the Night King could make human babies into Whitewalkers. The wights are undoubtedly zombies, but they were mindless servants. The Nightwalkers surrounding the Night King have minds of their own, and even individual sigils that represent their Houses, their family names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal made between the Night King and Kraster could be a way to secure the survival of the human race from the inevitable age of beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tywin Lannister, whom only Arya came close to know better personally, has described the Iron Bank as a temple which has survived for a thousand years despite the Long Night. I believe Tywin had knowledge about the coming long night and wanted to ensure that his house, Lannister would be the temple, his dynasty that will last for a thousand years, through the long night. I think he got it from Maggy The Frog as some kind of investigation into the loss of one of his bannermen&amp;#39;s daughters who disappeared had to happen, after Cersei came there with her. No highborn girl disappears without some kind of inquiry. I believe he used Maggy the Frog&amp;#39;s prophecies to ensure all his victories, so that his family name would survive for a thousand years. As he died, and Cersei&amp;#39;s children died one by one, she became aware that power is not power, that Littlefinger was right about &amp;quot;Knowledge is power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she inherited the throne she also inherited Tywin&amp;#39;s information about the future. This is the only thing, in my view that logically explains her arrogance when faced with the concept of Whitewalkers heading south. She is beyond convinced that everything Maggy the frog told her was true. Now that she&amp;#39;s aware of what Maggy shared with her father, she is basically as powerful, if not more powerful than Bran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consider that the Faceless men refers to their female assassins as simply &amp;quot;a girl&amp;quot;, as Jaqen H&amp;#39;gaar did to Arya, and think about Tyrion&amp;#39;s whore lover &amp;quot;Shae&amp;quot;. The Swedish world for &amp;quot;girl&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;tjej&amp;quot; and is pronounced exactly like &amp;quot;Shae&amp;quot;. I am utterly convinced that Tywin used Shae as a spy against Tyrion and eventually Sansa. And her tolerance for pain and contradicting backstory means Tywin hired her as a faceless man to secure the end of his son Tyrion who would one day end up killing him. He knew this because of Maggy the frog. Tyrion would always be the man who would kill Tywin on the chamber pot. The ink was dry. Just like Hodor would always hold the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is even a possibility that Shae survived, as there has been plently of deaths in Game of Thrones, but we never got to stay long enough to hear them all shit themselves. Which is a fact shared by King Robert Baratheon. When Tyrion killed Shae there was a prolonged silence. Tywin always wanted Tyrion to hurt because he knew he would kill him. I&amp;#39;m not trying to justify my theory with the absence of shite noices in important scenes, but it might just be something to consider. Faceless men are not just hired to kill people. Jaqen tried explaining this to Arya when &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; drank poison, which turned out to be different faceless man. Sometimes you have a role which you have to play out to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Tywin hired a bunch of faceless men with the gold from Casterly, Littlefinger included, and probably many of the lovers to our favorite characters, in order to secure his own vision. He couldn&amp;#39;t change the prophecies, but he could change the surrounding pieces. He knew that the War of the Five King would be his last war. He made sure Jaime could read so that he could one day follow his plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cersei bringing the Golden Company from Essos was not to secure her victory against the North. It is a move to overthrow the Iron Bank and secure that the Lannister family name rules mankind for a thousand years and survive the long night, all according to Tywin&amp;#39;s instructions. Because Tywin took note of Aegon&amp;#39;s conquest of Westeros, but this time it is he who will have changed the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me start with why the stone dragons are plausible. We see Euron stunned in the teaser, now with the seasons current writing it's very possible that he is surprised by Drogon. Even though he was more than ecstatic to take him head on last week and that would contradict his character. I believe that it is in fact a stone dragon(s).

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;BONUS:&lt;/strong&gt; This technically satisfies the Valonqar prophecy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hound dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon is in trouble. He&amp;#39;s trapped trying to save people! Oh no! Ghost bounds in and knocks him out of the way of a falling beam! No! Ghost is pinned! Jon, watching his friend die horribly is reminded that he is half Stark. Tries to leave. His leg is stuck! Arya saves him. Huzzah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;NINJA EDIT!&lt;/strong&gt; Arya&amp;#39;s List is now complete!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open in the Red Keep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bald and crazy Dany is being cray. She screams at everyone tells them to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arya has had enough. She gon kill the bitch. She sneaks back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DANY IS DEAD!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is that standing over the body??? It&amp;#39;s the Jaqen H&amp;#39;ghar!!! A man may have no name but he sure as shit have a hard on for murdering royalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaqen smiles as Arya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arya Stark. I thought you were dead?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A girl has no name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Jon who hears the battle raging in the RK. The door is locked!! Someone open the door!!! Arya is in there!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chop door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaqen H&amp;#39;ghar stands over Dany covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon screams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH bolts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon staggers to Iron Throne, drops down, and leans on his sword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Exact position to call us all back to GoT poster with Ned on Iron Throne)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#CallBack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varys took out a loan with the Iron Bank with High Garden as collateral to secure the services of the FM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good civil servant CAN save the realm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(KEEP YOUR GODDAMNED POLITICS OUT OF MY MEDIEVAL DRAMA ABOUT POLITICS, HBO!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Tyrion taking a shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronn kicks in the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronn explains the deal was for High Garden. He just found out that wasn&amp;#39;t happening. Never liked him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronn shoots Tyrion in the gut with a crossbow bolt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Just like HIS dah.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;((IM NOT GOH-NA BE MAH DAH, HBO! STAHP!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrion dies on shitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronn makes quip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a shitty way to go!&amp;quot;) #YOLO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon still on throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KL in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pan through hole in roof of RK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pan back from hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow with head cocked on ledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow is secret Bran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran see all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow fly over Winterfell; See Sansa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow fly over wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow fly over weird tree when old 3ER live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow keep flying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow stop on tree branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crow look in cave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow zoom on cave til screen whole black!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric blue eyes open in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Cut to Bran unwarging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shudders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sansa walks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; She inquires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midwife steps from between legs to reveal Arya has just given birth to Gendrys son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She killed the FM, stole his face, and then bailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What will you call him?&amp;quot; Asks the midwife.&lt;/p&gt;

There is an old theory post about this out there, so this isn't original thinking on my part, but I am giving you a much quicker version and contextualising it in the context of the Season 8 rancour.

- In a clich√©d fantasy book, the Dragon Queen, daughter of a tyrant, restoring her families dynasty would be the villain. Add in an army of dehumanised eunuchs and an equivalent of a Mongol horde so everyone in Westeros hates you.
- A subversion would be for such a character to be the hero, but c'mon children, we can make it more nuanced than that!
- We learn her story almost entirely from her perspective, and from her reasoning, her actions are either well-meaning, or at least relatable behaviour. 
- GRRM loves talking about unreliable narrators in interviews.
- Her story is largely isolated from Westeros and the P.O.V characters. Barristan has a chapter in ADWD, but he is focused on present problems in her absence, not her past behaviour and Barristan is completely loyal to whomever he deems the monarch.
- There is an alternative narrative where Daenerys is an agent of chaos in Essos where she murders her brother, defies Dothraki tradition, robs Qarth, and causes death and destruction in slave cities that revert to the old ways when she is gone. There is a longer version of that in the theory post I am too lazy to find.
- In the books, per this theory, when Westeros and our heroes turn on Daenerys, there are varies ways GRRM could reveal the bamboozle to us. 
1) Explicit - Either one or more characters give us this third person narrative of the harm she has caused. 2) Implicit - when we see her through our favourite P.O.Vs eyes, we are shocked by her, and as readers we are left to reflect on the clues in the earlier books.
- All this will be confirmed by the final book which will be all things to all men.

#TV Show

- It has been said in every possible permutation of phrasing that the ending of the show is the same as GRRM has planned for the books, but we will never know what 'the same' means until the books are finished. The tension is unbearable. What is the substance of the ending of the story, and what are smaller details that don't matter if they are changed in the adaptation? There is definitely a finish
- Being pedantic, the P.O.V in TV and film is that of the camera. Admittedly you can structure the script so the audience only learns what the character learns when they learn it. This is still not as subjective as narrator in a novel can be.
- This problem may have been a factor in the Stannis arc and rage about the show version.  Book Stannis is seen through the eyes of the adoring Ser Davos, who owes him everything, or may have Stockholm syndrome from the finger amputation.
- Personally, it really seemed to me that they were doing this Mad Queen arc in season 5. There are numerous scenes where she monologues about political science and the need for a ruler to be ruthless. The real kicker was the show version of the marriage pact with Hizdar. She burns some of the nobility, without a trial, in retaliation for Ser Barristans death. Then informs a man who is on his knees prepared for his execution that they will marry. Anyone watching that out of context would have a hard time understanding how she could be the hero of the story. 
- This is a very different version of events in the books, but my thesis is they cannot pull the same  P.O.V. trick in the show. What you are left with is some unsatisfactory compromise between a hero and villain. Either the character is too unlikeable, but their ending is believable - or you make them a hero with occasional darker actions and people say you destroyed the character when they go villainous. We are getting the second scenario.

#Book spoilers and taking the blame.

- When Stannis burns Shireen, the showrunners said in the  'Inside the Episode' that it was GRRMs idea. They were shocked but loved it. I sensed they were apprehensive that this shocker would be seen as show only gimmick. This caused some to complain about spoilers. GRRM got asked about it on his blog and seemed annoyed at the question.
- Similarly Hodor 'Hold the door' came from GRRM. They described this as the second of three what-the-fuck moments he told them.
- This season they have undertaken not to confirm what plot points came from GRRM, so the message must have gotten through to them.
- The third WTF moment is likely Daenerys committing war crimes or Jon being the Queen-slayer. 
- Fans want to make martyrs of them for this. Per their undertaking, Benioff and Weiss cannot give credit or blame to GRRM until this arc plays out in the books and the books are already ten years behind schedule.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an old theory post about this out there, so this isn&amp;#39;t original thinking on my part, but I am giving you a much quicker version and contextualising it in the context of the Season 8 rancour.&lt;/p&gt;

I was with all of you last week, pitch forks raised, ready to riot, could not believe that the shows villain that has been foreshadowed for 8 seasons was so easily defeated with no real sacrifice. But what if there was another villain all along, right in front of us.

Bottom line up front - I believe that Arya is headed to Kings Landing to attempt to kill Dany. I believe that Arya will intentionally fail this assassination, forcing Dany to kill her, in full view of Jon. This will allow Jon to finally see Dany for what she is. Jon kills Dany...and there you have it, the prince that was promised.

So since the beginning of the show, we have known that the Night King had only a single goal, erase mankind. A very blatant goal and easily hated, why would this tyrant want to destroy mankind? The Night King was an unstoppable force always advancing. This is an easy villain to follow and an easy motive to rally against. Cersei slowly transformed into a villain. While her goals slowly morphed, it was easy to eventually see that she was willing to do whatever it took to cement her place on the iron throne. Murder innocents, back stab her ""allies"", and put a hit out on her brothers. Again, an easy motive to rally behind and hate, easy to cast her as a villain. In this episode, Dany proved that she is the same as Cersei and the Night King. She is blinded by her goal and at this point is willing to do whatever it takes to cement her place on the throne. During the celebration, she is seen jealous of Jons praise. Jon is understandably celebrating. After all, the battle for mankind was won. But Dany only sees jealousy for the praise he is receiving. Then Sansa appeals to Dany to let the armies at least heal their wounds before marching, and Dany, blinded by her goal, refuses. At first this may seem tactically logical, but really it shows careless regard for lives and again starts hitting on the theme that Dany wants the throne at any cost. And truly, Dany will try to take the throne at any cost, putting her on the same level as Cersei and cementing Dany as the shows leading villain (even ahead of Cersei). This is a tough pill to swallow, because we supported Danys push for the throne for so long and celebrated with Dany in each one of her victories. How disappointing when we find out we have been rooting for the villain the whole time. Then we see Dany pleading with Jon to not tell anybody about his lineage. Jon refuses, and Dany notices this. The next thing we see is Jon telling his sisters and then Arya riding off saying she has unfinished business and is not coming back.

Jon is in danger. And in typical Jon fashion, he is too blinded by his emotions to recognize this. Sansa and Arya are not blinded by emotions. Sansa goes full littlefinger and tells Tyrion. Meanwhile Arya rides south. Aryas real target is Dany. The Starks values have always centered around protecting family. And even though Jon is not a Stark technically, he is still Arya and Sansas brother. Arya and Sansa know that Jon is in danger. Sansa clearly knew, she told Tyrion. Arya has to know. And who is more of a threat to Jon? Dany is. Arya is riding south to attempt to kill Dany, not Cersei.

If you agree with me up to this point, I think there is only one way forward. Arya has to sacrifice herself at the hands of Dany in full view of Jon or Jon will never see Dany for what she really is. So lets think about what happens if Arya kills Dany. Jon finds out, he still loves Dany and believes in her, he now rejects his Stark heritage. This is a bad outcome for the Stark family and I think Arya understands that. But if Jon sees Arya killed by Dany, the hero of Winterfell murdered by the ""rightful"" queen, that would unite the remaining survivors, rally them behind Jon, and let Jon finally see Dany for what she truly is...the shows ultimate villain, no better than the Night king or Cersei.

And here is where we get the prince that is promised. Jon, having seen Dany for her true nature, has to kill her. Its the only fitting ending. He doesn't care about the throne. But he cares about the people. And Dany sitting on the throne is no better than Cersei sitting there or the Night King having succeeded. So Jon has to kill Dany. And he does so by plunging his sword deep into her heart. Deep into the heart of a lover...

I'll see myself out.

Edit: just realized Arya was asked about her list last episode and specifically remained quiet about it. More fuel for the fire?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, hang with me here, but episode 4 has completely restored my faith in the show. I was with all of you last week, pitch forks raised, ready to riot, could not believe that the shows villain that has been foreshadowed for 8 seasons was so easily defeated with no real sacrifice. But what if there was another villain all along, right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line up front - I believe that Arya is headed to Kings Landing to attempt to kill Dany. I believe that Arya will intentionally fail this assassination, forcing Dany to kill her, in full view of Jon. This will allow Jon to finally see Dany for what she is. Jon kills Dany...and there you have it, the prince that was promised.&lt;/p&gt;

He even took one off without effort, why would he be scared when he didnt even hesitate to fight Drogon after killing Rhaegal.

I also have been reviewing the intros of all seasons and there has been 3 changes among them, the last being in this season, here are the changes: [https://imgur.com/tmB2gsX](https://imgur.com/tmB2gsX) . We can clearly see that there is 1 big dragon that could be Drogon, and 3 small ones, wich could be interpreted as his hatchlings

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly think there are more dragons, dont know if young or big like Drogon, but there has to be more. Back some seasons ago, Drogon used to dissapear for some time, we saw him in the ruins of Valyria, when Jorah is traveling with  Tyrion, could be Drogon or someone else, but why he would go to Valyria when he didnt know that place was there?

&amp;#x200B;

In GRR. Martin worlds, Dragons are no gender-specific, so it could be possible that one of the 3 dragons was able to lay eggs some time ago.

Why get rid of Ghost? BUDGET ISSUES, how could they fit more dragons and Ghost together? get rid of moon moon.

Varys and Tyrion will conspire and kill Daenerys after this.

Arya will kill Qyburn. Wearing his face, she will kill Cersai by stabbing her several times in the stomach (a la the red wedding). 

Jaime may kill Arya upon seeing what she has done. This I see going either way but definitely leaning towards this scenario.

Sansa will take the throne either marrying Gendry (the last Baratheon) or Tyrion. She will appoint Brienne of Tarth wardeness of the North.

This theory is only taking into account what we've seen in the show and how it might align with GRRM's vision in a ""broad strokes"" sort of way. **TLDR at the bottom.**

So let's start off with how the vast majority of the fanbase seems to be feeling: disappointed. And we have good reason to be. Character arcs seemingly thrown out the door, character inconsistency, bad tactics, odd set mistakes, Euron ex machina, lack of proper Ghost goodbye, etc. But the disappointment has been discussed ad nauseum, so I won't focus much on it except for character arcs and character inconsistency. Leaving all the other elements that have been disappointing aside, I believe the disappointment we are feeling about the direction they've taken all/most of the characters is **by design.** All of these characters that we are so emotionally invested in are letting us down. After uniting against death incarnate, they are **REALLY** going back to backstabbing, squabbling, and murdering over who sits in an iron chair? Unfortunately, yes. They are all humans, and while humans can grow and change as individuals, **humanity as a whole is always a letdown.** Humans are tribalistic savages focused only on power and fucking, and they always have been. And we have always seen this in the show: the houses constantly playing politics and warring among one another, the constant plotting and scheming, the levels of horrible perversion seen in the whorehouses, wars started over who is fucking who... Look at the two main things going on at the feast literally immediately after a harrowing battle against death incarnate itself: scheming and fucking. So even though the writing has been uneven in recent seasons, one thing has remained consistent: **at the end of the day, humans kinda suck** - even the characters who made it this far, perhaps ESPECIALLY the characters who have made it this far.

**The Children of the Forest knew this about humanity.** They, along with their sacred Weirwood trees, were getting slaughtered in their war against humans, and they saw the writing on the wall: these savages are going to take over and destroy everything. And so, desperate for a solution to the human problem, they created the Night King/White Walkers and gave them one mission and one mission only: destroy all humans. Now, somehow, this goes dramatically wrong, and the Night King eventually turns on the Children. I suspect we will get more of the specifics of that in the prequel series, but I'm guessing the basic idea is that they thought they were creating a mindless killing machine but instead created a sentient killing machine, effectively a sentient AI. He is intelligent and aware, as evidenced by his strategic ability, flare for the dramatic, subversion of the Children's symbols, and his smug smirk/swagger. He was made into this monster **against his will**, so he becomes hellbent on destroying not just the men, but the women and the Children (of the Forest) too. Sorry, couldn't resist the prequel meme.

So obviously the Children realize they **seriously** fucked up and then make a temporary alliance with men. They drive the White Walkers back north and build the Wall, trapping the Night King and his amigos up there. **But just because the White Walker experiment was a failure doesn't mean that the Children somehow forget what they know about humans.** Left unchecked, the humans will eventually destroy them and all of the Weirwood trees. So the Children come up with a plan B: the Three Eyed Raven. Like with the Night King, they would need a human subject, but, critically, they now know they need a **WILLING** human subject, lest he turn against them like the Night King. So they find someone sympathetic to their cause and basically say: ""Look, we're going to turn you into a super-powerful being with admin access to the Weirwood Net, but in the process you are going to lose most of your humanity. We see now that the killing machine approach is wrong, so we're going to try a different way. You are going to manipulate events from a distance over the course of time until, eventually, YOU rule the humans. **The only way to contain the humans is if they are ruled by someone who is not really human at all.**"" Someone all-seeing, logical, and emotionless will be a fair ruler and curb all of humanity's worst tendencies. And ideally that someone will technically be a member of a respected human family... someone like ""Bran.""

**So, I posit that Bran, really the Three Eyed Raven, will rule at the end of S8E6.** There will be backstabbing and murdering galore among those playing the Game (all the main characters), and eventually the remaining survivors will view the cool-headed and emotionless Bran as the only viable option, the only remaining character who didn't play the Game. Since he doesn't really ""want"" anymore, he will accept this responsibility. It is the culmination of his journey, why Jojen said he was so important. Slowly and over the course of many years, **Westeros will rebuild under the logical guidance of the Three Eyed Raven,** free of lust and politics. And the country will **dream of spring**, a spring free of self-inflicted war and turmoil.

I believe the real reason that the Night King specifically targeted Bran was because he knew that the Three Eyed Raven was the second creation of the Children of the Forest. With the Children seemingly all dead in the show, the Three Eyed Raven was the only thing remaining of the Children, the last trace of the creators who he despised and whose symbols he subverted. After killing the Three Eyed Raven, he would have plowed through the rest of Westeros, taking the Iron Throne. **At the end of it all, there were only ever two potential winners: The Three Eyed Raven or the Night King because neither of them are human; neither of them play the Game of Thrones.**

As for the Lord of Light, I don't think we will really see him involved anymore. I think for the show's purpose, the Lord of Light essentially boils down to the Lord of Life, while the Great Other is the God of Death, essentially physically embodied by the Night King.

**TLDR**: Season 8 is playing out this way to remind us that humanity as a whole sucks, despite any perceived growth of individual character. Any one of the remaining main characters taking the Iron Throne would just mean more of the same for Westeros, except for the Three Eyed Raven, because he isn't really human anymore. The Children of the Forest knew humanity sucked and created the Night King to kill them all, but he turned on them because he wasn't a willing participant in the ritual. The Three Eyed Raven is their second creation designed to stop humanity, this time peacefully, by having him eventually rule Westeros. The culmination of Bran's journey and transformation into the Three Eyed Raven is his becoming the ruler of Westeros and wisely leading the country to prosperity, i.e. ""a dream of spring.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I think I might have figured out where they are taking this whole thing, specifically in regard to thematic and fantastical elements.

The Valonqar will be her own son (or daughter if Valonqar is gender neutral like prince in high Valyrian). 

This theory is based on two parts of Maggie the Witch‚Äôs prophecy. 

The first part is ‚ÄúThe King will have 20 children, and you will have three‚Ä¶Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds.‚Äù This implies that she will only have 3 children with Jamie, but in the HBO series she is pregnant with their fourth child. If the prophecy holds true, their fourth child will die before being born. This is only true if you imply ‚Äúyou will have three‚Äù from the prophecy as ‚Äúyou will birth three children.‚Äù This is supported by the fact that Cersei‚Äôs first child, which she had with Robert Baratheon, was stillborn and not included in the prophecy. 

The second part is ‚ÄúWhen your tears have drowned you, the Valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.‚Äù If her pregnancy will end in a stillbirth, then it would fit with the prophecy if she died as a result of the stillbirth.

I think this would be a very ironic and fitting death for Cersei. She has spent her entire life doing horrible things to ‚Äúprotect her children‚Äù but in the end her child will kill her. Also, she has resented Tyrion her entire life for ‚Äúkilling‚Äù her mother when he was born, but in the end she will die in the same manner as her mother. This leaves her two options: forgive her child because it is innocent of wrongdoing (which means that it logically follows that she should forgive Tyrion as well) or resent her child (just as she resents Tyrion).

I cannot believe the choice of words are mere coincidence at this point.

Now, remember last season when Jaime left Cersei and it looked for a second as if the Mountain might kill him? I think this time it will happen. 

The Mountain kills Jaime, The Hound kills The Mountain, Arya gives the Hound the mercy kill he begged for way back when...then she takes Jaime's face and kills Cersei. (I've never been on this theory but i can see it fitting in now).

OR:

The absolute horror show of the Mountain horrifically killing Tyrion...my worst nightmare realised. I can't see how Tyrion would end up face to face with him which is why i am going for Jaime instead. Either way, i will be dissappinted. Perhaps Jaime can kill Euron first.. we live in hope.

Now, here was the REAL forshadowing. Tormund Giantsbane, telling Jon Snow that he has the True North in him. The fact that Jon has left his Ghost beyond the wall. You know where i'm going with this. Next week, Cersei will decimate her enemies, and Bran will finally stop his robotic behaviour and actually do something. He knows how to create the Night King, and he will do so again.

It would be a great touch to see him raise the Crypts of Winterfell and use his ancestors as his army, but perhaps thats a dream too far! 

Amidst all this, Dany will be revealed as the true Azor Ahai by ending Jons life after the war is won. Then Bran will be killed, because only by destroying him can a Night King never be made again. Alternatively, (my oreferred end...) he will take Bran over the wall like he Promised in episode 1, and perhaps he will try and live as a oeaceful Night King, in the True North.

&amp;#x200B;

I havent seen the preview for next week's episode and dont plan to so excuse me if it already proves this theory wrong, but I believe the battle of KL will take a similar course as the battle at the end of Endgame. Cersei's army will decimate what remains of Dany and Jon's, and just as the end looks near, Jon and Dany will exchange their 'final' looks of love with each other when a horn or something will sound in the background, and we'll see over Dany's left shoulder Yara and her Naval Fleet jumping off their boats as they beach (because no one can see naval fleets from far away in this story). They will have brought all the characters from the past to save the day, the remaining good ironborn, Daario Naharis and the 2nd Sons, The Red Priestess from Mereen with an army of red preists, and, to much fan's enjoyment, Tormund and Ghost with some other wildlings(since time of travel is no longer an issue in this show). The new support will overpower Cersei's army, and as the show has made clear in the past, sellswords arent loyal when defeat is on the horizon, so the Golden Company will begin to disband. At this point Cersei seeing the battle is lost will retreat to hit her self destruct button killing everyone, but will be met by Arya and the Hound. Clegane bowl will ensue, and I'm not sure how the rest will go as Jamie also will have a role in this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But thats just my theory as Thrones has basically become a marvel movie at this point. Thoughts?

P.S. Is Robert Arryn still alive? All that hype about how impenetrable the Eyrie is and we dont get any kind of closure there? Cool beans.

Little Finger Started the Game by killing Jon Arryn. GOT writers have been going back to first few episodes of first season. I believe Little Finger killed Little Bird Sansa and took her place as a faceless person. Fore shadowed in Season 7 when Arya confronts Sansa in her room and wonders what it would be like to be ""Lady of Winterfell"". I think Little Finger killed her shortly after this scene. It will be Little Finger who knows what it is like to be the Lady of Winterfell and now he has eyes for the throne. Of course, Arya will have unfinished business with him and will kill his green eyes once and for all. ""if I catch you in a lie, you lose"".

WHY I THINK SANSA IS DEAD ALREADY:

1)  The real Sansa, after everything she went through would never reveal Jon's secret.  Family is everything.

2)  Dire Wolf theory: Starks and their Dire Wolves are one and same

Nimeria the wolf is still alive but a loner, wild and wanderer just like Arya.

Ghost is alive but Jon says he belongs in the North. Jon will survive and go back North.

Rickon and Rob are dead as well as their wolves.

WHAT ABOUT LADY? Lady is Dead, Sansa is already dead-WE JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET

Other Predictions: Tyrion will be King.

Tyrion is really Targaryian. The dragons didn't eat him when he freed them. He told the story when he was little and wanted a dragon. In GOT, there are 3 eggs, 3 dragons. One for each of the 3 remaining Targaryians.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;LF could never sit on the Throne as himself but he can if he were someone else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Finger Started the Game by killing Jon Arryn. GOT writers have been going back to first few episodes of first season. I believe Little Finger killed Little Bird Sansa and took her place as a faceless person. Fore shadowed in Season 7 when Arya confronts Sansa in her room and wonders what it would be like to be &amp;quot;Lady of Winterfell&amp;quot;. I think Little Finger killed her shortly after this scene. It will be Little Finger who knows what it is like to be the Lady of Winterfell and now he has eyes for the throne. Of course, Arya will have unfinished business with him and will kill his green eyes once and for all. &amp;quot;if I catch you in a lie, you lose&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY I THINK SANSA IS DEAD ALREADY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  The real Sansa, after everything she went through would never reveal Jon&amp;#39;s secret.  Family is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  Dire Wolf theory: Starks and their Dire Wolves are one and same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimeria the wolf is still alive but a loner, wild and wanderer just like Arya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost is alive but Jon says he belongs in the North. Jon will survive and go back North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rickon and Rob are dead as well as their wolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT ABOUT LADY? Lady is Dead, Sansa is already dead-WE JUST DON&amp;#39;T KNOW IT YET&lt;/p&gt;

4. Somewhere among this carnage, we see Arya - and Gendry will probably hold her as she dies after killing Cersei.
5. Gendry and Jon now have the two legitimate claims to the Iron Throne. Jon, being Jon, doesn't want to be the King. This fulfills the second part of the prophecy as there is nobody standing before Gendry's claim to the throne now. Gendry takes the mantle and becomes King, naming Jon as his Hand.

In season 8, episode 4 Bran said that he is living in the past which means that all the events happening now repeat what happened in the past. Specifically, Dany will follow in the footsteps of her father the ""mad king"", she will go crazy trying to become queen, she will find out that Jon told everyone that he is a Targaryn making her distrust him, and she will do whatever it takes to rule. Hence, her rule will be short. Jamie will repeat as Kingslayer/Queenslayer, whether that is killing Cersei or Dany. Dany may also be killed by Jon Snow (a Stark) and Gendry (a Baratheon) which is identical to Robert's rebellion where a Stark and Baratheon overthrew the ""mad king"". Jon Snow already said he doesn't want to be king, exactly like his adopted dad (Ned), leaving Gendry (a Baratheon) to become king, just like his dad (Robert). Gendry was legitimized as a Barathoen by Dany for some reason, namely, giving him a legitimate claim to the throne once Dany is dead, Cersei is dead, and Jon Snow doesn't want the throne. Also, something that is totally overlooked, Gendry has some Targaryn blood. His great-grandmother was a Targaryen (seriously, look it up on the family tree charts on the web). Why is this important, because Gendry satisfies all the prophecies. The three headed dragon = Dany, Jon, and Gendry (all with Targaryen blood). Also, the prince that was promised, was born amidst smoke and salt (e.g., a Targaryen) and pulled a sword from fire, he is a blacksmith after all. Why else has this been such a big point all these years, and why is Gendry still alive if not for this big finale. Also, my last theory, is that Gendry will marry Sansa once he is king, maybe to shove it in Arya's face since she wouldn't marry him, and also to satisfy Cersei's prophecy that someone younger and prettier will replace her. if this happens, I also bet that Sansa becomes the next Cersei, again history repeating itself at every step just like Bran said. All that rape and torture and time with Little Finger has made Sansa just as nuts as Cersei. There is your ending right there, two more weeks to see if I proven right or wrong, or maybe 10 years for the books in case the show decides to go a different path. FIRST to predict the ending!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: So one thing that bothered me was LittleFingers (LF) part in all this, and how they killed him off without any explanation as to his plans. I have an explanation for his role that fits with everything above. First, it made no sense that someone in his high position owned brothels. But it does, if he owned the brothels to keep track of Robert's bastards, which apparently he had many. Those bastards were his ticket to the throne the whole time. Allow me to explain, Gendry's mom was a ""tavern wench"", which means she could have worked in one LF's brothels. After Robert's death, Cersei tried to kill all the bastards, and someone magically helped Gendry escape the slaughter.  Theories are it was Varys, but makes more sense that it was LF trying to keep at least one asset/ticket to the throne safe, the same way he helped Sansa escape King's Landing. So LF saves both Gendry and Sansa to earn their trust, become a father figure, or become a savior of sorts to them - although Gendry didn't know it yet and never will because Sansa killed LF. He also tried to creep on Sansa to potentially get her to love him (more on that later).  Gendry has a legitimate claim to the throne, as explained above, so LF's plan was to let Cersei self-destruct and/or let Dany take over and go crazy, then replace them with Gendry and marry Sansa to king Gendry. Since he saved them both, chances are they would make LF Hand of the King or something like that. Anyway, LF's plan would then be to kill Gendry with some mysterious circumstances, and then marry Sansa, assuming that she eventually fell in love with him or went along with his plan, and BOOM LF is now king! Only thing is that Sansa figured out what LF was planning, and she killed LF knowing his plan. The reason the show hasnt revealed anything about the plan is because Sansa is following the plan but for the fact that LF is dead. Now she can become queen without worrying about him. No one else knows this plan. If the show revealed LF's plan, then everything Sansa is doing now would be obvious.

After learning about Jon‚Äôs parentage, Sansa begins thinking long and hard about how she can play the game of thrones. She has remained steadfast in her conviction that the North will no longer bend the knee to any King or Queen. Having learned how to best pit her enemies against each other from Littlefinger, and now equipped with powerful information about Jon's rightful position on the Iron Throne, she devises her plan.

Sansa tells Tyrion about Jon‚Äôs parentage, knowing full and well that Tyrion will tell Varys, who will contemplate what is best for the realm. Sansa then conspires with Arya about how to save the North. They agree that Arya is to go to King‚Äôs Landing and not only kill Cersei, but Dany as well. This helps explain why we see no parting interaction between two of the most beloved characters in the show; the showrunners can't show us their cards. Arya leaves for the South and Sansa sends a raven to Cersei letting Dany is on her way to Dragonstone. Cersei tells Euron to take the fleet and meet them on the way, allowing him to get a headstart, ultimately kill Rhaegal, and capture Missandei. Sansa informs Jamie that Cersei has attacked their forces, knowing that this will send him South.

After the Battle of King‚Äôs Landing, when both queens are killed, the North will regain all power. Jon may or may not take the Iron Throne, but that doesn't matter to Sansa. She leveraged the information she had to set off a chain of events much like Littlefinger did by convincing Lysa Arryn to kill her husband.

They were the primary causer of the Long Night, giving birth to a force of darkness and, seemingly, forcing a man against his will to be a pawn in their war. 

This was the great sin they commited which casted a dark shadow on the world, as all creatures were now facing a magical threat that had the potential to destroy the world.

A plan gone awry because he wanted to kill his creators. The 3ER is closer to their savior. One who will restore a world that doesn't belong to humans, being the player behind the game of thrones, akin to a god, the Lord of Light who moves the players of his game around and uses them to help in bringing an end to his war.

After watching s8e4, I get the feeling that there seems to be an emphasis over the past couple of seasons on the fact that Jon Snow got stabbed through the heart and lived. As far I know, there are only 2 characters in the show who were specified as to have been stabbed through the HEART and ""come back"" (if you will); the Night King and Jon Snow. I can't help but feel that this fact might serve as some sort of a link between Jon Snow and the Night King; ie, Jon Snow becomes the new Night King? 

A couple of points reading this:


1. We know those brought back from the dead don't need to have blue eyes. Both Benjen Stark (resurrected by the Children of the Forest) and Beric (revived by the Lord of Light) don't have blue eyes.


2. Arya's killing of the Night King doesn't fulfill the Azor Ahai prophecy. Perhaps because the Night King foretold in the prophecies isn't the same night king we've seen in the show up until this point? Perhaps the new ""Night King"" presents a bigger threat to the realm of the living and is the one foretold in prophecies?


3. A counter point might be that the wall was supposed to contain magic that prevented wights from crossing over it. And yet, we see Jon Snow even after being brought back traversing freely back and forth. What if Jon Snow is exempted from this because of his Targaryen blood? Maybe because he has both ""ice"" and ""fire"" in his blood, he isn't limited by magic designed to just control ""ice""? This goes back to point 2, how threatening would the new Night King (ie, Jon Snow) be if instead of just having properties of Ice, but also the properties of Fire? 


4. This ending is supposed to be bittersweet according to GRRM. Maybe the bittersweetness comes from the fact that one of our beloved heroes does complete the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" to become king of all realms, except that instead of a king that represents the living, Jon grows into the king that represents the dead? (maybe alluded to in the season 8 preview where, frost and fire collide over a map of Westeros)


5. Another counter point: The original Night King was created by the Children of the Forest, whereas Jon Snow was stabbed (by the nights watch and not by dragonglass as far as we know) and revived (by Melisandre), with no interference from the Children of the Forest. This is where I would argue that Jon Snow will finalize his transformation into the new Night King upon contact with the Children of the Forest at the God's Eye, (which btw seems to be shown more prominently in opening credits, suggesting there is a role for the Children of the Forest remaining). If the Children of the Forest realize that in Jon Snow is someone who is known to survive a stab through the heart, then they have someone strong enough to go through the process of taking over the mantle of the New Night King: the implication being that surviving a stab through the heart is not just a process, but a prerequisite to being a Night King.


6. Perhaps the most farfetched aspect of this theory: The Children of the Forest played a long con on Bran, during the infamous ""Hodor"" scene, to prevent Bran from identifying the true adversary of man. From Brian's perspective, surviving what he did during the ""Hodor"" scene convinces him that the Night King (the one Arya ends up killing) is the true enemy. We know Bran isn't as polished a Three Eyed Raven as he could be because he alludes to it when he talks with Samwell about Jon's lineage; he can only see something if he knows where to look or what he is looking for. The events during the ""Hodor"" scene had to happen for the Children of the Forest to be able to prevent Bran from being inquisitive and trying to ""see"" about potential other threats than the Night King we've seen. Why would the Children of the Forest do this? Because originally, they deemed man to be their enemy and created the original night king to combat man. We've been told that at some point, the Children of the Forest made a truce with Man to turn on and fight the white walkers, but for all we know that may have been a feigned truce. Man has always been the Children of the Forest's true enemy because Man destroys what they hold sacred. Once they realized that even their greatest weapon, the Night King and the white walkers, could be held in check by powers/magic to hold the ""ice"" back (the same type of magic, let's say, that would eventually be used to build The Wall), they realized they needed to create an even stronger weapon; ie, a new Night King that possessed the traits of both fire and ice. In order to do so, they've been playing a long con all this time by feigning truce (earn the trust of the enemy to blind them from things other than what you want them to see), waiting around for a vessel that met the prerequisite of both fire and ice to become the newer, better Night King (Jon Snow, as in point 3). The time would be worth it because the Children of the Forest could eventually feel could completely eradicate man.


All this may be just fanciful thinking on my part, but I just don't want to accept that the show begins with the white walkers, and doesn't end with something related to it.

In Episode 4, Dany saw all the scorpions in Kings Landing and we learned that Euron has them on his ships. Dragons, her best siege strategy, are now useless (barring the removal of 100s of scorpions - unlikely). From what we know, they don't have any good siege options for taking KL.

Dany gets desperate. An enormous army of undead is an effective siege strategy. Dany experienced this firsthand. She finds out how to make a WW by forcing Sam (or Bran) to tell her. They have the ingredients - dragon glass and a wierwood. Jon has incessantly been trying to prove his devotion to Dany. Jon offers to become the first WW (aka new NK). Dany makes Jon into a WW.

&lt;p&gt;The significant scene is when she grants the bastard son Gendry the surname of his father, Baratheon. By doing so, he now has claim to the throne. I think he will end up on the throne. Just like his father, he loved a Stark that did not love him back. But I think Arya will become his hand, just as Ned was Robs, bringing the series full circle.&lt;/p&gt;

We all have been wondering why the White Walkers have been dealt with relatively quickly. All seams rushed, the next big battle is about to go down. Why are the showrunners (who have been given the outline of how its going to go down) focussing on what seems to be two big battles?

And what is going to happen next episode? I think it has to be something insanely fiery! I mean it is already building up for that, but I think the key is literally in the title.

\[Another popular theory I agree with\] Dany will win the war, but only after Cersei blows up King's Landing and everybody with it (vision is of ashes, not snow) and Jon dying. Dany's throne room vision plays out with her winning but with nobody to rule over: citizens dead, her army dead, Jon dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Bran has to play some other significant role right? I think it's him turning Jon into the Night King. Jon will die fighting for Dany. His body will get transferred back to Winterfell to be buried in the Crypts. Bran will turn Jon into the Night King. For what reason, who knows, could just simply be Bran screwed with some timeline in the past/future and now has to continue moving pieces into alignment.

Yes, I know GOT showed us the Children of the Night Forest turning some blonde guy into the Night King, but was that the only Night King or has there been several Night Kings over the span of time (with Jon being this last one that died)? This is where I'm taking the leap saying Jon Snow was this last iteration of the Night King. 1) This could explain why the Night King never attacks/kills/touches Jon Snow when he could easily do so. 2) This could explain why the Night King is able to ride a dragon (dead, but still a dragon). 3) This could explain why the Night King's ONLY goal was to kill Bran: to stop history of Bran changing him into the Night King. 4) I'm sure there are other explanations I'm not thinking of but this is all I got.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came upon this theory after watching the S8E4 conversation between Jon &amp;amp; Tormund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon: [speaking about Ghost] Will you take him with you?...He&amp;#39;ll be happier up there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tormund: So would you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon: I wish I was going with you....This is farewell then.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tormund: You never know....You&amp;#39;ve got the North in you, &lt;strong&gt;the real North&lt;/strong&gt;. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Another popular theory I agree with] Dany will win the war, but only after Cersei blows up King&amp;#39;s Landing and everybody with it (vision is of ashes, not snow) and Jon dying. Dany&amp;#39;s throne room vision plays out with her winning but with nobody to rule over: citizens dead, her army dead, Jon dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bran has to play some other significant role right? I think it&amp;#39;s him turning Jon into the Night King. Jon will die fighting for Dany. His body will get transferred back to Winterfell to be buried in the Crypts. Bran will turn Jon into the Night King. For what reason, who knows, could just simply be Bran screwed with some timeline in the past/future and now has to continue moving pieces into alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Very few of my theories came to fruition, probably b/c they were so ridiculous and outlandish, but they WERE entirely within the realm of possibility.

So, just HOW is GoT going to top The Battle of Winterfell?  Well, **here  is my theory for the last two episodes of GoT .**.....

H'OK, SO.... Dany is going to go crazy, and we see hints of that at  the end of the last episode.  Pretty sure we also see all of King's  Landing burnt to a crisp in the preview for next week, which implies she  burns down the city and all of its civilians.  Dany is going to go so  crazy, that yep, she's going to kill TYRION.  Here are some reasons why:

1. It'll prove to us viewers just how crazy she's gone
2. Tyrion failed to reason with Cersei and indirectly got Missandei killed
3. In her madness, Dany is going to convince herself that Cersei, AND  any living Lannister, poses a possible threat to her claiming (and  staying on) the Iron Throne
4. Deep down, Tyrion knows Dany is  losing her mind and his last convo with Varys all but confirmed this.   Despite Tyrion not wanting to admit it aloud, he'll try to reason with  Dany, which she may misinterpret as treason (as if he was working with  Cersei all along), and couple that with the fact that
5. Dany has already questioned Tyrion's loyalty to her once this season.  LASTLY -
6. Tyrion has served his purpose to Dany, which was as a STRATEGIST to  get her to the Iron Throne.  Well he's physically gotten her there, and  at this point there's no time for anymore strategizing - it's time for  her to fight and win, or fight and die.  She can find a new Hand after  the battle is over.

**ELSEWHERE IN KING'S LANDING**, Jaime is  going to show up and confront Cersei and Euron.  Jaime will be killed by  Euron and Cersei will allow it to happen.

So now we're left with  a ruthless Queen, and an almost-Queen who has gone mad.  The only way  for this to have a non-ruthless ending is for them both to lose, my  guess is in the Throne Room just to make it poetic.  Sure, it's possible  that Cersei could kill Dany, but for maximum poetic-ness, the only way  for Dany to die would be at the hands of Jon.  But one problem - that's  not Jon's character.  Jon doesn't even want the Iron Throne, and he  surely doesn't want to kill his love for it - not unless something  drastic pushes him over the edge....

Enter Arya Stark.  Arya  finds Jaime, and takes on his face in order to get close to and confront  Cersei.  Cersei's all like ""WTF you were dead two mins ago dude???"" and  while Cersei is distracted by her own confusion, Arya-Jaime kills  Cersei.  AJ doesn't realize Dany has gone mad, and Dany doesn't realize  the real Jaime is dead.  So Dany kills AJ to both (1) get rid of the  final ""Lannister"", but more importantly (2) get revenge for Jaime  killing her father.  AJ falls to the ground and turns back into Arya.   Dany is mortified at what she's just done...

Jon enters the scene just in time to see a distraught Dany, who appears to have just killed Arya.

**This is the only thing that can push Jon over the edge.**

Jon kills Dany.

&lt;li&gt;In her madness, Dany is going to convince herself that Cersei, AND  any living Lannister, poses a possible threat to her claiming (and  staying on) the Iron Throne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep down, Tyrion knows Dany is  losing her mind and his last convo with Varys all but confirmed this.   Despite Tyrion not wanting to admit it aloud, he&amp;#39;ll try to reason with  Dany, which she may misinterpret as treason (as if he was working with  Cersei all along), and couple that with the fact that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dany has already questioned Tyrion&amp;#39;s loyalty to her once this season.  LASTLY -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyrion has served his purpose to Dany, which was as a STRATEGIST to  get her to the Iron Throne.  Well he&amp;#39;s physically gotten her there, and  at this point there&amp;#39;s no time for anymore strategizing - it&amp;#39;s time for  her to fight and win, or fight and die.  She can find a new Hand after  the battle is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELSEWHERE IN KING&amp;#39;S LANDING&lt;/strong&gt;, Jaime is  going to show up and confront Cersei and Euron.  Jaime will be killed by  Euron and Cersei will allow it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we&amp;#39;re left with  a ruthless Queen, and an almost-Queen who has gone mad.  The only way  for this to have a non-ruthless ending is for them both to lose, my  guess is in the Throne Room just to make it poetic.  Sure, it&amp;#39;s possible  that Cersei could kill Dany, but for maximum poetic-ness, the only way  for Dany to die would be at the hands of Jon.  But one problem - that&amp;#39;s  not Jon&amp;#39;s character.  Jon doesn&amp;#39;t even want the Iron Throne, and he  surely doesn&amp;#39;t want to kill his love for it - not unless something  drastic pushes him over the edge....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Arya Stark.  Arya  finds Jaime, and takes on his face in order to get close to and confront  Cersei.  Cersei&amp;#39;s all like &amp;quot;WTF you were dead two mins ago dude???&amp;quot; and  while Cersei is distracted by her own confusion, Arya-Jaime kills  Cersei.  AJ doesn&amp;#39;t realize Dany has gone mad, and Dany doesn&amp;#39;t realize  the real Jaime is dead.  So Dany kills AJ to both (1) get rid of the  final &amp;quot;Lannister&amp;quot;, but more importantly (2) get revenge for Jaime  killing her father.  AJ falls to the ground and turns back into Arya.   Dany is mortified at what she&amp;#39;s just done...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon enters the scene just in time to see a distraught Dany, who appears to have just killed Arya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the only thing that can push Jon over the edge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon kills Dany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

EDIT: In the Season 7 finale, Cersei has the opportunity to kill Tyrion right there in her quarters, with the Mountain standing right behind him. She doesn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

In the latest episode, we see Gendry wanting to find Arya to inform her of his new title and Claim to Storm's end. We then witness an arrow just miss him and hit centre-target just behind him. We all know how gifted Arya is when it comes to Archery, with the first episode showing her marksman skills, all the way up to how she defended the Hound by placing a perfect shot to a wight in S8E4. This congregation of evidence makes us aware that she's a bloody good shot.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Hound and Arya, making what it seems to be, a one-way trip to King's-Landing, we are all under the impression that she's after one of her final names, Cersei. This actually might be the case, and her true intent at this point in time, But, we may see her intent shift once we see how Dany may react in the coming battle. With the obvious downfall of Dany this season, she's at a breaking point. With the sacrifices that she has made strapped to the fact she has lost some of her most loyal friends, we won't see her hold-back when it comes to collateral damage, even if it comes to a possible threat to her claim to the Throne.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, I think we will see Arya make a split decision between vengeance over the family she had already lost, with the opportunity to save the family she has at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

With the whole 'Poetic-justice' vibe going on at the moment, another previous event that occurred that will match this was how Olly placed an Arrow into Jon's first love Ygritte, something that was out of Jons control at the time, but ultimately was due to his decision to be honest and loyal to the Nights Watch. Another similarity to how he wanted to be a Targaryen, but also a Stark - something that doesn't affect how he's perceived by his Family, but completely changes how he's looked upon by the Seven Kingdoms (Vary's quote of making him a more appealing claim to the throne).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

\- Arya to Shoot Dany with a well placed Arrow - most probably when riding Drogon (maybe sacrificing herself to save Jon? - whole 1-way trip thing)

\- This also fulfils Melisandre's vision, regarding the Green eyes / Dany - Kind of cementing Jamie being the one to end Cersei?

\- Another scenario where Jon loses someone he loves to an Arrow.

* At the start of every episode is the title sequence. If you pay close attention, the title sequence looks like a moving [Armillary Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere) (or something similar). These spheres can be used for tracking celestial constellations. As the sphere rotates the constellations move and eventually (after a full rotation), repeats itself. This could symbolize that the game of thrones realm is similar in the way that major events of the past repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

# THEORY BREAKDOWN - What I think will happen in the remaining episodes:

* Cersei is defeated by¬†Daenerys and the others.
   * How this happens is highlighted at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

* Sansa (House Stark) refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys (as she hinted to doing in previous episodes)

&amp;#x200B;

* Daenerys has no choice but to threaten to burn Sansa¬†
   * She will be portrayed as the mad queen
   * **Time loop link to the Mad King Era**

&amp;#x200B;

* Someone will kill Daenerys
   * I am thinking that this may be Arya (she is already a Kingslayer, it may be fitting that she also gets the label as Queenslayer).

&amp;#x200B;

* Gendry, who was legitimized as a true baratheon in the latest episode, will end up setting on the iron throne.
   * There must have been a reason that the directors had him legitimized, onscreen, before the final war.
   * **Time loop link to his father, Robert Baratheon being on the throne at the start of season 1**

&amp;#x200B;

* Arya, who now has been labelled as both the King and Queenslayer, is named hand of the king to Gendry
   * She loves him, however, does not want to be a lady. This could be her way of being with him, yet still being the knight / killer she has always wanted to be.
   * There is also potential for her to be pregnant... time will tell what happens for Arya.
   * **If she does kill Daenerys and becomes hand of the king, this will be a time loop link to the ""Kingslayer/Queenslayer"" becoming the hand of the king**

&amp;#x200B;

* Sam &amp; Gilly continue on the Tarley house
   * Both of Gilly's children survive, one boy and one girl
   * I have read somewhere before that Krastor (little sam's real father), was of House Targaryn. Which is why the Night King would take his sons to be converted into white walkers (as seen in the first season where he touches the babies head and its eyes change colour). This could explains why whitewalkers are resistant to fire.
   * Another connection to the Night King and Targaryen's is highlighted at the bottom.
   * **If this is true, this is a Time loop link to the last of the targaryn house surviving, but being hidden away (like Dany and her brother Viserys were)**

&amp;#x200B;

AND LASTLY:

* **John Snow becomes the Night King**
   * **HOW:**
      * Cersei manages to destroy the armies of¬†Daenerys leaving little hope for everyone else. Bran, in a very cryptic way, says to John that he has seen in a vision how to defeat Cersei. John naturally wanting to be the hero, offers to do whatever it is. Bran explains that John needs to become the Night King, raise the dead and finish off Cersei's armies.
      * There may have been a bit of foreshadowing here. All the people of kings landing are gathering at the red keep. Everyone has been hinting at how they will be slaughtered, perhaps John will use the dead to finish off Cersei?
      * **Time loop link to the Night King being used as a weapon (I believe the children of the forest made a Night King to be a weapon against the first men?)**
      * John may agree to do this, however, only if someone promises to kill him after (this could be because he isworried about being unable to control his intentions)
      * Bran lies to John, and agrees to have him killed after.
      * Bran uses a piece of dragonglass / obsidian (whatever is required) to turn John into the Night King.
      * John (the Night King), uses his magic to defeat Cersei¬†
      * Bran refuses to kill John (who is now the Night King), as he has seen the future and in order to keep the balance / keep the loop continuing, the Night King must survive and the ""Armillary Sphere"" must continue to spin, with events repeating themselves.
      * John (now the Night King), is furious that Bran broke his promise and heads north ...the season ends with him walking north through the snow (where everyone has hinted that he belongs throughout the show).

&amp;#x200B;

* **WHY:**
   * It would explain why we were not given many details about the Night King before Arya killed him
   * This would explain why the Night King was coming for Bran (To break the loop / to get revenge on Bran for lying to him in the past)
   * We learn that the Night King is immune to fire, which is known to be a Targaryen trait
   * There is a belief that only Targaryen's can ride dragons
   * The idea that one of the stories biggest heroes is also the biggest villain is quite bittersweet (something GRRM is known for)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there are plenty of holes in my theory; but I do believe there will be a link to a time loop of some sort (and I do not necessarily think all of the ""time loop links"" I listed will come true).

If you pay close attention, the title sequence looks like a moving &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere""&gt;Armillary Sphere&lt;/a&gt; (or something similar). These spheres can be used for tracking celestial constellations. As the sphere rotates the constellations move and eventually (after a full rotation), repeats itself. This could symbolize that the game of thrones realm is similar in the way that major events of the past repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;THEORY BREAKDOWN - What I think will happen in the remaining episodes:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cersei is defeated by¬†Daenerys and the others.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How this happens is highlighted at the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sansa (House Stark) refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys (as she hinted to doing in previous episodes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daenerys has no choice but to threaten to burn Sansa¬†

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She will be portrayed as the mad queen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time loop link to the Mad King Era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone will kill Daenerys

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am thinking that this may be Arya (she is already a Kingslayer, it may be fitting that she also gets the label as Queenslayer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gendry, who was legitimized as a true baratheon in the latest episode, will end up setting on the iron throne.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There must have been a reason that the directors had him legitimized, onscreen, before the final war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time loop link to his father, Robert Baratheon being on the throne at the start of season 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arya, who now has been labelled as both the King and Queenslayer, is named hand of the king to Gendry

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She loves him, however, does not want to be a lady. This could be her way of being with him, yet still being the knight / killer she has always wanted to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also potential for her to be pregnant... time will tell what happens for Arya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If she does kill Daenerys and becomes hand of the king, this will be a time loop link to the &amp;quot;Kingslayer/Queenslayer&amp;quot; becoming the hand of the king&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sam &amp;amp; Gilly continue on the Tarley house

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both of Gilly&amp;#39;s children survive, one boy and one girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have read somewhere before that Krastor (little sam&amp;#39;s real father), was of House Targaryn. Which is why the Night King would take his sons to be converted into white walkers (as seen in the first season where he touches the babies head and its eyes change colour). This could explains why whitewalkers are resistant to fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another connection to the Night King and Targaryen&amp;#39;s is highlighted at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is true, this is a Time loop link to the last of the targaryn house surviving, but being hidden away (like Dany and her brother Viserys were)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND LASTLY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Snow becomes the Night King&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cersei manages to destroy the armies of¬†Daenerys leaving little hope for everyone else. Bran, in a very cryptic way, says to John that he has seen in a vision how to defeat Cersei. John naturally wanting to be the hero, offers to do whatever it is. Bran explains that John needs to become the Night King, raise the dead and finish off Cersei&amp;#39;s armies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may have been a bit of foreshadowing here. All the people of kings landing are gathering at the red keep. Everyone has been hinting at how they will be slaughtered, perhaps John will use the dead to finish off Cersei?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time loop link to the Night King being used as a weapon (I believe the children of the forest made a Night King to be a weapon against the first men?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John may agree to do this, however, only if someone promises to kill him after (this could be because he isworried about being unable to control his intentions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran lies to John, and agrees to have him killed after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran uses a piece of dragonglass / obsidian (whatever is required) to turn John into the Night King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John (the Night King), uses his magic to defeat Cersei¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bran refuses to kill John (who is now the Night King), as he has seen the future and in order to keep the balance / keep the loop continuing, the Night King must survive and the &amp;quot;Armillary Sphere&amp;quot; must continue to spin, with events repeating themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John (now the Night King), is furious that Bran broke his promise and heads north ...the season ends with him walking north through the snow (where everyone has hinted that he belongs throughout the show).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would explain why we were not given many details about the Night King before Arya killed him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would explain why the Night King was coming for Bran (To break the loop / to get revenge on Bran for lying to him in the past)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We learn that the Night King is immune to fire, which is known to be a Targaryen trait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a belief that only Targaryen&amp;#39;s can ride dragons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea that one of the stories biggest heroes is also the biggest villain is quite bittersweet (something GRRM is known for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure there are plenty of holes in my theory; but I do believe there will be a link to a time loop of some sort (and I do not necessarily think all of the &amp;quot;time loop links&amp;quot; I listed will come true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously the big evil is neither cersei nor is IT dany, Its definatly sansa. People are too blind too see. Think about it

 she always expects the worst outcome and knows who to talk to and manipulate things in her favor (littlefinger),

Just to cause some Chaos, which gives her time to  prepare something.

She is the reason jon will die, maybe protecting dany against sansas forces idk, but eventually arya will find out and shut sansas blue eyes forever. So jons purpose might be to help arya once again defeat the Real evil.

Euron looks **sort of** surprised in the last second of the preview for Episode 5. Fans are pointing out that this could be a few things:

1. Armoured Drogon (Most likely option, badass but Drogon could still die.)
2. Drogon flies east to gather more dragons to support Danaerys... I read somewhere that Drogon used to go missing for periods of time and that some people theorise that Drogon was with other dragons in that time. How cool would it be to have like 10 dragons burning the \*\*\*\* outta kings landing!?
3. Somehow Rhaegal isn't dead or is resurrected (most likely by Bran, this option seems least plausible but I could see them doing this.)

In the episode 5 trailer we see a lot of Dany just staring into the distance, with Tyrion approaching very cautiously. She seems to be looking out towards the sea which makes me wonder if Drogon disappears early on in episode 5, with Danaerys freaking out, only to come back later in the episode with back-up!

Actress Emelia Clarke builds up episode 5 in this interview on the Jimmy Kimmel show (skip to 0:20 and save 20 seconds of your life)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlLvPAmXMrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlLvPAmXMrg) 

It's clear from this interview that Emelia's character has her big moments in this episode when compared to the battle of Winterfell which is made obvious from her excitement about this particular episode of the season. I think that whatever the case is, we see full mad queen 'Burn them all' in this episode, and she finally has some success in Westeros.

&lt;p&gt;I want to know what you guys think of these possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

* A game of chess has unique pieces with specific abilities.
* There are as many pawn pieces as there are unique pieces.
   * For GoT, the unique pieces are people like Lyanna/Arya Stark, Jon/Ned.
   * The Night King's pawns are the reanimated dead.
   * The Living's pawns are the countless, faceless soldiers of the living.
* Though each game of chess uses the same pieces, each game of chess is different.
* However, after every game, the same chess pieces are reset onto the board.
   * In GoT, after every game, the world reaches a new balance, then special people fulfill recurring roles.
   * Each legendary tale, and the current story, seems to be variations of the same archetypes.
   * Sometimes, strategies are repeated, like Lyanna declining Bobby B, or Arya declining Gendry B.
* Every move in a game of chess is important, a part of a strategy that evolves.
* Losing a piece in a game of chess can be devastating.
   * In GoT, each person has a character arc toward a goal that ties in to the same thematic goal.
   * When a person dies, they die in mid-progress of that arc, and it can be devastating.
* In a game of chess, there are two sides, dark pieces and light pieces.
* Each side is essentially equal, but the light pieces always move first.
   * In GoT, the light pieces are moved by the Lord of Light, which always moves first.
      * Also, there may be many kingdoms, but only one ruler for the entire land.
   * The dark pieces are moved by the God of Death?
* In a game of chess, if a pawn makes it to the other end, a piece of one's choosing can be resurrected. 
   * Kind of not a great comparison, but either side can resurrect their own pieces.
* In a game of chess, you can castle to protect the king.
   * Plenty of castles throughout Westeros.
   * The Night King is castled behind the wall.
* In chess, you can see where your opponent's pieces are placed. 
   * Bran can use ravens or the Weirwoods to spy on the Night King.
   * The Night King can detect Bran and possibly also see through the Weirwoods (debatable).
* In chess, you play on a board.
   * Westeros may be one board, light on the south and darkness form the north, depending on how you look at it.
   * Essos seems to be a horizontal version of Westeros in some respects.
   * Not enough is known about Southryos to draw a comparison.
   * Americyos is entirely unknown but speculated.

Unnaccounted for Things:

* Magic
* Dragons
* Giants (Maybe the Mountain and the Hound are the Giants in this game)

Now, toward the final episode there's a lone dragon left in known existence, and the Targaryen name doesn't really mean much to Westeros anymore. Bran ""lives mainly in the past"" because the time of the greenseers is all but gone. All of the WW's are dead. The Wildlings have shown themselves to be just ordinary people, and their near-mythical status is gone. 

Not only the distant past, but the more recent structure of Westeros has seen rapid change, and the continent is barely recognisable politically, from where  it was when the story began.

Another factor supporting this idea is that - as others have pointed out - those who've survived are mostly those who've undergone significant personal transformation.

So, given that this is an enormous theme in this show, I highly doubt that Dany will ever be Queen... she's a living relic of the past, and the present world of GoT is incredibly unkind to those. 

Bran's survival is also doubtful, and I think he spends all his time in the past now because he hasn't got much of a future.....the 3 Eyed Raven's time has well and truly passed and he knows it.

Not Dany, who without her last remaining dragon would be pretty much powerless in Westeros. Maybe Jon -- who has separated himself from his direwolf and sent Ghost north of the wall 'where he belongs' -- a symbol of Jon's willingness to leave the past behind? 

Cersei and Euron are way more progressive than the Starks/Jon/Dany, but as the 'villains' I'm not sure their narrative will go that way.

Sadly, I don‚Äôt have a fleshed out theory but rather some thoughts.
 
-Melisandre tells Varys that both will die in Westeros; surely it could also mean that Varys survives and guides the new king/queen (if there is a ruler at all) and lives his life luckily until he dies as an old man, but I honestly expect him to die rather soon, especially regarding last episode. I‚Äôm also wondering if the mysterious voice he once heard in the flames will play some role or if it‚Äôs just a plot device to raise tension. 

-bran is not as omnipotent as people think; i read an interview (I think it was in NYT) with the actor in which he points out that he himself doesn‚Äôt really know all of his powers and never had a long conversation with the show runners regarding those powers as Bran is not supposed to be a superhero but rather a mysterious figure. Nonetheless he said that bran couldn‚Äôt really grasp the future except glimpses and that bran didn‚Äôt have a complete plan on how to kill the night king.

-the parallels between Cersei and Danaerys; there are some parallels like losing their children/dragons, if I remember correctly, there were also some similarities with their camera shots. Also, that Tyrion is afraid of her is similar to Cersei whose men fight for her out of fear. The last episodes allude to a mad khaleesi, but I‚Äôm still not 100% convinced. It might be because I‚Äôm unsatisfied with her character development because it seems a bit rushed but nonetheless I don‚Äôt think that she will be killed by Jon. People especially criticize how she handled the Tarlys and I‚Äôd agree that she made some mistakes there, namely calling them out and demanding that they should kneel. When they refused, it was already to late to back off as a weak leader is a dead leader. On top of that, Jon swore loyalty to her, calling her his queen. As we all know, Jon is not the guy to become illoyal even if it means his own death. They also showed in the preview that Jon and the others will be at the battle, so most of the action going on will be a joint venture, so Jon will have a word to say as well on how they‚Äôll storm the castle. Doesn‚Äôt mean that she won‚Äôt burn down KL in the end, but at least all of her allies should be aware of that option when they will be debating the tactics of the battle and leading the charge.  
I honestly believe, but that‚Äôs simply a feeling, that she will not end up on the throne as she is the ‚ÄòBreaker of Chains‚Äô and as such the necessary violence to end the injustice but that she is unfit to rule. I see her dying in Jon‚Äôs arms. 
It reminds me of Nietzsche‚Äôs Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Funnily, the lion is fighting a dragon, too. http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_thus_spake_zarathustra/I_01.html

At last, I also have some questions:
1) who created the 3er and why? Do we know that?

2) I‚Äôm not too deep into the lore so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but the Nk always appeared to be a non divine being as he was created by the cotf, so he couldn‚Äôt be the great other as such dualism would require the Nk to be much older?

3) what‚Äôs the season? Is winter still coming or is it over already?

Edit: typos","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, im new to this sub, but I was lurking here the last couple of weeks. 
Sadly, I don‚Äôt have a fleshed out theory but rather some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Melisandre tells Varys that both will die in Westeros; surely it could also mean that Varys survives and guides the new king/queen (if there is a ruler at all) and lives his life luckily until he dies as an old man, but I honestly expect him to die rather soon, especially regarding last episode. I‚Äôm also wondering if the mysterious voice he once heard in the flames will play some role or if it‚Äôs just a plot device to raise tension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-bran is not as omnipotent as people think; i read an interview (I think it was in NYT) with the actor in which he points out that he himself doesn‚Äôt really know all of his powers and never had a long conversation with the show runners regarding those powers as Bran is not supposed to be a superhero but rather a mysterious figure. Nonetheless he said that bran couldn‚Äôt really grasp the future except glimpses and that bran didn‚Äôt have a complete plan on how to kill the night king. Oh, and he says that when he‚Äôs having his final moment with the nk, his glance should express pity as he knew that the nk didn‚Äôt become the nk on his own but was simply a poor guy who was transformed into a killing machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The battle of Kings Landing will wrap up  with Cersei's death, either by Arya (with Qyburn's face?) or by Jaime. It's pretty clear that Jaime is going down to KL because he cares about Cersei; he's not intending to kill her. However, when Cersei sees that defeat is inevitable, she'll want to set off all the wildfire Qyburn has placed throughout the city. Jaime will once again have to kill royalty to save KL. With Cersei killed, the Golden Company will fold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dany will already be wreaking havoc on the city, with many innocents dying. Greyworm will die in the fight, leaving her truly alone (no Jorah, Missandei, or Greyworm). Once Cersei is killed. She will reign things in and expect to be crowned. After all the fear she's instilled and with the truth of Jon's lineage being no secret, Varys will reveal the information on a much grander level, leaving everyone (mostly northerners) wanting Jon to take the crown. Furious, Dany will order Drogon to burn Varys, who dies (fulfilling Melisandre's words) in a willful way. She will also begin to unleash the dragon on the court. 

&amp;#x200B;

Drogon will have to be killed in the commotion (maybe he will hesitate to kill Jon and leave an opening) and Dany will also die, perhaps by Jon or by Tyrion. Though saddened, Jon will take the crown long enough to call the heirs of the great houses together. Davos will be Hand of the King cause he's the best wingman. Sansa, Robin Arryn, Gendry, the new prince of Dorne, (maybe Bronn?), and either Tyrion or Jaime (whoever survives to own Casterly Rock) and Jon will meet to discuss the new order of the 7 kingdoms. Jon will order the throne destroyed in some way and finally break the wheel. Bran will stare. End.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this is that it really doesn't leave any room for any major twists and turns. No Red Wedding 2.0 or anything. It does follow the Dany-losing-it arc to its fruition, which may cause some hate. But if Jon is the song of ice and fire, it fits.

* **Arya's Dagger contains NK magic/power**

The Dagger has a history in Westeros, we know that, and it killed the NK in ways that was VERY similar to his creation (middle of the chest, weirwood trees, dragonglass/valyrian knife)

* **Sansa and Arya plotted some backup plan in case of anything that puts Jon in risk**

So, both of them knows Jon's true lineage, and want him as ruler, because he would let the North alone and some other stuff. The thing here is that Arya and Sansa have this backup plan, it could be like, killing Dany if she gets a little mad and don't accept Jon's as a ruler OR Dany could start burning people with Drogon and Arya decides to end her madness there (or even Jaime could kill her with Arya's dagger, making him 2x Kingslayer). The point is, the Dagger meets Dany's chest

&amp;#x200B;

* **Dany's eyes turn fucking blue**

Her father was well known for his madness, his madness comes with his substantial amount of power that he had over the 7 Kingdoms.Dany will have a greater power, and such power will drive her FOCKING MAD. It's in her gene.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Jon kills the Night Queen (Daenerys)**

This scene could be very interesting, cause there was once in Westeros a Night's Watch Commander that fell in love with a Female White Walker, I did a quick search and you can read [here](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Night%27s_Queen). I didn't think of how this could end, like Jon probably kills NQ/Dany with his sword OR something else that I can't think of. But this could deliver the bittersweet ending we are expecting, a beautiful but tragic scene.

* **Bran's arc gets completed**

We know how powerful Bran is, and his arc is totally tied with the NK and the White Walkers, so there could be like an explanation of what Bran did and how he manipulated everything to finish like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't tried to predict everything, but my main goal was to make a theory that gravitates towards the dagger containing NK powers, and Dany getting stabbed by it, and Jon having to kill Dany.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you remember the prophecy that Cersei receives as a child? It states that she would have 3 children, and that she would see all of them dead (check, and I strongly believe that she'll die before giving birth to any other baby). It also states that a ''younger and more beautiful'' woman would steal her position, and I think that most people believed this is referring to Dany, so let's take a look at her.

&amp;#x200B;

Dany had 3 ''children'' (we're not counting her son with Drogo, because he died/was killed right at the moment of his birth), and by now, two of them are dead (remember she can't have more children). Also, she is losing her sanity. Varys already noticed this, and she is every episode more addicted with the Iron Throne thing, even if the situation doesn't look good to her. Also, she just lost Jorah ans Missandei, and is losing her trust in Tyrion, and like she already tried the diplomatic approach, she seems to be desiring to destroy King's Landing and kill everyone there with Drogon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone will have to stop her, but who? Jon Snow is the man for the job. Not just because he trully cares about all the people at King's Landing, but also he could be manipulated by Varys to do so. I don't believe Jon would kill Dany, and she is also one of ''the five'' that are rumoured to survive till the end of the series ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFhtmml4jiAhXzGbkGHZFiCyEQFjADegQIABAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-characters-who-will-survive-2016-7&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QP3GT7Zkx3qxCVCLJapFY](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFhtmml4jiAhXzGbkGHZFiCyEQFjADegQIABAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-characters-who-will-survive-2016-7&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QP3GT7Zkx3qxCVCLJapFY)). So, if she is not dying, she is probably being arrested at Winterfell.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go back to Cersei. If Dany is imprisoned, who will lead her army against Cersei? No one. It won't be needed, and I'll explain why. We saw Jaime leaving Winterfell to re-encounter with Cersei. But what he said to Brienne when leaving is quite suspicious. He says that Cersei is terrible, and so is he, but these are not words of someone who is going to live a villainous ''Happily Ever After''. Are words of someone who regrets his past choices, and who wants to fix them somehow. But how? Bran said he didn't tell anyone about him because he knew they would need Jaime alive to the war. But Jaime hasn't had a major role in the Battle of Winterfell. Maybe his ''help in the war'' is going to be to kill Cersei. If there's someone who can peacefully pass the walls of King's Landing, this one is Jaime. Cersei will surely let him enter, and he will kill her. Maybe he dies in King's Landing after this, but there's a chance he can escape to meet Brienne again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we have 2 Queens out of the game. One of them already lost 3 children, the other lost 2, and it's very plausible to bet in Drogon being killed in a near future. Also, they both had incestuous relationships (drawing parallels between them).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's look (finally) to real world history, and here is where things get messy. ASOIAF was inspired by the ''War of the Roses''. In this war, we had two families striving for the throne: Lancasters and Yorks. And guess who won it in the end? None of them. Their candidates to the big chair where both killed, and the crown ended up in the head of Henry Tudor.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to Cersei and Daenerys, if both of them can't have the throne, so who is the ''youngest and more beautiful'' queen? You probably guessed, and it's Sansa. Much like in the War of the Roses, two houses where fighting for the throne, but the crown ends up with a third one. Also, let's remember that Sansa was doing good as Lady of Winterfell in the absence of Jon, and the show is showing us how very sharp and smart she also is, like a good politician. Let's remember, also, that by the start of the series she already wanted to be queen, and she was on right path by having an arranged marriage with the king, Joffrey.

&amp;#x200B;

''But what about Jon'', you may say. I don't think he is going to sit in the Iron Throne. Maybe Sansa will give independence to the North, after being crowned as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, and them Jon will be the King of the North. The opposite is possible as well, with Jon, a Targaryen, ruling the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, and Sansa ruling a free North. Jon could also refuse to rule anything at all, going to live north of the Wall with the free folk. It's also possible that he is going to die somehow, because he already accomplished his purpouse to the Lord of the Light (remember Beric died just after he accomplished his)

&amp;#x200B;

But this is not why the ''real history'' part is messy. take a look at the names of the english families and the westerosi ones:

**Lan**ca**ster** \- **Lan**ni**ster**

Yo**rk** \- Sta**rk**

**T**udor - **T**argaryen 

If this is true, than our theory presents a ''York'' rulling after a battle between ''Lancasters'' and ''Tudors'', wich doesn't rhymes good with real history. GRRM could, of course, have done it this way, after all, the battle for the Iron Throne has been Lannister x Targaryen for some time now, but this is the detail that keeps me awake. If the story of Westeros rhymes with the real world history, we will have to see a Targaryen (Daenerys or Jon/Aegon) rulling after a battle between Lannisters and Starks. This is, maybe, a theory by its own, but I'm not sure, maybe GRMM inverted some things so that if someone saw this relation, he couldn't say immediately how the series ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, leave your review. Maybe expand the theory, or say something that you believe that has to be changed.

Now one theory I read earlier is that Cersei had Rheagals body dragged up and re-animated by Qyburn.

I think the dragon might be Dany. It's a ridiculous theory but the more I think about the magic we've seen in Game of Thrones, all the fantasy, other unexplainable things, etc etc... What if when Dany was reborn in fire and the dragon eggs were hatched...she was literally reborn as a human who could turn into a dragon. The witch who ""healed"" Drogo did mention their baby was deformed and reptilian if I remember correctly. Wouldn't it be pretty shocking to Euron if a white dragon swooped in and blasted the hell out of him and the fleet. He only knew of two dragons, one he killed and the one Dany was on.

It could also be the betrayal for Dany's prophecy, to tie that in. She's so hell bent on revenge that she actually betrays herself and the future she's fought so hard to claim. Also she full on loses all love for Jon because he'd probably be mega scared of Dany knowing she's a dragon shapeshifter. Also this could be why Missandei said Dracarys to Dany as her final words. She's not going to be the mad Queen and use Drogon to torch King's Landing, she's going to throw away all hope of being Queen by scaring the shit out of Westeros and becoming a dragon to punish Cersei and her enemies. 

Dany also did mention destiny in the episode and hers being to punish Tyrants. What if when the dust settles she leaves with Drogon to fly the world, settle down and punish future Tyrants as the literal Dragon Queen. Any way there's my out there tinfoil theory about the dragon we hear in the Ep5 preview.

What if when the dust settles she leaves with Drogon to fly the world, settle down and punish future Tyrants as the literal Dragon Queen. Any way there&amp;#39;s my out there tinfoil theory about the dragon we hear in the Ep5 preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Dany is a dragon shapeshifter and has been hiding this since she was reborn in fire with her dragon eggs. She gonna change and roast the fuck out of her enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Something has been bothering me ever since the parley at the Dragonpit.

&amp;#x200B;

When Sandor has his reunion with dear ol' Gregor, he doesn't say, *""Look, you fuck, I'm going to kill you next time we meet, and you know I am - FUCK YOU.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, he says, *""You know who's coming for you.  You've always known.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's the giveaway.  The Hound was never meant to kill The Mountain, and I think I understand why now:

&amp;#x200B;

Back when they were kids, and Gregor pushed his baby brother's head into the fire, they saw something, and probably the same vision for both of them.  If I had to take a guess, it's that they saw a very small female killing a hulking, adult Gregor Clegane.  They both probably thought it was nonsense, especially The Mountain, because how could some little girl kill HIM?

&amp;#x200B;

The Hound surely didn't recognize Arya for what she really was at first, but after he started traveling with her and saw her list and her penchant for violence, he started to put the pieces together that this was the ONE PERSON that could help him get revenge - the person that looks like the most unlikely of badasses, but he already saw the prophecy in the flames so he knows what she's capable of.  Therefore, he had to protect her at all costs.

&amp;#x200B;

That all said, there \*may\* still be a confrontation involving the brothers, but I think it'll be The Hound AND Arya vs. The Mountain.  The Mountain will ignore the smaller threat, and hit Sandor with a fatal blow that gives Arya the opening she needs to take him out.  Then Arya will get an emotional goodbye with her secondary father figure.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;... please read before downvoting?  Please?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBO Executives: (looking at Season 6 Budget, rising actor salaries[i.e. $500k each PER EPISODE for Kit and Emlia alone], anticipated increase in cable and streaming subscribers being marginal, other HBO show commitments....) &amp;quot;Yeah, that&amp;#39;s not happening.  You&amp;#39;re getting a dozen more episodes. Wrap it up.....Oh and by the way, leave us source material for the prequel, which is going to be much cheaper to produce....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sad reality of the primary show&amp;#39;s success and popularity in the first few seasons ultimately being its downfall in terms of keeping a cohesive, logical, and detailed storyline fitting nicely within the overall arc of the show.  They HAD to get the main plot points in, leading the characters and the overall story to its ultimate conclusion, with limited time to do so.  Season 7 and 8 have felt rushed, because they WERE rushed by necessity and the reality of showbusiness, not necessarily any laziness on the part of the writers.&lt;/p&gt;

It went on for a little while and made me think there may be some significance to it if the writers thought it was important to include. So, I rewatched the scene to figure out if it provided any clues.

Bran mentions it was like the one Daemon Targaryen built for his niece. Could this have some significance? I looked him up and this is where it got me thinking.

Let‚Äôs assume the niece he is talking about is Rhaenyra Targaryen. She grew up expecting to be ruling queen but was challenged by her younger half-brother AEGON for the throne (hello Jon Snow, same name?!!) in what was known as ‚ÄúThe Dance of the Dragons‚Äù. This is the story Shireen Baratheon mentions to Davos Seaworth, who, in this same episode, has a conversation with Tyrion about how the Lord of Light helped them win the battle but wonders what the victory means and if the Lord of Light has other plans. 

This could be foreshadowing that what we are witnessing parallels back to the Dance of Dragons, where Rhaenyra‚Äôs (in this case, Daenery‚Äôs) child would be installed as king. Thus being of Ice and Fire (for which the book series gets its name).

- NK doesn't return. Wish he would but he won't. 

- Dany blows a 3 dragon lead. Drogon will die in episode 5. Emilia Clarke said that she was reading the script for the episode and had to put it down and take a walk because it was too emotional. What could be more emotional than losing all 3 of your babies. 

- Euron dies getting crushed by a dying Drogon. Drogon gets impaled by a bunch of ballistae spears because Dany uses terrible tactics yet again and Euron rejoices only to look up and see the falling body of Drogon coming straight at him. That's the preview clip and why it doesn't sound like Drogon. He's falling from the sky dying. If he doesn't die, he makes it back to KL only to be killed by Cersei after questioning his baby daddy status. 

- Qyburn dies setting Kings Landing ablaze with wildfire. Dany will stroll into the throne room which is covered in ash fulfilling her vision. This will be the final straw that breaks her. She will go mad in that throne room. She wins but doesn't ""win"". 

- The hound kills the mountain, dies with him and Arya will ex machina Cersei.
 
- Dany will ""win"" but she is too far gone mentally and Jamie will kill her after Dany has gone on some rant ending with ""Burn them all"" after losing basically everyone and knowing Jon has the real claim to the throne. She will never hold the throne, if she somehow does it's for a hot minute...or hour....or month...Idk who can tell time in this show anymore?

- Jon will go North and find Tormund and Ghost when all is said and done. The conversation with Tormund when he's leaving shows that will most likely happen. 

- Sansa will be the Queen in the North with Brienne as her honor guard. Why?

- Because Tyrion will sit on the iron throne. They will not remarry....or they will divorce...or idk something but they won't be together. Tyrion however, has a deep respect and admiration for Sansa and knows she is a powerful ally in the North and frankly he's a fan favorite and the writers will think its some big twist that he's the one to do it. Also Varys wasn't hinting at Jon in his discussion with Tyrion. Think about it the writers *chose* Arya to kill the NK as  stated ‚ÄúFor‚Ä¶ God, I think it‚Äôs probably three years now, we‚Äôve known that it was going to be Arya who delivers that fatal blow,‚Äù Benioff says in a behind-the-episode clip. ‚ÄúShe seemed like the best candidate, provided we weren‚Äôt thinking about her in the moment,‚Äù Weiss adds. ‚ÄúJon Snow has always been the hero, the one who‚Äôs been the savior, but it just didn‚Äôt seem right to us for this moment,‚Äù Benioff says. They've already chosen who it will be and Tyrion is the best all around draft pick. 

- Vary will be the hand of the king. He respects Tyrion enough to pull strings to get him there and be loyal.

- Jamie will be the new head of the Kings Guard to protect his brother. 

- Who's missing? Oh Sir Davos. Tyrion pardons him and he is lord of the Iron Islands if Yara dies. If she doesn't he'll be lord of Dragonstone....Maybe High Garden if Bronn dies. 

- Bronn somehow dies trying to backstab Cersei. Probably killed by the Mountain. 

- Azor Ahai prophecy will never come to fruition or be a thing. They've never actually stated Azor Ahai in the show only mentioning the ""prince who was promised"". As we've seen with the show it will be an afterthought that never holds any merit. One of the best red herrings to exist.

* Ice = Owned by Stark. Home is Wnterfell. The North is cold. Main use was to behead those who broke the Night's Watch oath. Notable use was to behead Ned Stark. Melted down to create Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail.
* Oathkeeper = killing those in the Night's Watch who left the wall, ""it shall not end until my death..."" effectively making sure they keep their oath.
* Widow's Wail = Widow, to lose a spouse through death. Wail, a cry of pain, grief, or anger. This describes what the sword Ice did to Catelyn Stark.
* Lady Forlorn = Forlorn, pitifully sad and abandoned, lonely. Unlikely to succeed or be fulfilled.  Describing much of the House Corbay, ""an old but poor house."" Basically forgotten by the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.
* Heartsbane = How Randyll Tarly felt about his first born son. Yet, it can also describe Jorah's feelings to Daeny.
* Longclaw = Bears have the longest claws in the animal kingdom, except for a dragon. The claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords. 
* Unknown Dagger (catspaw) = what could this name reveal?

Lost Valyrian Weapons (TV show)

* Blackfyre = reverse of Targaryen sigil.
* Brightroar = Lannister's sword. Lannister a lion for a sigil. Lion's roar. 
* Dark Sister = Dark, evil or sinister.

Lost Valyrian Weapons (Book)

* Blackfyre, the sword of Aegon I Targaryen. Carried by all Targaryen kings until Aegon IV, who gave it to his bastard Daemon, who rose in rebellion against the Targaryens, taking the sword's name for his house. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.
* Brightroar, the ancestral sword of House Lannister, lost when King Tommen II Lannister of the Rock sailed to Valyria and never returned.
* Dark Sister, the sword wielded by Visenya Targaryen. Its last known owner was Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers.
* Lamentation, the ancestral sword of House Royce, lost in the Storming of the Dragonpit.
* Orphan-Maker, the ancestral sword of House Roxton. Its last known owner was Ser Jon Roxton.
* Truth, a Valyrian steel sword last carried by Moredo Rogare of Lys.

While all of this crazy shit is going down Bran's over in Winterfell creepin' hard, like TLC style, just quietly dropping little bombs that seem to mean nothing but in reality when does GOT ever do shit as sloppy as they've done this FINAL season. We love this show because of the twists and turns and amazing writing. They have grown this show into something that will become so much more than just a TV show, it'll become a legend that people will watch over and over for years.  So far we haven't seen that show yet this season, every character seems to have changed who they truly are. Everyone seems to be struggling with inner turmoil, and yes they've been through hell and back, but this isn't the first time these characters have seen ugly, except for this time instead of their struggles making them stronger they seem to be making them weaker. They're all making rash unreasonable decisions and it's getting worse and worse as each episode airs. Everyone seems to be spiraling down and fast. Why would a show who has built these characters up for 10 years take the last few episodes to tear them down to shit, there has to be a reason our most loved and logical characters have become complete idiots!

I think I know that reason, I think it's Bran. I know Bran has a ton of ""tin foil"" theories but let's be honest this show is all ""tin foil"" so nothing is out of the question. Bran is running shit right now, and we're too focused on the fight for the throne and poor ass Missandei getting done dirty to notice Bran's true nature. As far as we know Bran is the ""3 eyed raven"" but I think there is so much more to that ""title"". Bran has made it clear he isn't a Stark anymore, he can't be lord of Winterfell because he's not a man. Bran is simply an entity, like the Night King, he was a man once but just like when the Children of the forest drove that dragon glass into his heart forcing him to become something he did not want to be, the Bloodraven downloaded all of his information into Bran forcing him to become the 3 eyed raven. Before Bloodraven is killed he transfers his entity into Bran (metaphorically driving dragon glass into his chest). Bran then changes, he now has a different purpose and path. But what is that path, was it to eliminate the Night King, maybe... or is there more to it. Does Bran wan't to rule. 

Stick with me here... Melisandre introduces us to the god R'hllor aka The Lord of Light. During a scene that she has with Shireen where she tells her that there are only 2 gods, the Lord of Light who brings light, warmth and life, and then the ""Great Other"" who brings darkness, cold and death. The Night King has always been hypothesized to be the physical embodiment of the Great Other. Now that we know that, along with knowing that the NK's true enemy is Bran/ 3 eyed raven, it's not a far jump to assume that Bran is the Lord of Light. Most who believe this theory assume that the Lord of Light means life he's the ""good"" god the one who want's happiness and peace. But as we've seen from the Priestesses who warship the lord they... don't really do good things \*\*cough cough\*\* burn children alive. So if Bran is the Lord of Light, then what does he want? He want's everyone to burn, the ""Lord of Light"" isn't really a God he is a man a bastard Targaryen named Brynden Rivers who was sent to the wall when he tried to overthrow his brother who was King at the time. Brynden was known for his obsession with magic and spells, he also had a red birthmark on his face in the shape of a raven... hence the name Bloodraven. One day Brynden/Bloodraven goes beyond the wall and is never seen again, until Bran gets to the tree that Bloodraven has grown into. We don't know what has happened with him during that time, but we do know he knows his physical body is coming to an end so he needs to transfer his power into Bran before he dies. He successfully does this and Bran is now the new 3 eyed Raven. Bran is no more now, he has been replaced by the Bloodraven to continue his path towards ruling all. This is clearly a problem for the NK, since Bloodraven/The Lord of Light is his nemesis. If the Lord of Light (which is now Bran) won then that would mean the end of him, and that's exactly what happened. 

We're all left with giant cheers for Arya and the defeat of the NK! Our girl did it ya'll she slayed him with the damn dagger that was meant to kill Bran! Full circle in typical GOT fashion. But oh no now we have to face Cersei... who we are lead to believe is the true evil the true villain the real threat. But I think that the show is trying to glamour us into forgetting that Bran still has this extremely strong power and we don't know much about it. I don't think it's a mistake that every time Bran has meaningful conversations with people the show cuts away. With such little show time left why wouldn't they use that time to give us the information we have all been desperately seeking? I believe it's because they want the bomb they're going to drop to be as big of an explosion to shock everyone including the characters in the show.

That bomb is Bran, while everyone is fighting for the throne, Bran is waiting to make his move and it's going to be a big ass move. He wants to be all powerful, he isn't a God he's just a man who wants what all men want, power. He uses magic through fire to obtain his power, the more burning the more power he holds. He want's everyone to burn. Bran is a wolf in sheep's clothing, waiting for his time to make his move and when he does we're going to be left completely speechless. 

Since S8E1 the show has taken out much loved characters and almost done an 180 from where their arches were previously leading. I don't think this is sloppy writing by D&amp;D I think this is purposeful, to get us to be completely off the wall confused as to what the hell is going on, which yeah we all absolutely are! Everyone, even characters in the show are confused, Dany's trusted advisers are turning on her, Jon's family is starting to question if he's thinking logically or blinded by love. Everything is a mess and I 100% think this is exactly how Bran wants it. In an interview with the New York Times (just yesterday) the actor that plays Bran, Isaac Hempstead, was asked about how some people feel that Bran could be Evil. He said, and I quote, ""Interesting!

However I can't shake this feeling, maybe call it a fool's hope, but I don't believe that the ending is going to be this cut and dry mop up of Cersei with some bittersweet ending due to some last minute major character death. I'm also not saying that Cersei and other major characters won't die, because all signs point to that happening.

What I do believe though, is that this show always subverts expectations, and while sometimes it seems to come out of nowhere such as Arya killing The Night King, I don't actually think it's quite as poorly planned out as it seems.

**The Night King Problem**

Many viewers were disappointed with The Long Night episode and the end of the White Walkers, many accusing D&amp;D as just writing bad TV and going off on their own, I think it's another problem entirely. In the books (at least thus far) there is no character behind The White Walkers, they are simply The Other, the problem started way back when the show introduced this character of The Night King, thus establishing a villain instead of just a threat. White Walkers are basically supposed to be just like zombies in any apocalypse survival story (yes I know they are ""more"" than zombies, but the role is the same), in those stories the zombies are an obstacle but rarely are they the point of the story, they serve as conflict for sure, but it's always character driven stories that make us care about conflict. That's why in The Walking Dead show people cared more about the villainous Governor or Negan were more significant villains than any walker was. Not defending or praising that show by any means, but the fault of The Night King's demise being anticlimactic is due to his very existence in the show as a focal point villain for us to rally against. It worked too well though.

I think D&amp;D had the right idea *at the time* he was created to give this faceless other a leader, it worked *too* well and took the focus away from what the actual story was meant to be about. Not saying The White Walkers were not meant to be a big deal, but if you create a villain like The Night King, you need a Hero, and the convenient power couple for that was Jon and Dany, and of course D&amp;D used that to mask the set-up for Arya. 

I'm not going to say that GRRM's idea was for Arya to stab some White Walker leader and they all burst into ice chunks, it could very well just be more of a desperate battle of the living vs. the dead, and by morning they emerge victorious (though likely with much better battle tactics employed than what the show has).

Not defending this, but I think the reason we are unsatisfied with the whole White Walker plot is because the show made it out to be bigger than the actual conflict and expanded a fan favorite character in Jon (and Sam) into a story that focused on everyone. So if The Night King was never meant to be this major conflict point for the whole series, then it must be the War for the Iron Throne.

**The Cersei &amp; Euron Problem**

Cersei is meant to be this terrible ruler, she's petty, selfish, and a very poor leader, not to mention cruel. She isn't given any redeeming qualities for us to like and is set up in both the books and the show as a villain. The show probably even does a better job of establishing her villainy than the books do, just like it did with The NK.

Adding to her entourage we have Euron, who admittedly is a bit underwhelming in his show appearance, where he just appears as this crazy wild raider who is in over his head bumping uglies with royalty due to being really good at what he does. In the books however, Euron is much *much* worse and is a downright sick and depraved individual who has a much darker and twisted personality than just this crazy screaming madman the show gives us. He is set up to be a great villain and combining his forces with Cersei is a great move to solidify this ""bad guy power duo.""

There's one problem with this though and it's obvious to absolutely every single person who read the books or watches the show: Cersei is going to lose. There's no real stakes here anymore, we know she'll probably take down some important characters with her as she falls but her fall is inevitable, it's just a question of price, and who wields the sword. She isn't set up in any way to be a competent battle strategist and despite having the Iron Fleet and Golden Company at her side, is unlikely to have the cleverness needed to stop the combined cleverness and ruthlessness of Dany's army.

So The Night King was never meant to be a villain, and Cersei has been set up to be a villain that is just going to get steamrolled no matter what. What is the real conflict?

**The Aegon Problem**

So we've seen this building up, a rising conflict between Danaerys and Jon over who is the rightful heir to The Iron Throne and who is best suited to rule. The way the show is going it's setting up Dany to be this power-mad tyrant turning into the very thing she's vowed to defeat, and Jon as this wonder-boy who is the obvious favorite pick for everyone. Except for one problem:

He is Ned Stark. No this didn't take a sudden left turn, I don't mean literally, I mean he is cut from the same cloth as his ""father"" in that he's an honorable man who does the honorable thing, and this is what the show has been teaching us for so long, that despite how much we love these characters and their good intentions, that when you thrust them into the Game of Thrones they will be swept away by it's currents. Jon will not heed counsel of his advisors, he will not employ devious tactics or underhanded trickery to do what must be done. In the end he will always do what he thinks is the honorable path instead of the right path, as evidenced by him telling his sisters about his heritage.

So if Jon is a bad ruler, what about Danaerys? Could she actually be the one to sit on the Iron Throne? Well she would be the best candidate surely but would she be a good ruler? Perhaps. She has a sense of duty to her people and a desire to root out tyrants, but unlike Jon she isn't afraid to use whatever means to achieve her goals, even if they don't appear honorable.

This is all a red herring in my opinion, we're once again meant to put all our attention on Jon and Dany and not see Arya jump out of nowhere to save the day. I'm not saying Arya will save it, just that the real true ending isn't Jon or Dany's to give.

Part of the big reason is because most likely according to the books, this is *not* Jon's story, he is The Nights Watch and his story is in the North, and has nothing to do with the political machinations of power hungry Queens. In the book we are introduced to a character named Young Griff, who is suggested to be the son Rhaegar had with his first wife: Elia Martell that The Mountain killed but who was switched with another infant instead. This would give him a more legitimate claim to The Iron Throne than Danaerys without invalidating R+L=J theory for Jon still being a Targaryen. It's a muddy plot and it may not be going anywhere but the likelihood is that Jon and Young Griff were combined together to simplify the plot but it now has Jon no longer playing Jon in the show, it has him playing the part of Young Griff. I could be wrong on all of this but it won't change the final outcome, or the final question:

**Who Sits on the Iron Throne**

The Iron Throne... The Throne... The instrument by which so many wars are fought, by which so much treachery and deception occurs, the instrument that drives men mad (sorry, it's not Bran's time magic, it's just mad with power), is the true villain in this story. The faceless Other that the prophecies speak of is not The White Walkers, it's not Queen Cersei or Queen Daenerys, or Jon, or Bran, or any person, it is The Throne itself, the very symbol of this feudal society that exemplifies the struggles of everyone.

The Iron Throne is what must be destroyed, and it could very well complete the Azor Ahai prophecy of The Prince That Was Promised as well, though it doesn't have to. In this it could very well be a lot of people who destroy the Iron Throne as it's destruction heralds no new King to rule the lands but rather a new chapter in how it is to be governed, if at all. So we could see anyone, Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, The Hound, heck even Varys be the one who destroys the symbol of the Realm for the good of the Realm.

I could be totally wrong here, but even if that is the case, I would still cling to my argument that none of this is going to end in a predictable way, I am sure some may be able to predict what happens, but it won't be boring or simple, it may seem ""there's no time left"" to have such a late-game changer here, but all theories about Jon vs. The NK were dashed in the matter of 1 minute, and we still have 2+ hours to go.

In the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Without the Throne, there is no Game.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fully understand everyone&amp;#39;s apprehension and criticism over this final season thus far, and I admit I&amp;#39;ve felt the same, that there&amp;#39;s a lot of shortcuts and character development seemingly thrown out the window here. I would be lying if I said I was 100% satisfied with how things are going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I can&amp;#39;t shake this feeling, maybe call it a fool&amp;#39;s hope, but I don&amp;#39;t believe that the ending is going to be this cut and dry mop up of Cersei with some bittersweet ending due to some last minute major character death.

That&amp;#39;s why in The Walking Dead show people cared more about the villainous Governor or Negan were more significant villains than any walker was. Not defending or praising that show by any means, but the fault of The Night King&amp;#39;s demise being anticlimactic is due to his very existence in the show as a focal point villain for us to rally against. It worked too well though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think D&amp;amp;D had the right idea &lt;em&gt;at the time&lt;/em&gt; he was created to give this faceless other a leader, it worked &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; well and took the focus away from what the actual story was meant to be about. Not saying The White Walkers were not meant to be a big deal, but if you create a villain like The Night King, you need a Hero, and the convenient power couple for that was Jon and Dany, and of course D&amp;amp;D used that to mask the set-up for Arya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to say that GRRM&amp;#39;s idea was for Arya to stab some White Walker leader and they all burst into ice chunks, it could very well just be more of a desperate battle of the living vs. the dead, and by morning they emerge victorious (though likely with much better battle tactics employed than what the show has).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not defending this, but I think the reason we are unsatisfied with the whole White Walker plot is because the show made it out to be bigger than the actual conflict and expanded a fan favorite character in Jon (and Sam) into a story that focused on everyone. So if The Night King was never meant to be this major conflict point for the whole series, then it must be the War for the Iron Throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cersei &amp;amp; Euron Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cersei is meant to be this terrible ruler, she&amp;#39;s petty, selfish, and a very poor leader, not to mention cruel. She isn&amp;#39;t given any redeeming qualities for us to like and is set up in both the books and the show as a villain. The show probably even does a better job of establishing her villainy than the books do, just like it did with The NK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to her entourage we have Euron, who admittedly is a bit underwhelming in his show appearance, where he just appears as this crazy wild raider who is in over his head bumping uglies with royalty due to being really good at what he does. In the books however, Euron is much &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse and is a downright sick and depraved individual who has a much darker and twisted personality than just this crazy screaming madman the show gives us. He is set up to be a great villain and combining his forces with Cersei is a great move to solidify this &amp;quot;bad guy power duo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one problem with this though and it&amp;#39;s obvious to absolutely every single person who read the books or watches the show: Cersei is going to lose. There&amp;#39;s no real stakes here anymore, we know she&amp;#39;ll probably take down some important characters with her as she falls but her fall is inevitable, it&amp;#39;s just a question of price, and who wields the sword. She isn&amp;#39;t set up in any way to be a competent battle strategist and despite having the Iron Fleet and Golden Company at her side, is unlikely to have the cleverness needed to stop the combined cleverness and ruthlessness of Dany&amp;#39;s army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So The Night King was never meant to be a villain, and Cersei has been set up to be a villain that is just going to get steamrolled no matter what. What is the real conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Aegon Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve seen this building up, a rising conflict between Danaerys and Jon over who is the rightful heir to The Iron Throne and who is best suited to rule. The way the show is going it&amp;#39;s setting up Dany to be this power-mad tyrant turning into the very thing she&amp;#39;s vowed to defeat, and Jon as this wonder-boy who is the obvious favorite pick for everyone. Except for one problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is Ned Stark. No this didn&amp;#39;t take a sudden left turn, I don&amp;#39;t mean literally, I mean he is cut from the same cloth as his &amp;quot;father&amp;quot; in that he&amp;#39;s an honorable man who does the honorable thing, and this is what the show has been teaching us for so long, that despite how much we love these characters and their good intentions, that when you thrust them into the Game of Thrones they will be swept away by it&amp;#39;s currents. Jon will not heed counsel of his advisors, he will not employ devious tactics or underhanded trickery to do what must be done. In the end he will always do what he thinks is the honorable path instead of the right path, as evidenced by him telling his sisters about his heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if Jon is a bad ruler, what about Danaerys? Could she actually be the one to sit on the Iron Throne? Well she would be the best candidate surely but would she be a good ruler? Perhaps. She has a sense of duty to her people and a desire to root out tyrants, but unlike Jon she isn&amp;#39;t afraid to use whatever means to achieve her goals, even if they don&amp;#39;t appear honorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all a red herring in my opinion, we&amp;#39;re once again meant to put all our attention on Jon and Dany and not see Arya jump out of nowhere to save the day. I&amp;#39;m not saying Arya will save it, just that the real true ending isn&amp;#39;t Jon or Dany&amp;#39;s to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the big reason is because most likely according to the books, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Jon&amp;#39;s story, he is The Nights Watch and his story is in the North, and has nothing to do with the political machinations of power hungry Queens. In the book we are introduced to a character named Young Griff, who is suggested to be the son Rhaegar had with his first wife: Elia Martell that The Mountain killed but who was switched with another infant instead. This would give him a more legitimate claim to The Iron Throne than Danaerys without invalidating R+L=J theory for Jon still being a Targaryen. It&amp;#39;s a muddy plot and it may not be going anywhere but the likelihood is that Jon and Young Griff were combined together to simplify the plot but it now has Jon no longer playing Jon in the show, it has him playing the part of Young Griff. I could be wrong on all of this but it won&amp;#39;t change the final outcome, or the final question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Sits on the Iron Throne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iron Throne... The Throne... The instrument by which so many wars are fought, by which so much treachery and deception occurs, the instrument that drives men mad (sorry, it&amp;#39;s not Bran&amp;#39;s time magic, it&amp;#39;s just mad with power), is the true villain in this story. The faceless Other that the prophecies speak of is not The White Walkers, it&amp;#39;s not Queen Cersei or Queen Daenerys, or Jon, or Bran, or any person, it is The Throne itself, the very symbol of this feudal society that exemplifies the struggles of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iron Throne is what must be destroyed, and it could very well complete the Azor Ahai prophecy of The Prince That Was Promised as well, though it doesn&amp;#39;t have to. In this it could very well be a lot of people who destroy the Iron Throne as it&amp;#39;s destruction heralds no new King to rule the lands but rather a new chapter in how it is to be governed, if at all. So we could see anyone, Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, The Hound, heck even Varys be the one who destroys the symbol of the Realm for the good of the Realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be totally wrong here, but even if that is the case, I would still cling to my argument that none of this is going to end in a predictable way, I am sure some may be able to predict what happens, but it won&amp;#39;t be boring or simple, it may seem &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no time left&amp;quot; to have such a late-game changer here, but all theories about Jon vs. The NK were dashed in the matter of 1 minute, and we still have 2+ hours to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Without the Throne, there is no Game.&lt;/p&gt;

All of the character's the dragons are named for died but only one still has a bloodline. Viserys died first (no kids), then Drogo (no surviving Targaryen kids), and since Jon is Rhaegar's only living heir, Rhaegal should still be in play if my theory is correct. Rhaegar's known as the last dragon. Why would his dragon die so easily after fighting his dead brother?

 He's got to be alive somewhere taking the mini vacation that Dany should have let everyone take.  Also, I'm pretty sure Dany is not going to be queen. The whole conversation about needing a c0ck to rule between Tyrion and Varys is foreshadowing to Dany not being queen.

&amp;#x200B;

The Dragons represent the Targaryens:

**Viserion/Viserys**

Viserion being gold colored and Viserys being crowned with gold and is the first Targaryen to die, his parallel character the dragon, was gold colored as seen in this [picture](https://imgur.com/fI7Gjhw). There's also an obvious connection in the nomenclature: Viserys/Viserion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drogon/Daenerys**

Drogon is the most fierce and the leader of the three. Drogon being Daenerys' mount and being named after her first husband. It is quite clear that Drogon is supposed to represent Daenerys.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rhaegal/Aegon**

Rhaegal is green. The color used to describe unripe, or unripe in knowledge, or (of a person) inexperienced or naive. extended meaning is ""open to exploitation"" from the Oxford English Dictionary. Which is what the characters in the show hint at when John Snow/Aegon Targaryen wont use lies or deception to better his odds of success. As seen in the meeting of the Dragon Pit. John admits his allegiance to Daenerys before Cersei. Rhaegal is also named after John Snow's father, so there's reinforcement of a connection there. He mounts Rhaegal. The dragon Rhaegal represents Aegon Targaryen, the second Targaryen to die therefore Rhaegal is the second dragon to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's where the long shot comes in. John Snow is resurrected and avenges himself by executing those who killed him. I propose a parallel plot for his dragon.

I wonder if somehow since the dragon Viserion was resurrected [the same way that Craster's sons were turned (NK turns boy into wight)](https://youtu.be/es9Q81MwPkQ?t=122) (alive) and [by touch (NK turns Viserion)](https://youtu.be/kZToPWcgFo8?t=47) (supposed dead). That the dragon will be the one turning the war in Daenery's favor.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that the way the Dragon was turned, by touch, instead of being raised by the Night King by moving his hands up in the air. means that the Dragons being magical, have supernatural ability to regenerate as other reptiles can regrow limbs. Because the Dragon still had a bit of life left. They can die of course, as mentioned that dragons were killed in wars generations before what we see in Game of Thrones. But they should be harder to kill since they were used to conquer many kingdoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my prediction for the next episode is Rhaegal being shot down in the water. Will recover from the wounds like John did and swoop in and destroy Kings Landing and fulfilling the prophecy that Dany has where the Iron Throne is [laid to ashes](https://youtu.be/gulVUWrADCM?t=20).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also aware that Daenerys has a chance to become the new mad king and fulfill the prophecy that way. But I think the John comes back to avenge/Rhaegal comes back to life to avenge is the more unexpected twist that we have been getting hinted at. After all, dragons can't be tamed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how, but I think it&amp;#39;s going to go down like this.&lt;/p&gt;

I think Jon and Dany may BOTH be Fire Wights, and their baby will be an actual Dragon/Cursed Baby/Lightbringer.

Obviously Jon is now a Fire Wight, but here is why I think Dany may be as well.

-She's immune to Fire. George has been QUITE adamant that Targs are NOT immune to Fire, but Dany clearly is. Do you know who else is probably immune to fire? Fire Wights. This is why she is considered so special. It's also a requirement if you are accepting the ""seed"" of another known Fire Wight.

-She has potential memory loss. She remembers a ""Lemon Tree"" in Bravos. A place where Grass can't even grow. Is this actually a ""Dragon Dream"" of things to come? Possible. Or is this just a result of her Memory Loss. A KNOWN side effect of being a Fire Wight (Thanks Beric for laying the blue print)

Other info that plays out nicely then...

-She miscarried twice (suggested in the books). The first time with Drogo we get a reference that the baby was part ""bat""/dragon. With scales and bat wings, but ultimately deformed. In her dream she dreams of giving birth to a Dragon, and Viserys even makes a comment that her baby with Drogo won't be a TRUE Dragon. Perhaps this is because she is a FireWight/undead and requires another FireWight to produce a child with. She is also called the ""Mother of Dragons"" which I imagine may end up being a literal term.

-If this is the 3rd attempt at a child/Forging a Sword, then it adds up nicely with the Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa prophecy. Her Dragon/baby will then be the ""Lightbringer"". Maybe this happened a previous time in the events that became The Doom of Valyria. 

-It also explains why the White Walkers/Night King became mobilized/returned around the same time Dany was ""born"". Perhaps Bran (while stuck in the mind of the Night King) is aware that the evil Fire Wight/Dragon must be stopped.
