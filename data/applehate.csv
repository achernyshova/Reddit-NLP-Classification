I don't use apple products. My phone is an android, my computer is running windows, and I uninstalled itunes long ago after I realized it installed bloatware. When people would tell me how much they liked apple, I was indifferent. If it worked for them, fine.

&amp;#x200B;

And then this situation: My mom is an iphone user. Way back in 2014 she bought an iphone 6 for her then boyfriend to use and the dude ended up being an abusive asshole and after a climax that revealed just how abusive he was, he went to jail. After years of not being able to even look at his stuff after the trauma, she decided to try to reclaim her property and upgrade her old iphone 5 to the iphone 6 she had purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

Shitty thing about apple #1: My sister, also not an apple user, factory reset the iphone 6 to get it ready for my mom to use. Icloud decided that because the phone hadn't been logged out, it should now be locked to the abuser's apple ID. I don't see how bricking an iphone on factory reset improves security. It means your phone ends up in a dump instead of being resold if it's stolen? Cool I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Shitty thing about apple #2: After explaining the situation to t-mobile and then getting referred to apple, as apparently icloud is off-limits to carriers, the apple rep asked if there was a way I could contact the abuser to get their password. Seriously. Not just this rep but 2 more reps I spoke to later more or less suggested I go track down this guy who beat my mother and say, ""Hey, do me a solid and sign into this iphone"". What. The. Fuck. Another rep suggested trying to reset his password without him knowing, which I told them would also involve hacking into his email at the least. Not that I'd be morally against doing such, but seriously, even apple reps know their system is so fucked up that you have a better shot at spoofing their system than you do at getting them to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

Shitty thing about apple #3: Trying to get a receipt from 2014 ain't easy, and despite apple claiming they'd accept other documentation that showed ownership of the phone, I can say firmly after 3 months of effort getting everything I could from t-mobile that apple gives no shits whatsoever. T-mobile was able to give me an exchange receipt, that clearly shows my mother's name and address, and that she paid 5 dollars for a warranty swap for the current IMEI. Apple rep I spoke to said that should be fine. Illusive apple tech who you can't actually talk to but only submit documents to, and hope they read your notes, denied it. Tried again with the exchange receipt and a payment plan receipt showing the device was purchased 12-20-14 and paid in full with the correct IMEI on it. Wrote a big long note explaining that if they actually looked at the information, there was far more there than a store receipt would tell them about who owned the phone. Get a stock email today saying ""your documents submitted are missing required information"" blah blah blah. Fuck t-mobile a little for having a system that fucks you trying to get a proof of purchase from 2014, but mostly fuck apple.

&amp;#x200B;

Shitty thing about apple #4: At some point I forgot the password for the apple ID I had been using to work on this for my mom. No prob, I'll just reset it and I'll get an email like every other fucking company. Nope! Apple asks for my birthday. I enter my birthday. Apple says my birthday is incorrect. I assume that if apple ever asked for my birthday I gave them a fake one because fuck apple thinking they should know my birthday in order to use their shitty support services. So I start guessing fake birthdays. Nope, locks me out. I ask an apple rep and she suggests I make a new apple ID if nothing was connected to the account. Again, even the reps know their system is fucked up and that you're better off abandoning accounts than trying to retrieve them.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Apple can go fuck itself. Their reps are powerless, the system is fucked, you can't actually explain a situation to anyone that matters. Why people are loyal to apple when this experience has to be pretty typical I can't fucking understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever anyone from now on says they like apple, I'm going to say that's because they don't know how apple likes to fuck you. The only reason they get away with this bullshit is because of an ignorantly loyal customer base.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to not care.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for contacting Apple Support. My name is Audrey. How can I help you?

Hello

tejas aeoe

Is your expertise in icloud?

Audrey

Hi Tejas, yes I am trained in iCloud! Whats going on today?

tejas aeoe

I've recently purchased a brand new desktop and laptop from apple and I would like to register them to icloud and for some reason i can't sign into icloud on both these devices.

tejas aeoe

I can send you the 2 serial numbers

audrey

tejas aeoe

please help me audrey

Audrey

Hi Tejas I’m just reading the information you sent me! Please allow me a moment to type

tejas aeoe

don't read my homework assignment

tejas aeoe

that's private information

tejas aeoe

though if you could give me some homework tutoring that would be nice

Audrey

I wish! Math was never my forte I’m afraid. But I wont read it, and glad to help with iCloud. What happens when you try to sign in?

tejas aeoe

That's programming class

tejas aeoe

btw

Audrey

Thats awesome!

tejas aeoe

I take an extra programming class so that I can get a job at apple one day &lt;3

Audrey

We’d be happy to have you!

tejas aeoe

Aside from that, have you added my devices to icloud?

Audrey

I’m not able to remotely add your devices to your cloud - that would be a breach of privacy for you but I’m happy to help you get signed in!

Audrey

What happens when you try to sign in?

tejas aeoe

errors

tejas aeoe

i can tell u why, but i prefer not having to

Audrey

Well I do need a little bit of information regarding what happens when you sign in so I can best help!

tejas aeoe

My machines were getting a bit slow.

tejas aeoe

So, I decided to install hackintosh on both of them, so now I can't sign into the icloud service.

tejas aeoe

Basically, I cleanwiped both of them.

tejas aeoe

Now, I have space to do my school work at the expense of not having an apple ID.

tejas aeoe

school work as in that night class programming

tejas aeoe

i have a day job

Audrey

Oh I see! Thanks for the information. In regards to “hackintosh” we definitely advise against using that because it can cause the unintended effects youre experiencing so my best advice would be to remove it.

tejas aeoe

I get that you advise using it, but I really needed the extra space to do my class work because programming.

Audrey

I definitely understand that for sure

tejas aeoe

Well, I still don't see my devices in icloud settings.

tejas aeoe

Umm???

Audrey

In regards to modifications like that though, we really do recommend removing it - that would be our workaround for you. I know thats not ideal but its going to be the solution.

tejas aeoe

It took me a day to reinstall macOS, and it's working so-far, so why not leave things that work alone?

Audrey

If you arent able to sign into iCloud, that wouldn’t be working at its optimal level. I do understand why you have it on for sure though!

tejas aeoe

Sure, but I can sign into specific applications one-by-one, but I would like to sign in to icloud to use services such as find my mac.

tejas aeoe

Therefore I'm requesting you to add those devices to the icloud settings page.

tejas aeoe

I ain't got forever, It's almost midnight: eastern daylight time.

Audrey

I definitely understand! But, I’m not able to access your personal iCloud settings. Thats not a tool that we have. Your iCloud settings are personal to you and Apple takes privacy very seriously. So to use those services, we would need you to sign in from your end

tejas aeoe

O...k, but how do I get my devices to show up?

tejas aeoe

I gave you my serial numbers.

tejas aeoe

Me:F5KLV0H8F693

tejas aeoe

C02LJ41LFH00

Audrey

If you sign into iCloud from your devices, they will show up. If you aren’t able to sign in, thats going to be due to the modifications you have and we suggest removing them. I’m not able to add it from my end.

tejas aeoe

\-\_-

tejas aeoe

So, implicitly, you're saying that you can't do anything because I have hackintosh installed.

tejas aeoe

Come on, can't you find any workarounds?

tejas aeoe

I'm a customer of your serivce, please grant me that service.

tejas aeoe

I would like to use icloud on the web browser.

Audrey

Even if you didnt have hackintosh installed, we still cant add them for you. Hackintosh is what is preventing you from using iCloud services. If I could add them remotely, believe me I certainly would!

tejas aeoe

Do you have a supervisor?

Audrey

Yes I do! I am chatting with them now and just updating them on whats going on!

tejas aeoe

Please transfer me to them.

Audrey

Certainly! I have them on the line here - her name is Monica. Transferring now!

Monica

Thanks for contacting Apple Support. My name is Monica. Please give me a moment to look over your information.

tejas aeoe

Hello

tejas aeoe

Umm...

Monica

Greetings from Idaho, Tejas! My name is Monica and I'm a Senior Advisor here at Apple. I just want to let you know that it is my ultimate goal to help find the best resolution today. Before we get started, just to make sure I have the correct information, what is the best email I can use to send you the case details at the end of our chat?

tejas aeoe

I'm the guy with 2 devices running hackintosh and want to register them to icloud, please help me.

tejas aeoe

Here's the serial numbers.

tejas aeoe

C02LJ41LFH00

tejas aeoe

F5KLV0H8F693

Monica

Thank you so I would be happy to share the steps. There is not a way for me to remotely add the devices for you. So to confirm your not able to add either device to iCloud due to modifications from Hackintosh, is that correct?

tejas aeoe

Yes

tejas aeoe

But I own the devices

tejas aeoe

I would like to claim the 5GB

tejas aeoe

on icloud

Monica

Ah okay I am not familiar with Hackintosh so I would not be able to comment on that. We do recommend not using unauthorized medications as they can cause many issues. If it is not allowing you to sign into iCloud it would be best to remove those modifications to able to do so.

Monica

Even with our account security team by phone there is not a way to add the device on our end via iCloud. It has to be done but signing into the device with your Apple ID on iCloud.com

tejas aeoe

I give you conscent to add the 2 devices I mentioned.

tejas aeoe

consent\*

tejas aeoe

Do you have a supervisor or somoene you now in the security team?

tejas aeoe

I know the password to my apple account

Monica

I would not have the ability to sign in for you for security reasons this would be something that has to be done on your end with your Apple ID and password.

Monica

This is something you should never give out to anyone and Apple would never ask you for it.

tejas aeoe

This is my first support experience, and so far it hasn't been very great.

Monica

Our account security team will also be unable to add your devices via iCloud for you we have safety procedures in place and this is something we do have to follow.

tejas aeoe

Just do something and make it work.

Monica

Sorry you feel that this is for your protection as we do take safety issues very seriously.

Monica

We are happy to help you login on your end to iCloud but would require removing hackintosh to do so.

tejas aeoe

Have you seen ""Steve Jobs: The man in the machine"" documentary

Monica

I have the same level of authority as a supervisor or manager. I am fully empowered to make decisions on behalf of Apple for any Service or Support options. I have looked over the case and provided Apple’s final answer. From here there is no further escalation and no one I can transfer to will provide a different answer.

tejas aeoe

You see, steve would do this for me

tejas aeoe

Steve cared that his products were perfect

tejas aeoe

He wanted them to be

tejas aeoe

Yet, in contrast there was this hell around him he tried to fix

Monica

We do welcome feedback. If you would like to provide feedback about your device, a certain feature or policy. You can submit feedback about this at [apple.com/feedback](http://apple.com/feedback). We have a team here at Apple, who’s entire job is dedicated to reviewing this feedback, so you can rest assured that your voice will be heard!

tejas aeoe

If he was here, he'd do whatever he could to make sure all his customers are happy.

tejas aeoe

He'd do anything, including breaking the law, the same way he drew his silver mecedes with no licence plate.

tejas aeoe

drove\*

Monica

Our policies in place were the same with Steve Jobs so there is not a change. This is the same process as before. We will do all we can to help you trouble shoot and fix an issue as this time it does require removing the un-authorized modifications.

tejas aeoe

This is why apple has taken a turn for the worse.

tejas aeoe

I want to be that steve jobs and change apple.

tejas aeoe

for the better

tejas aeoe

so go out and fix my issue

tejas aeoe

Also, yes i'm filling out the feedback form

Monica

Awesome if that link did not work it is also here, [Product Feedback - Apple](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) We do appreciate your feedback and due to safety and security there is not a way to login here. If you do wish to remove the un-authorized medications I would be happy to help you login on your end to iCloud.

Monica

Is that something you would be willing to do?

tejas aeoe

my macbook pro isn't listed so i'm putting it under the new touch bar maccbook pros if that is fine with u

tejas aeoe

u ok with that

tejas aeoe

also i'm putting it under the imac pro

tejas aeoe

cuz my device isn't listed here, why apple pls support older devices for feedback

tejas aeoe

you support that damn time capsule, but you don't support a 2013 mbp

Monica

That is okay you can make notes as our engineering team does take time to read those.

tejas aeoe

yes, please let them know

tejas aeoe

they messed up big time

Monica

We support all devices here unless the device is vintage or obsolete which means it is over 5 years old.

tejas aeoe

my device isn't listed under feedback so i put the review under the new touch bar maccbook pro

tejas aeoe

my device is 5 years old

tejas aeoe

it should be supported

Monica

Sure not to worry. As long as you share the case number we have the notes and chat saved here.

tejas aeoe

Can you do that for me since you are at apple and have direct access to apple staff and facilities?

tejas aeoe

Don't you want to make a change for the better at apple?

tejas aeoe

Get to that 1 trillion market cap and make dem share holders happy?

tejas aeoe

You won't ever get there if you don't start supporting your customers.

Monica

Okay devices over 5 years are considered vintage and obsolete, so that could explain it. [Vintage and obsolete products - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201624) Since support options are very limited.

tejas aeoe

Regardless if their products are vintage

Monica

I can make feedback for you but it is always good to submit your feedback as well.

tejas aeoe

really 5 years and my $4000 laptop is ""VINTAGE""

Monica

We do support our customers and have offered the option I am able in order to assist you here.

Monica

We do offer limited support when a device is vintage so we do our best to assist a customer even for those devices.

tejas aeoe

Hey, stop it, my laptop isn't in the vintage list

tejas aeoe

you should have supported it

tejas aeoe

better

tejas aeoe

2013 macbook pro isn't listed there

tejas aeoe

i hate this ""vintage"" stuff

tejas aeoe

you guys gotta fix that for sure

Monica

I have give you the option available to help. Since we have covered the option to assist you with removing un-authorized modifications to help you login to iCloud on your devices. Since you declined to do so this is Apple Final Answer on this. So we still will support you if you do decide to. If you chat back in, our answer will be the same.

tejas aeoe

people make their devices last as long as possible

Monica

Thanks again I will be ending the chat as I have given Apple Final answer on this. Thanks for being part of the Apple Family. Good night.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;VINTAGE LAPTOP??? WTF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, implicitly, you&amp;#39;re saying that you can&amp;#39;t do anything because I have hackintosh installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on, can&amp;#39;t you find any workarounds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a customer of your serivce, please grant me that service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to use icloud on the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you didnt have hackintosh installed, we still cant add them for you. Hackintosh is what is preventing you from using iCloud services. If I could add them remotely, believe me I certainly would!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a supervisor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I do! I am chatting with them now and just updating them on whats going on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please transfer me to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly! I have them on the line here - her name is Monica. Transferring now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for contacting Apple Support. My name is Monica. Please give me a moment to look over your information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Idaho, Tejas! My name is Monica and I&amp;#39;m a Senior Advisor here at Apple. I just want to let you know that it is my ultimate goal to help find the best resolution today. Before we get started, just to make sure I have the correct information, what is the best email I can use to send you the case details at the end of our chat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the guy with 2 devices running hackintosh and want to register them to icloud, please help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the serial numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C02LJ41LFH00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F5KLV0H8F693&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so I would be happy to share the steps. There is not a way for me to remotely add the devices for you. So to confirm your not able to add either device to iCloud due to modifications from Hackintosh, is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I own the devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to claim the 5GB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on icloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah okay I am not familiar with Hackintosh so I would not be able to comment on that. We do recommend not using unauthorized medications as they can cause many issues. If it is not allowing you to sign into iCloud it would be best to remove those modifications to able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with our account security team by phone there is not a way to add the device on our end via iCloud. It has to be done but signing into the device with your Apple ID on iCloud.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give you conscent to add the 2 devices I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;consent*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a supervisor or somoene you now in the security team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the password to my apple account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not have the ability to sign in for you for security reasons this would be something that has to be done on your end with your Apple ID and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something you should never give out to anyone and Apple would never ask you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first support experience, and so far it hasn&amp;#39;t been very great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our account security team will also be unable to add your devices via iCloud for you we have safety procedures in place and this is something we do have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just do something and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry you feel that this is for your protection as we do take safety issues very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to help you login on your end to iCloud but would require removing hackintosh to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen &amp;quot;Steve Jobs: The man in the machine&amp;quot; documentary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the same level of authority as a supervisor or manager. I am fully empowered to make decisions on behalf of Apple for any Service or Support options. I have looked over the case and provided Apple’s final answer. From here there is no further escalation and no one I can transfer to will provide a different answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, steve would do this for me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve cared that his products were perfect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted them to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, in contrast there was this hell around him he tried to fix&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do welcome feedback. If you would like to provide feedback about your device, a certain feature or policy. You can submit feedback about this at &lt;a href=""http://apple.com/feedback""&gt;apple.com/feedback&lt;/a&gt;. We have a team here at Apple, who’s entire job is dedicated to reviewing this feedback, so you can rest assured that your voice will be heard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he was here, he&amp;#39;d do whatever he could to make sure all his customers are happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d do anything, including breaking the law, the same way he drew his silver mecedes with no licence plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;drove*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our policies in place were the same with Steve Jobs so there is not a change. This is the same process as before. We will do all we can to help you trouble shoot and fix an issue as this time it does require removing the un-authorized modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why apple has taken a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be that steve jobs and change apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so go out and fix my issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, yes i&amp;#39;m filling out the feedback form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome if that link did not work it is also here, &lt;a href=""https://www.apple.com/feedback/""&gt;Product Feedback - Apple&lt;/a&gt; We do appreciate your feedback and due to safety and security there is not a way to login here. If you do wish to remove the un-authorized medications I would be happy to help you login on your end to iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that something you would be willing to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my macbook pro isn&amp;#39;t listed so i&amp;#39;m putting it under the new touch bar maccbook pros if that is fine with u&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;u ok with that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also i&amp;#39;m putting it under the imac pro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cuz my device isn&amp;#39;t listed here, why apple pls support older devices for feedback&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you support that damn time capsule, but you don&amp;#39;t support a 2013 mbp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is okay you can make notes as our engineering team does take time to read those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, please let them know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they messed up big time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support all devices here unless the device is vintage or obsolete which means it is over 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my device isn&amp;#39;t listed under feedback so i put the review under the new touch bar maccbook pro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my device is 5 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it should be supported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure not to worry. As long as you share the case number we have the notes and chat saved here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you do that for me since you are at apple and have direct access to apple staff and facilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t you want to make a change for the better at apple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get to that 1 trillion market cap and make dem share holders happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t ever get there if you don&amp;#39;t start supporting your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay devices over 5 years are considered vintage and obsolete, so that could explain it. &lt;a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201624""&gt;Vintage and obsolete products - Apple Support&lt;/a&gt; Since support options are very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless if their products are vintage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can make feedback for you but it is always good to submit your feedback as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;really 5 years and my $4000 laptop is &amp;quot;VINTAGE&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do support our customers and have offered the option I am able in order to assist you here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do offer limited support when a device is vintage so we do our best to assist a customer even for those devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, stop it, my laptop isn&amp;#39;t in the vintage list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should have supported it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 macbook pro isn&amp;#39;t listed there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hate this &amp;quot;vintage&amp;quot; stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you guys gotta fix that for sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have give you the option available to help. Since we have covered the option to assist you with removing un-authorized modifications to help you login to iCloud on your devices. Since you declined to do so this is Apple Final Answer on this. So we still will support you if you do decide to. If you chat back in, our answer will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tejas aeoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;people make their devices last as long as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again I will be ending the chat as I have given Apple Final answer on this. Thanks for being part of the Apple Family. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

He purchased the most expensive computer in the store and pushed his way past the employee at the desk into the backroom, the employee asked him what he was doing and he replied ""I'm Steve Jobs you piece of shit"" before entering the employee restroom with the Microsoft computer. When he came out I could tell he had had sex with it, its screen was cracked. He had blood all over his pants. Cum was on the screen. Not to mention I could hear him in there.




""Let's get back to the office now"" he told me, panting. As we walked out to the car he shouted ""SHOTGUN!"" giddily, even though we were the only 2 people left.




The drive back to Apple consisted of him giggling and talking about how much greater Apple was than Microsoft.




I thought for sure he wouldn't get away with it this time, but he did. Another man replaced the employee he murdered the next day and the office pretended it didn't happen.

Below is an attempted submission to the Apple communities, where I was vaguely hoping to get help on a problem my MacBook Pro is experiencing. Apple blocked me even before I could post the comment. I don't think that was a bug, but rather they are monitoring the draft as it is prepared. Rather than doing something helpful like routing me to useful prior discussions, they are using it for a new kind of spam filtering, preventing the expression of negative sentiments about Apple. (Anyone else have any similar experiences to share?)

""How to write a good question"" starts by asking me to spend a lot of time gathering irrelevant information. If there is anything that is relevant in the details requested in the first two steps, explain why. I believe it suffices to say the machine is fully updated and the problem is obviously in Apple's system software. Therefore I am proceeding to the third step of describing the problem, which is easily done.

I click on App Store and then click on the Updates button. Nothing happens for several minutes. Then it announces an error has occurred with the more detailed explanation ""Can't load data from the Apple Software Update server.""

The machine has been in this state for some months. There is no obvious cause, and it is also clear that the error message is misleading or false. For example, the latest iTunes version 12.7 has been installed recently, though the error message appeared before that installation and still appears now. Obviously the computer is getting the data from the Apple Software Update server, but doesn't want MY interference in the process. Perhaps it's just a matter of Apple preferring to schedule things for its inhuman corporate convenience rather than mine.

Now the fourth step of ""How to write a good question"" says to list the troubleshooting steps. I could already write a novella-length treatment, but I'll just list a few highlights. Tried alternative networks. Searched on the Web outside of Apple. Searched inside the Apple support website. Finally reduced to searching inside these Discussions.

Inside the discussions I found a number of threads that cited the exact error message. None of them solved the problem (even if the problem is only of the misleading appearance of a problem). Some of them were unanswered. The best described accessing the system logs. Though those directions turned out to be incorrect, I figured out an alternative way, but still couldn't find anything helpful in the logs.

Based on my past experience with Apple's so-called support and these so-called discussions, I am NOT expecting any help here. The main result of my prior experiences has been to persuade me that I never want to buy another Apple product. However, sometimes in the course of trying to describe a problem I figure out what's wrong. So far that hasn't happened... Maybe the angle of Apple taking over control of upgrades on the computer I supposedly own?

Now I have a prediction for how this discussion goes. It will NOT go well. That's mostly because my skeptical attitude is forbidden here. I'm going to publicly post this problem description elsewhere, because I think the most likely response to this part of the comment will be to delete the comment unanswered. If it does get an answer, it will be another boilerplate response from some fanboi trying to earn some kind of brownie points from Apple. That boilerplate will be pitched at total neophytes and will just waste more of my time.

Now if there is a helpful discussion, I promise to repost it in the same venue, but... I'm certainly not expecting any help from Apple or its minions now. If there is a problem (and I'm still uncertain), then I will have to solve it on my own (as I have done on many occasions already, though some annoying problems remain open). I certainly hope Apple is not expecting me to buy another Apple product. EVER. Whenever my resolve weakens, something like this wannabe problem restores it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is even more EVIL than I thought.

&lt;p&gt;The machine has been in this state for some months. There is no obvious cause, and it is also clear that the error message is misleading or false. For example, the latest iTunes version 12.7 has been installed recently, though the error message appeared before that installation and still appears now. Obviously the computer is getting the data from the Apple Software Update server, but doesn&amp;#39;t want MY interference in the process. Perhaps it&amp;#39;s just a matter of Apple preferring to schedule things for its inhuman corporate convenience rather than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the fourth step of &amp;quot;How to write a good question&amp;quot; says to list the troubleshooting steps. I could already write a novella-length treatment, but I&amp;#39;ll just list a few highlights. Tried alternative networks. Searched on the Web outside of Apple. Searched inside the Apple support website. Finally reduced to searching inside these Discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the discussions I found a number of threads that cited the exact error message. None of them solved the problem (even if the problem is only of the misleading appearance of a problem). Some of them were unanswered. The best described accessing the system logs. Though those directions turned out to be incorrect, I figured out an alternative way, but still couldn&amp;#39;t find anything helpful in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my past experience with Apple&amp;#39;s so-called support and these so-called discussions, I am NOT expecting any help here. The main result of my prior experiences has been to persuade me that I never want to buy another Apple product. However, sometimes in the course of trying to describe a problem I figure out what&amp;#39;s wrong. So far that hasn&amp;#39;t happened... Maybe the angle of Apple taking over control of upgrades on the computer I supposedly own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have a prediction for how this discussion goes. It will NOT go well. That&amp;#39;s mostly because my skeptical attitude is forbidden here. I&amp;#39;m going to publicly post this problem description elsewhere, because I think the most likely response to this part of the comment will be to delete the comment unanswered. If it does get an answer, it will be another boilerplate response from some fanboi trying to earn some kind of brownie points from Apple. That boilerplate will be pitched at total neophytes and will just waste more of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if there is a helpful discussion, I promise to repost it in the same venue, but... I&amp;#39;m certainly not expecting any help from Apple or its minions now. If there is a problem (and I&amp;#39;m still uncertain), then I will have to solve it on my own (as I have done on many occasions already, though some annoying problems remain open). I certainly hope Apple is not expecting me to buy another Apple product. EVER. Whenever my resolve weakens, something like this wannabe problem restores it.&lt;/p&gt;

No. What it makes them be is a mindless iSheep in a huge iHerd of (mostly American or Western European) upper-class people that cult-follow a company whose income they bloat and which profits from their vanity.

iSheep don't consider any other option than Apple products when they buy something. I’m afraid that using an Android phone or a Windows or Linux PC will begin to be seen as a sign of being poor, having bad taste (not saying that iSheep have good tastes...) or just being a weirdo.

Also, has anybody noticed that, in stock photos, the products people use are from Apple? That, when teenage girls are taking a hot photo of themselves in the bathroom mirror with the phone in their hands, it's always an iPhone? That most developers launch their apps on iOS first and then on Android (not to talk about Windows Phone...)? That pictures of apps and websites are on iPhones and Macs? That when people gift a mobile phone to an old person without tech skills, it’s an iPhone? That the world of app development is an oligarchy dominated by iPhones, even if less than a quarter of smartphones are iPhones? WHY THIS IDIOCRACY???

However, unlike other people on this sub, I don't think Apple products are awful. I don't hate Apple for making bad products. I hate them for their stupid customers and for those who overrate their products. I think the Apple fanboyism should be limited and that people should open their eyes and see the multitude of awesome Android phones that there are, and stop being close minded. Guys, if you have the money to buy a fancy iPhone, you definitely have the money to buy another great phone.
