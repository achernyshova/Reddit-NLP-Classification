This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/94o0hn/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xix/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Hello AskScience! Today at approximately 10:30am local time, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake occurred in Southern California. The epicenter of the earthquake was in a remote area between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, though the quake was felt widely across the region. It is the strongest earthquake in the area in two decades. The AskScience team would like to extend our condolences to anyone negatively affected by this event.

Perhaps I've mis-remembered something but - The way wave-particle duality works with light is that - it will remain in wave form, traveling a the speed of light (without mass) and the waveform will collapse upon 'observation'.

This to me means one of the following things:

A: Our observation of event horizon of a black hole causes the waveform to collapse and particles to be absorbed

B: Black hole can pull waves into itself

C: Black holes 'pull' speed is so fast that technically the light red-shifts until it goes out of visible spectrum - without covering any of the distance due to moving opposite the black holes pull.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if any of the above are correct... Would someone be able to mildly clarify this for me?

National stats say that about [5% of Americans identify as something other than heterosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States). 

However, out of our 16 boys, 10 of them openly identify as something other than heterosexual. Everything from Bisexual to transsexual. And that number is fairly low. It's common for us to only have one or two who identify as, and behave as, heterosexual. 

If their sexual identity was not at all tied to their past as victims of sexual trauma (again, the only trait I can think of that they all share), then you would expect their LGBT numbers to roughly match the national average because as far as that demographic is concerned, we'd be essentially taking a random sample from among them, but apparently we are not. The numbers hover more around 60-100% LGBT.

I realize that even if we take every kid Ive ever worked with over my years in this job, it would still be a small sample size, but its enough of a pattern that it makes me wonder if theres any sort of connection.

My name is Alicia McGrew, and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Florida.

My PhD research at the University of Florida is focused on the food web that lives inside the leaves of a carnivorous pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea).  Florida is the carnivorous plant hotspot of North America; however, this particular pitcher plant is unique, as it relies on a community of aquatic micro-organisms to help decompose its prey and acquire important nutrients for growth.

I use this model food web to ask a number of questions about ecological communities:  which organisms are there, how do they interact, and how does this composition and structure vary across different ecological and environmental conditions?  I'm particularly interested in the role of nutrients and predation on structuring aquatic communities.

I'm from Michigan, and first began doing research on aquatic communities in the Great Lakes region, where I spent many hours on a microscope!  I worked as a technician to sample and identify zooplankton taxa in a variety of habitats.  For my Master's research, I investigated the feeding ecology of an aquatic invasive species to the Great Lakes region, the bloody red shrimp.

When I'm not doing science, my other interests include teaching, reading, gardening (including a mini pitcher plant bog!), traveling, and hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently wondering why this happens over and over despite me cleaning those two metals every time. I'm fidgeting with two metals disks, rubbing them together with two fingers for no real reason. One disk is certainly made of Mu-metal or similar (Coming from a high-end speaker magnet. Is not a magnet itself.) and the other disk is made from a hard, cast iron (I can barely work it with a file), that is creating yellow salts in a oxalic acid peroxide solution. (I'm sure it's Iron oxalate) So it is mostly iron.

The Mu-metal disk does not stick to the other disk, but it does when I've rubbed them together until the sludge appears. It holds on when turned on top.

I am not touching the surfaces that rub together.

I also ruled out charges because I rubbed them together while having them both connected via a copper cable.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""sludge"" appears as a darker-than-the-metal coating/film that also feels fatty.

Kind regards

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: the Mu-metal disk could be coated in zinc. It is a pretty whiteish metal.

Edit2: Interestingly, one disk slowly glides down the other when there is enough ""sludge"" to hold the disk when turned on top. For some reason it feels odd how it glides down. It is a very constant and slow motion.

More: There is no magnetic attraction between the two at the point when they stick together. That's why I put this as a Chemistry question.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/).

Hi AskScience ! I was asked by a friend to try and draw a “celtic knot” with a specific number of intersection for the thread and a specific number of holes in it. Long story short : it’s hard. But while trying to do this, I wondered about her request : was it even possible ?

&amp;#x200B;

By celtic knot, I mean a finished line that does a loop, and intersect in various places with itself (in symmetrical patterns). Something like this for example : [https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/img/cms/celtic-love-knot.jpg](https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/img/cms/celtic-love-knot.jpg). In this example, we have 8 “holes’ and 7 intersections. I found a few tutorials and even generators, but they don’t really answer my question. There are some celtic knots with two or three or more threads, but it might complicate the matter for now so I'm not sure it's relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would like to know is : is there a way to be sure a combination of holes and intersections is possible or impossible inside a looped line ?

&amp;#x200B;

I can say for example I want 20 holes for two intersections : it obviously is impossible, but I don’t know how to prove it and apply it to the numbers my friend gave me. I have a feeling that it is kind of a similar thing than the “*How many colors does it take to paint every region without any two adjacent ones being the same color ?’* question, but i'm absolutely not a mathematician so I might be very wrong.

I read that UV-radiation breaks down methane, but I get the sense that this is not the explanation for why we see the sudden drop-offs of methane after a spike. Is that true? And how quickly would methane be broken down by UV-radiation alone on Mars? I heard a theory from a professor that dust storms could ""eat"" the methane.

This adds to the mystery of the Martian methane and there are some things I don&amp;#39;t understand. I read that UV-radiation breaks down methane, but I get the sense that this is not the explanation for why we see the sudden drop-offs of methane after a spike. Is that true? And how quickly would methane be broken down by UV-radiation alone on Mars? I heard a theory from a professor that dust storms could &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; the methane.

When a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his DNA becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(Metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells.

Most likely it would be slower than a correct guess in the current method, but it also removes the risk of being wrong. Is this currently employed? Would it require new processor technology that is not feasible currently? Do the prediction mechanisms guess correctly often enough that it would reduce speed to evaluate both branches? Is there another factor that I don&amp;#39;t know about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience""&gt;The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with &amp;#39;I think&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve heard&amp;#39;, then it&amp;#39;s not suitable for &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/""&gt;please refer to the information provided here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, one thing that's bugging me about this subject is how sub-cellular ""objects"" accomplish their functions which usually involve high level of complexity.

But HOW?

How does an mRNA even know where a ribosome is? And how come it's able to navigate toward such ribosome? You don't expect a rock to just appear on a table, right?

What I know is whenever an inanimate object moves toward its destination, there has to be some sort of physical mechanisms like a conveyor belt, gears, propellers, sensors, etc.

So are there similar things within a cell? Does the medium where these objects pass over contain similar mechanism or system to guide them to their destination?

And how about what the RNA polymerase is doing? 

Isn't synthesizing something from a template too complex which can only be done with humans or preprogrammed robots?

My name is Roger Hanlon, and I'm a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. I am a diving biologist who studies cephalopod behavior, especially camouflage &amp; signaling. I recently gave a [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_hanlon_the_amazing_brains_and_morphing_skin_of_octopuses_and_other_cephalopods) on the amazing brains and ""smart skin"" of octopuses and other cephalopods. My favorite cephalopod is Octopus cyanea, the ""day octopus"" of coral reefs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This critter is really clever and adaptable, and its coloration for camouflage and signaling is amazing even by cephalopod standards.

I'm Mike Vecchione, a NOAA scientist at the National Museum of Natural History. My current research focuses on the natural history of cephalopods, and marine biodiversity, especially in the deep sea. I have helped to make cephalopod information available on the web [here](http://tolweb.org/cephalopoda). My favorite cephalopod is any strange species from the deep sea because we are still discovering new stuff regularly.

Hello all, I'm Louise Allcock! I'm head of zoology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and I'm particularly interested in the evolution and ecology of cephalopods. My favourite cephalopod is *Thaumeledone guntheri*. It's a deep-sea species from around the island South Georgia. I like the pattern on its skin! Lots of deep-sea species appear to have their origins in Antarctica and I'm fascinated by this.

Would that also mean that [balloon analogy](http://www.oneminuteastronomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Balloon-Analogy.jpeg) is no longer applicable, since that analogy assumes that the universe curves onto itself?

For the purposes of my following questions, lets assume the universe is flat. This raises a few questions that I'm yet to see tackled:

2) A question of size - if the universe is infinite, that means it was always infinite. Adding or subtracting anything from infinity is still infinity. However the Big Bang theory states that the universe was somehow much ""smaller"" in the past (implying a size) and over time it got ""bigger"" and cooled....but the concept of bigger/smaller is not compatible with an infinite and flat universe. How does one reconcile the Big Bang with an infinite &amp; flat universe?

3) A question of time - how can an event that happened a finite amount of time ago in the past (the Big Bang) result in an infinite and flat universe?

4) A question of mass - galaxies seem to be uniformly distributed everywhere we look (on average). However all current theories state the universe has a finite amount of matter. How can a finite amount of matter be distributed uniformly over an infinite amount of space? Wouldn't there eventually be a point where matter simply ""ran out""?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) When I read that universe is most likely &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; (no higher-dimensional curvature), does that mean it has no measurable size and you could keep keep traveling in a straight line forever? Would that also mean that &lt;a href=""http://www.oneminuteastronomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Balloon-Analogy.jpeg""&gt;balloon analogy&lt;/a&gt; is no longer applicable, since that analogy assumes that the universe curves onto itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of my following questions, lets assume the universe is flat. This raises a few questions that I&amp;#39;m yet to see tackled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A question of size - if the universe is infinite, that means it was always infinite. Adding or subtracting anything from infinity is still infinity. However the Big Bang theory states that the universe was somehow much &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; in the past (implying a size) and over time it got &amp;quot;bigger&amp;quot; and cooled....but the concept of bigger/smaller is not compatible with an infinite and flat universe. How does one reconcile the Big Bang with an infinite &amp;amp; flat universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) A question of time - how can an event that happened a finite amount of time ago in the past (the Big Bang) result in an infinite and flat universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) A question of mass - galaxies seem to be uniformly distributed everywhere we look (on average). However all current theories state the universe has a finite amount of matter. How can a finite amount of matter be distributed uniformly over an infinite amount of space? Wouldn&amp;#39;t there eventually be a point where matter simply &amp;quot;ran out&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So from what I understand the goal is to create masks, which will later be used in photo-litography to create micro-chips. Is that correct? Because as far as I can tell this kind of maskless writing takes from 10-50 hrs PER MASK and that's waaay to slow to manufacture micro-chips themselves. But to create masks it might be just enough.

&amp;#x200B;

So can someone explain to me the basics steps? The way I see this now is:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get a silicon wafer
2. Put a resist on it
3. Write (without a mask) using an electron beam, anything you want on it.
4. Use something to dissolve the the rest of the resist such that only the part we illuminated with the e-beam remains on the silicon wafer.
5. Now we have created a mask.
6. Ship this mask to a micro-chip manufacturer.
7. The manufacturer will use photo-litography (regular light beam, short wavelenght) to illuminate the mask we shipped to him to create micro chips.

Is that more or less correct? Ps: I've noticed that some papers mention reverse e-beam litography. At what step of my list is that technology used?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But to create masks it might be just enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can someone explain to me the basics steps? The way I see this now is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a silicon wafer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a resist on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write (without a mask) using an electron beam, anything you want on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use something to dissolve the the rest of the resist such that only the part we illuminated with the e-beam remains on the silicon wafer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we have created a mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship this mask to a micro-chip manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The manufacturer will use photo-litography (regular light beam, short wavelenght) to illuminate the mask we shipped to him to create micro chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that more or less correct? Ps: I&amp;#39;ve noticed that some papers mention reverse e-beam litography. At what step of my list is that technology used?&lt;/p&gt;

We are a group of prion researchers working at the Centre for Prions &amp; Protein Folding Diseases (CPPFD) located on the University of Alberta Campus, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Prion diseases are a group of rare, neurodegerative diseases that are invariably fatal and for which we currently have no cure. Having come from the most recent international prion conference (Prion2019) and with prions being highlighted in the news (CWD – aka “Zombie Deer Disease”) we have decided to do an AMA to help clear some of the confusion/misinformation surrounding CWD, prions, and how they are transmitted.

With us today we have 5 of the professors/principle investigators (PI’s) here to answer questions. They are:

**Dr. David Westaway (PhD)** – Director of the CPPFD, Full Professor (Dept. Medicine – Div. Neurology), and Canadian Tier 1 Research Chair in Neurodegerative Diseases.

**Dr. Judd Aiken (PhD)** – Full Professor (Dept. Agriculture, Food and Nutritional Science), expert on CWD and environmental contamination of prions.

**Dr. Debbie McKenzie (PhD)** – Associate Professor (Dept. Biological Sciences), expert in CWD strains and spread.

**Dr. Holger Wille (PhD)** – Associate Professor (Dept. Biochemistry), expert in the study of the structure of native and misfolded prions.

**Dr. Valerie Sim (MD)** – Associate Professor (Dept. Medicine – Div. Neurology), Clinical Neurologist, and Medical Director of the Canadian CJD Association, expert on human prion disease.

/u/DNAhelicase is helping us arrange this AMA. He is the lab manager/senior research technician to Dr. Valerie Sim, and a long time Reddit user.

We will be here to answer questions at 1pm MST (3pm EST)

Let me elaborate a bit more. I can't really understand what my textbook is saying exactly.

So, let's say someone has a bacterial infection. Does the bacteria only exclusively travel through the tissues, or can it travel through the blood and into other tissues? Is septicemia different from bacteremia? I do not understand how an infection in the lungs can travel to the brain without entering the blood. Or can it do that, and just not affect the blood negatively to the point of septicemia?

I went to see my sister in Brighton (UK) on an unexpectedly hot day in May.

I decided to go for a swim in the sea - my brother declined saying the sea hadn’t heated up enough so he would wait until the summer

My understanding of heat entropy is that the sea doesn’t “heat up” over time like a slow cooker but has a temperature directly relating to the daily sun heat in a given area

My question is this: does the sea water heat over time or does the sea temperate depend on daily heat from night time (cold) to whatever sun temperature creates on any given day despite time of year?

What is a ""bubble""?  Good question. I mean I, an evil mad scientist, after petting my white cat and cursing Inspector Gadget, declare that the only way to stop my doomsday machine is with a huge bubble.

We are Sarah Stellwagen, a biology postdoc at UMBC, and Rebecca Renberg, a research scientist at the United States Army Research Laboratory. We're excited to share how we figured out how to sequence two incredibly challenging spider glue genes for the first time, and the possibilities this opens up for science.

Spider glue is a modified version of spider silk that keeps a spider's prey stuck in its web. Unlike silk, it's a liquid both inside and outside of the spider. Because of this, spider glue might be easier to produce in the lab than silk, which could lead to major advances in biomaterials. There are so many potential applications to explore in the future, such as using it to protect crops from pests instead of using insecticides. 

We'll be here to answer your questions at 11:30 a.m. EDT / 8:30 a.m. PDT

**1. The Moon**

&gt;u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup &amp; Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk &amp; Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

&gt; u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
&gt;  
&gt;u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

&gt; u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

&gt;u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
&gt;  
&gt;Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

&gt;u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
&gt;
&gt;u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/dream-factory/201712/do-blind-people-see-in-their-dreams%3famp

Don't know how thorough was the study but if they're comparing to MRI's in fetuses I'm pretty sure a lot of hard work has gone into it. Website is psychology and not a journal of peer reviewed so here I am asking redditors.

My big question is the following:
If there are blind people from birth that are having visualizations (let's call it seeing) in their dreams, how can we prove they see the same as us by communicating with our other senses between blind person/non blind person?
(By ""same as us"" I'm implying like a movie in front of us at eye level).

There must be a technical word that encompasses what I'm trying to ask (or even a philosophical term most likely).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking about people blind from birth.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Lasers can be focused arbitrarily bright and hot because the source is effectively negative temperature (population inversion, etc), so thermodynamics doesn't object to it being arbitrarily focused.

But... I don't see where in the process of a radio transmitter is there anything analogous to population inversion, anything that that'd be negative temperature.

Only thing I can think of is the antenna itself in that effectively what's in it is a single mode wave nicely radiating. If some small chunk of the antenna suddenly dissipated extra energy, that'd increase the entropy in the antenna.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of why the sky turns red during sunrise/sunset is as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. 

During sunrise and sunset (Figures 1 and 3), sunlight has to travel far through the atmosphere due to its angle relative to Earth's surface. 

As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it hits molecules and scatter, losing blue light in the process - sky is red. 

During midday, distance sunlight travels is lot shorter, it retains its blue light - sky is blue. 

However, if the longitudinal angle differences (time of day) and its affect on distances sunlight travel through the atmosphere ('atmospheric thickness') is the only reason why sky turns red during sunrise and sunset, why doesn't latitudinal angle differences affect the color in the same way?

&amp;#x200B;

Consider Figures 4 through 8 are at a constant longitudinal angle (same time of day).  

The northern hemisphere (lets say northern Europe) and the equator (lets say central Africa) are located on same longitude (i.e. their time zones are the same). 

During summer (Figures 4 and 5), northern Europe is not located at a latitudinal severe enough to affect distance of atmosphere sunlight has to travel - color of the sky is only affected by time of day. 

However during winter (Figure 6), sunlight has to travel the through same 'thickness' of atmosphere that it travels during sunset (Figure 3).

Therefore, during winter, the specific part of northern Europe I marked in Figures 6 and 8 should see the red sky, all day. 

And if two people are to take a picture in northern Europe and central Africa at the same time, the sky should be colored red and blue, respectively. 

But from my understanding, this is not the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earth is (almost) a sphere so any affect longitudinal angles have on 'atmospheric thickness' should be (almost) the same for latitudinal angles. 

I was thinking that maybe I could answer myself if I can picture everything in 3D, instead of just 2D as shown in my Figures. 

So longitudinal and latitudinal angles must be combined to create 'atmospheric thickness' severe enough have drastic changes in color. 

However, this is clearly not the case since latitudinal angles have little to no impact on longitudinal angles with respect to the color of the sky. 

If its time of sunrise, midday, or sunset, the colors will be same for northern Europe and central Africa. 

Sure, duration of the day are different, but the color of the sky will still be red during sunrise/sunset and blue when its midday for both places. 

If I could freeze time at 12 pm, and look up to the sky at central Africa, the sky will be blue. 

If I travel north (time still frozen), I should be seeing the sun 'setting' to the south, where one point it will be near the horizon and the sky should be red, even when its 12 pm. 

And at this location, the sky should be red all the time, as long as the sun is up, at certain time of the year (winter for northern Europe). 

I've heard of midnight sun and extremely short/long day and night time but never a place that experience red sky for a whole day, maybe I'm just ignorant on that regards.
