Welcome to [r/dogfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfree)! We invite you to participate in our discussions. First, however, whether you are new to our sub or a dog lover who just doesn’t quite understand where we are coming from, please take the time to read our sub FAQs so you can come to understand our community and the type of content that is appropriate for our small but mightily active corner of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why don't you like dogs?**

Because: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/7bk3wo/just\_curious\_what\_is\_the\_reason\_why\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/7bk3wo/just_curious_what_is_the_reason_why_you/)

&amp;#x200B;

**I created a post asking why you don’t like dogs. Where did it go?**

We receive and remove this question just about daily. This is our community’s space to vent and commiserate about an unpopular opinion, not a place where we come to feel burdened with the task of having to justify ourselves constantly. If you would like to know why we don’t like dogs, you may read the link above and/or put some time and effort into browsing our sub.

&amp;#x200B;

**I like dogs. Am I welcome here?**

As with anything, there's no one-size-fits-all reason we don't like dogs. Anyone is welcome to post here, even those who love dogs, so long as you are posting here in good faith without trying to convert anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you feel about service dogs?** 

There is a spectrum of opinions about service dogs in this sub.  Some people are completely okay with them, while others are opposed where technology can do the job in a more effective, less obtrusive manner.  If you would like to find out more information about this sub's opinions on service dogs, instead of creating a new post to pose the question, please enter ""service dogs"" into the search bar to search the sub.  

&amp;#x200B;

**It seems like the problem you all have is really more with dog owners. So you really do like dogs, just not irresponsible owners, right?**

Our opinions vary widely, so in some cases, maybe that's the case. However, true to the name of our sub, and though it might be a tough pill to swallow, most of us simply *don’t like dogs.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Someone on Reddit said that this sub likes to murder dogs. Is that true?**

Of course not! We span a wide spectrum of reasons for disliking dogs, but we do not wish harm upon them and often find aspects of dog ownership to be more cruel and unethical than do dog owners themselves. In fact, we have a strict sub rule against content that advocates animal abuse of any kind. It reads: “Self-defense discussion is acceptable. Celebrating, depicting, or suggesting animal abuse is not.” We take this rule more seriously than any other, and we err on the side of caution when it comes to removing this type of content.

Some examples of off-limits content include videos depicting gratuitous violence against or amongst dogs, discussion of eating dogs, suggestions of deriving pleasure from a dog's death, and references to hitting, kicking, or shooting a dog with little or no cause.

It is okay to discuss self-defense measures and the justified, humane euthanization of dogs. If you have a graphic video you want to share, create a thoughtful text post about the point you'd like to make and link the video to supplement your point. If you've had to live with a significant other's dog for years and wish to express relief over its natural passing, that's okay. Really, context is everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**I posted a dog-related screenshot of something I saw on social media. Why isn’t it showing up?**

Our community is small but *extremely* active. As the amount of content can be increasingly overwhelming as the sub grows, it’s important that the meaningful discussion does not get lost. Therefore, we have a sub rule that reads “\[s\]ubmissions should be thoughtful and should promote quality discussion. News articles and text posts are encouraged. Pictures of dogs or dog-related items, videos of dogs doing gross things, social media screenshots, memes, title-only posts, posts with minimal text, and anything that might be found on [r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww) are some examples of low-effort content that do not contribute anything of value to the conversation.

Memes and comics are at home over at our sister sub, [r/dogfreehumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfreehumor).”

If you would like to post a social media screenshot or anything else that might fall under this category, create a thoughtful text post addressing the core issue in order to open the discussion. You may link to your screenshot as supporting evidence. It is important to remember that names, subreddits, titles, group names, and any other identifying information should be blocked out entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

[**r/dogfreehumor**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfreehumor)**?! That’s interesting - tell me more!**

[r/dogfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfree) is historically a discussion-based sub that aims to tackle dog-related issues in the world around us through thoughtful conversation. At the same time, there is a demand for memes and other types of humor. We created [r/dogfreehumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfreehumor) in order to streamline content and give everyone an outlet for everything that they want without detracting from the discussion. Subscribe, contribute, help us grow, and enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**I think it would be fun to make a rude comment to a dog lover in another subreddit and tag** [**r/dogfree**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfree)**. That's a good idea, right?**

No, and please don’t. We encourage positive, civil, thoughtful conversation about dogs wherever you go, but if you need a vent, keep it here. When you troll other places on Reddit, it invites unwanted attention, reinforces negative stereotypes, and impedes our ability to create change in the world. *This community is better than that.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Do I have to feel a certain way about keeping other pets or about having children to participate?**

The topic that unites us in this sub is dogs. Feelings about other types of pets, negative or positive, and decisions whether or not to have children are considered off-topic for the sub. That said, these topics will arise in the normal course of conversation. We should respect the wide variance in views on these topics and always treat those with differing opinions kindly.

At the end of the day, we are dog-free, and we are pro-human.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I be a certain race or of a certain political affiliation to participate?**

One of the coolest things about [r/dogfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogfree) is that, in a world that’s so divided along so many different lines, this is a community where we can come together, break down those barriers, and unite over something different with people from all walks of life. Just as dog culture transcends racial, political, socioeconomic, and gender lines, so does this subreddit. You may even find that your reasoning for something dog-related challenges your views on something completely unrelated.

This community strives to be respectful of all groups of people. As such, bigotry is not allowed, and political discussion is divisive and off-topic. Dogs? Fair game!

&amp;#x200B;

**That’s great! Do you have any information about the demographics of those who participate in this subreddit?**

Why yes! If you haven’t already, you can [take our survey here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTaGeFPpizX3l_kquZBSqXjky1eFdEubIgBplUSi4FTprrnA/viewform)

Check back as the sub grows.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why all the pit bull hate?**

As much as we dislike dogs, we especially dislike this class of dogs that is statistically most capable of and responsible for inflicting catastrophic and often lethal harm upon people and their pets. You can apologize for pit bulls all day, but the stats and anecdotes don’t lie.

Of course, it is also true that all dogs bite: [Dog Bite Statistics](https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-quick-statistics.php)

&amp;#x200B;

**I know how I feel about pit bulls, but I need some additional information so I can make more articulate arguments.   Where should I go?**

For more specialized information on the topic of pit bulls, please visit [r/banpitbulls](https://www.reddit.com/r/banpitbulls).    We have a very friendly relationship with r/banpitbulls, but please do remember that, while our subs overlap in many ways, we still have different objectives.   Many people participate in that sub because they are tired of worrying about their own dogs getting mauled.   Please feel free to go join the conversation over there, but remember that it is not r/dogfree and that the topic of discussion is pit bulls.  Come back here to our own sub to talk about your distaste for dogs in general.

&amp;#x200B;

**I saw some Facebook groups and YouTube channels about disliking dogs.  Is that you guys?**

Nope, the only groups run by this sub are r/dogfree and r/dogfreehumor.  We don't operate or endorse any YouTube channels, Facebook groups, or anything else on any other social media platform.  Our subscribers may link to their content here as long as it follows sub rules, but we are unaffiliated.

&amp;#x200B;

**I saw a post I don’t like.  What should I do?**

Report it! On any post or comment, there is a “report” button. It will prompt you for further information as to why you are reporting the content to the moderators, who will then review it and determine whether or not it should be stay or be removed. Reports are anonymous and very helpful, as we can't see everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**Someone alluded to a conversation in another subreddit about dogs, and I really want to go down vote everything. Should I?**

No, please don’t. This is called “brigading” or “vote manipulation,” and it is against Reddit’s Terms of Service. We actively discourage this behavior, as if we are found to be the source of a brigade against another sub, it could land us in big trouble. If you stumbled across a reference to another conversation on Reddit, the appropriate place to discuss that would be here, in our sub, in the thread in which you found it. Remember how it felt when a YouTuber made a video that resulted in a massive brigade against us; we must grant others the same respect for their space as we wish for ours, no matter how vehemently we disagree with them.

Our sub is committed to abiding by all [Reddit Terms of Service.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)

&amp;#x200B;

**I want to crosspost something from another part of Reddit. May I?**

Usually no. If you crosspost something, it will go to a queue for moderator review. What we are looking for is whether or not the crosspost will incite drama between our sub and another. If we think the temptation for our sub to locate the post and participate would be too strong, we’ll decline it.

&amp;#x200B;

**My post mysteriously disappeared, and I don’t feel like I broke any rules. Why?**

Unfortunately we cannot account for every contingency in the sub rules, so moderators do reserve the right to remove content at their discretion. That said, the moderation team is very much against arbitrary censorship and is committed to letting the conversation happen whenever possible. “I don’t like it” is not a good reason to remove a post or a comment; however, “it would be in the best interest of the community” is. The team is committed to being firm but fair in community moderation and will make all decisions in good faith.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to get to know our community! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to message the mod team.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not soulless, hateful, empty people.&lt;/p&gt;

You can apologize for pit bulls all day, but the stats and anecdotes don’t lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.candogseat-this.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dogs-aggressiveness-and-breed.png""&gt;Aggression Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://blog.dogsbite.org/2008/08/triggers-what-prompts-pit-bull-to.html""&gt;Pit Bull Triggers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-multi-year-fatality-report-2005-2017.php""&gt;Pit Bull Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is also true that all dogs bite: &lt;a href=""https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-quick-statistics.php""&gt;Dog Bite Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know how I feel about pit bulls, but I need some additional information so I can make more articulate arguments.   Where should I go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more specialized information on the topic of pit bulls, please visit &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/banpitbulls""&gt;r/banpitbulls&lt;/a&gt;.    We have a very friendly relationship with &lt;a href=""/r/banpitbulls""&gt;r/banpitbulls&lt;/a&gt;, but please do remember that, while our subs overlap in many ways, we still have different objectives.   Many people participate in that sub because they are tired of worrying about their own dogs getting mauled.   Please feel free to go join the conversation over there, but remember that it is not &lt;a href=""/r/dogfree""&gt;r/dogfree&lt;/a&gt; and that the topic of discussion is pit bulls.  Come back here to our own sub to talk about your distaste for dogs in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I saw some Facebook groups and YouTube channels about disliking dogs.  Is that you guys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, the only groups run by this sub are &lt;a href=""/r/dogfree""&gt;r/dogfree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/r/dogfreehumor""&gt;r/dogfreehumor&lt;/a&gt;.  We don&amp;#39;t operate or endorse any YouTube channels, Facebook groups, or anything else on any other social media platform.  Our subscribers may link to their content here as long as it follows sub rules, but we are unaffiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I saw a post I don’t like.  What should I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Report it! On any post or comment, there is a “report” button. It will prompt you for further information as to why you are reporting the content to the moderators, who will then review it and determine whether or not it should be stay or be removed. Reports are anonymous and very helpful, as we can&amp;#39;t see everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone alluded to a conversation in another subreddit about dogs, and I really want to go down vote everything. Should I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, please don’t. This is called “brigading” or “vote manipulation,” and it is against Reddit’s Terms of Service. We actively discourage this behavior, as if we are found to be the source of a brigade against another sub, it could land us in big trouble. If you stumbled across a reference to another conversation on Reddit, the appropriate place to discuss that would be here, in our sub, in the thread in which you found it. Remember how it felt when a YouTuber made a video that resulted in a massive brigade against us; we must grant others the same respect for their space as we wish for ours, no matter how vehemently we disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sub is committed to abiding by all &lt;a href=""https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement""&gt;Reddit Terms of Service.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to crosspost something from another part of Reddit. May I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually no. If you crosspost something, it will go to a queue for moderator review. What we are looking for is whether or not the crosspost will incite drama between our sub and another. If we think the temptation for our sub to locate the post and participate would be too strong, we’ll decline it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My post mysteriously disappeared, and I don’t feel like I broke any rules. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot account for every contingency in the sub rules, so moderators do reserve the right to remove content at their discretion. That said, the moderation team is very much against arbitrary censorship and is committed to letting the conversation happen whenever possible. “I don’t like it” is not a good reason to remove a post or a comment; however, “it would be in the best interest of the community” is. The team is committed to being firm but fair in community moderation and will make all decisions in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Keep your dogs away from visitors at first guys because you dont know how people who come over for the first time feel about dogs. Even though dog nutters refuse to believe this, people who do not like dogs exist in the world.  


Most importantly, how dogs can be triggered by particular strangers near their territory is usually not anticipated until it happens for first time. 


As a personal anecdote: I fostered an awesome dog once upon a time. He was polite to strangers, quiet, knew commands, house broken, and overall a pretty chill dog. Besides the unavoidable dog smell and shedding he was the perfect dog - behavior wise. Until he saw a black person. Wtf. Out of nowhere the dog would turn aggressive and it was so embarrassing to me to walk him barking and pulling on the leash. Don’t ask me why he did that, it was the fucking weirdest thing I’ve ever seen a dog do (and I fostered many). Not gonna try to justify dog behavior by potential past experiences, they’re animals and they can be triggered by random things, even when abuse or provocation are not part of the equation. Some do not process fear or new experiences well and their behavior is mostly based on perceived threats vs. rewards 100% of the time. Not everything a dog does is a response to trauma or provocation. Why can’t most dog owners admit this is an intrinsic quality in dogs? I have no idea where the dog came from before ending up at the shelter but he had that issue and I had no idea until it almost dragged me face down on the sidewalk to attack someone. 


ANYWAY. Bottom line is: your dog is not a helpless teddy bear panda even though it french kisses you on the mouth everyday. Don’t act like you know the dog enough to predict their decision making process when it comes to strangers. Be polite and keep a safe distance.

I am in my 30s and have been terrified of dogs as long as I can remember. My family, on the other hand, loves them so I did grow up around them (mostly small ones). For as long as I can remember I have done things to avoid dogs. It's just become a part of my daily life. I don't go for walks. I only go to parks with my dog-loving husband but I mostly don't go at all. I am cautious walking to my car or to check the mail (if I am brave enough to do it). I don't let my kids play out back because the fence is broken but in all honesty if I hear a dog bark I don't let them go outside at all, fence or no. If I am going someplace new I have to know if there are dogs before I can go. Etc. To be frank I'm sick of it. I want to be able to go outside. I truly thought when I was younger that as I got older I'd get better but it's just getting worse. I've gotten better about my reaction to seeing dogs unexpectedly. I don't cry and I don't run and I can play it off somewhat; but I still shake, sweat, and inwardly freak out and need to leave. It also isn't helping that dog culture has people bringing their dogs everywhere. Two of them got into a fight in a grocery store a few months ago. When I was taking my kid to buy clothes last year someone brought a huge dog in the changing room area and the employees just fell all over themselves loving on it. Meanwhile I thought I was going to pass out. 

So with all this happening these days I feel even more scared and anxious. Any tips on not? I've been reading through the sub a bit and saw some mention mace and knives.

BTW: not required to have a dog, just need to love dogs. Might be able to sort of have a dog if you can't have one for some reason.

There's previously been zero problem with this until lately. 


Several weeks ago my husband told me that there's a new dog that absolutely loses its mind when it sees any other dogs. The neighbor will hold it's snoot while it's growling, snarling, and lunging saying ""leave it"", as if that's going to do shit. But they kept bringing out their shitty aggressive dog without leash or muzzle. I finally encountered it myself, but at first I didn't realize it was *the* asshole dog; it's some ugly junkyard pit mix looking thing. My hubs dog approaches it immediately because he loves sniffing other dog butts, and of course the thing goes nuts and tries to bite him. The neighbor grabbed it's collar but had no intention of taking it inside so I took hubs dog and went back in. I sent an email to the landlord which they've completely ignored so far as the pit owners keep bringing the damn thing back out there. I encountered them a second time and asked that they wait until I'm done because their dog is aggressive and the dude just gave me some idiotic blank stare and didn't take his fucking dog in. Of course.


So today I go to take the trash out, walking through this courtyard to do so. A different neighbor with a back door facing the courtyard opens their door and out rushes their fucking dog, barking behind me. I had my back turned to them and didn't see it but I didn't feel too concerned until this fucking thing runs up and BITES ME IN THE FUCKING ASS. It wasn't even the pit mix, instead a smallish 40-50lbs or so doberman looking mix. Luckily I was wearing jeans so it didn't pierce the skin. It's owner comes up and apologizes profusely but she doesn't grab the dog, instead just letting it sniff around with it's hackles raised right next to me. I'm pretty afraid of aggressive dogs so I told her to PLEASE get her dog because I was terrified of moving and having the thing come after me again. 


I really wish we didn't have a dog as I would LOVE to move the fuck out of here and find a no-dogs-allowed place. Between all of the nonstop barking and aggressive bullshit, living here just isn't worth it. And fuck all of the dog nuts who circlejerk each other into oblivion about how loving and pure these beasts are.

They don’t have good quality of life and I would love to put them up for adoption because it’s a big strain on our marriage and 3 large stinky senior dogs are just not enjoyable. They weren’t enjoyable when they were younger either. The German Shepherd has bitten and scarred me numerous times because he’s SO attached to my husband. I’ve lost feeling in two fingers because of the dog. They whine when they don’t get attention, they fart all the time and I lose my appetite.

This would be unacceptable by any society's standards. But somehow, it's okay for people to let their dogs do this because... they're dogs. Yeah... how about NO. I am sick and tired of these degenerate dog owners allowing their filthy mutts to behave like this in public. If dogs want to be around human dwellings, then they should adapt like every other animal has done so in order to benefit from being around human dwellings.

I have a dog, 12lbs pomapoo, who wasnt properly trained, socialized, etc...

If he doesnt acclimate, he stays outside or in my bedroom. When he shits on a neighbor or public yard during a walk, I always pick it up. Basically, Id like to think Im one of the okay owners.

But this sub is helping me see areas I can improve in my pet ownership and I agree with some opinions here too. I dont fully understand the strong hate (edited because I realized vitriol could've been taken as an insult or judgement and I didnt mean it that way), but I do understand the frustration and annoyance...if that makes sense lol

Took her for a walk, she kept on switching sides so you have to keep repositioning the lead, she can't just walk straight like a normal fucking dog, then she gets the lead caught under her leg so you have to lean down and adjust her fucking leg because she's too much a spacey retard to do it herself and will suffer through it until she finally gets the idea.

Not to mention her trying to take a shit in places that are wide and open for everyone to see but will ignore the more secluded areas.

&lt;p&gt;Took her for a walk, she kept on switching sides so you have to keep repositioning the lead, she can&amp;#39;t just walk straight like a normal fucking dog, then she gets the lead caught under her leg so you have to lean down and adjust her fucking leg because she&amp;#39;s too much a spacey retard to do it herself and will suffer through it until she finally gets the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention her trying to take a shit in places that are wide and open for everyone to see but will ignore the more secluded areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she is dead to the fucking world in her bed after acting like a petulant neurotic hairy fucking toddler and I&amp;#39;m mentally burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;

Inside this truck stop are two fast food establishments side to side with a small row of tables across from them. You have to pass by the restaurants to get to the restrooms. So, I decide I want a salad from Subway so I hop out of my truck to go inside. First stop was the ladies room and as I'm heading in that direction I see not one but two people with their dogs in line for food. 

One of them looked very uncomfortable being around so many people rushing around and that's the one I had to pass on the way to the ladies room. I'm not afraid of dogs but that one made me nervous. The second was this family with a very large shepard type dog. The dog wasn't doing anything bad but he almost pulled the wife over a couple of times and the husband would walk this beast around between his legs. Honestly, I'm not sure what kind of dog controlling move this was to be honest. 

I felt bad for anybody trying to eat in there and I don't understand why this is allowed. Of course there was the dog loving employee not doing anything about it.

If you're traveling with your dogs or any other pets in the summer get a spare key for your door. You can call around and find someone to make one for just your door so you don't have to pay $150 for one with a chip. That way, you can leave the AC on for your pet and lock them inside. I did this with my cats and all was well.

Why is this a thing? I don't understand why people don't plan trips and why they have to bring their dogs everywhere?

... and by the title I mean ban dogs from entering the store if they DON'T have a grooming or dog training appointment. Too many liabilities.

I work at a very poorly managed known pet store whos manager does nothing as far as safety is concerned or ill behaving pets. I often have to deal with animals with 'mild' zoonotic diseases without proper gear.

This is the place where groomers are forced to deal with unruly dogs just to get the store money and where people are dragged around by large gsd's- it's pathetic to watch. I see many morbidly obese dogs and ill behaved ones.  I watched a pitbull charge into a crowd of people aggressively at another dog and as the manager did nothing but stand there. And when I asked them if I could tell the owner to leave as he was posing a danger and the dog was behaving poorly before the incident, I was told not to. Okay, cool way foster a dangerous environment. So many unfixed, head strong and/or aggressive dogs walk through the doors everyday and nobody does anything about it.

I can't stand the constant barking and howling from the mutts with separation anxiety getting groomed. Yesterday I had to basically hold this womans dog at the register because she couldn't be bothered to take her lab with her to get something in the back of the store. Thanks for making your dog my responsibility as you speed off. Hell, the dog just sat there and looked at me with such a deadpanned look like ""sorry you have to deal with my idiot owner"". 

It's been under a year at this store and this is what i'm going to be dealing with on the regular I see. I am looking for other opportunities in my field and it's very hard to get even retail jobs here, so this is just a temporary gig.  I'm already stressed with the dog nutters, from nutters who don't clean up after their dogs (which means us employees must do it) to watching people ignore their mutts bad behaviour or thinking it's cute.

We have well paying jobs and I had time so I thought it’d be a good hearted thing to do. Dog is actually a great 3 yr old dog - no chewing, smart, potty trained, gorgeous (puppy mill dog unfortunately) but anxious like all rescues are. Long story short I have never received so much pressure from dognutters at the rescue group and dog nutters from my friend circle to keep her. My husband caved because he grew up with a dognutter mom too. I’m a softy and agreed. Now we are faced with the logistical nightmare of moving a medium Shepard dog that’s anxious cross country into one of the most expensive housing market in the world (Palo Alto area) and nothing seems to allow for dogs. Our ceiling for rent keeps going higher, and we’ve sunk so much time and money into considering how to move. (We also have a cat who I now appreciate 10x, and it’s better for her to fly bc it’s much shorter and less traumatic - so we are actually moving separately.) We continue to sink money into her training for anxiety so she can be a good neighbor and not bark if she hears a stranger approaching, and vet bills for all her shots that she didn’t get this year while her owner was in crisis.

I can’t believe I’m in this situation and buckled to all these nuts. In some ways it ruined my relationship with the dog because I feel like I’ve been pressured into keeping her by all these nuts instead of being accepted for doing a good thing by providing her a clean, safe, home for a few weeks while waiting for her permanent home. Now I’m moving across the country with her and about to start a new high stress job.

The rant isn’t about her and I accept full responsibility for my weakness. But this culture of rescue and assuming that you just need to add a little love to make ownership possible. Or that if you love animals that you should be committed to spending thousands of dollars and hours on them. Every day I’m walking the dog and I see horribly I’ll prepared owners and their anxious ratty rescue dogs barking at everyone and freaking muzzled because they aren’t safe.

My aunt’s emotional support dog was laying on the living room floor. I was unattended and like all kids, wanted to pet the doggy so I did. Well, this dog snapped at me as I went to give her a big hug and bit my cheek. I was terrified and hid under the table while the dog snarled at me, until my mom came in the room and noticed blood pouring down my face. I remember her shaking me in front of the bathroom mirror and demanding to know what had happened, but I was terrified of getting in trouble for bothering the dog so I lied and told her I didn’t know. 

At some point I’m sure my aunt and uncle figured this dog wasn’t fond of me, because she would sprawl in the kitchen entrance and lay there like she was guarding it, and I would freak out having to step over her. Sometimes she would snap and growl at me while I was stepping into the next room and I would just be told to “not be afraid”. It got to a point where I refused to walk over her unless my uncle went in front of me. 

One night around the same period of time, my mom and I were watching this dog alone and she became very aggressive. I remember my mom and I being huddled in one of my aunt’s bedrooms as this dog bared its teeth at us. My mom compared it to Cujo, this dog hated us so bad. Luckily we got her to leave the room and locked ourselves in until my aunt came home. 

Ever since then, I’ve gotten increasingly uneasy near dogs, especially bigger ones like the one my aunt had. I don’t remember the exact breed but I remember her resembling a german shepard mix of some sort. 

Honestly I hate how aggressive dogs can be and I hate how they can so easily get away with harming children. When I visit animal shelters (mostly for the cats but I always end up being dragged to the dog section)  the big dogs lunge at me in their cages and have this look in their eyes like I’m a piece of meat.

&lt;p&gt;At some point I’m sure my aunt and uncle figured this dog wasn’t fond of me, because she would sprawl in the kitchen entrance and lay there like she was guarding it, and I would freak out having to step over her. Sometimes she would snap and growl at me while I was stepping into the next room and I would just be told to “not be afraid”. It got to a point where I refused to walk over her unless my uncle went in front of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night around the same period of time, my mom and I were watching this dog alone and she became very aggressive. I remember my mom and I being huddled in one of my aunt’s bedrooms as this dog bared its teeth at us. My mom compared it to Cujo, this dog hated us so bad. Luckily we got her to leave the room and locked ourselves in until my aunt came home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, I’ve gotten increasingly uneasy near dogs, especially bigger ones like the one my aunt had. I don’t remember the exact breed but I remember her resembling a german shepard mix of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I hate how aggressive dogs can be and I hate how they can so easily get away with harming children. When I visit animal shelters (mostly for the cats but I always end up being dragged to the dog section)  the big dogs lunge at me in their cages and have this look in their eyes like I’m a piece of meat. I’m very unnerved by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teenager holding the lead is stuck outside with Mr Woofles while the rest of the family go in to order.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad they kept the dog outside but it got me thinking about the entitlement of thinking that you can bring your dog to a brand new establishment that has just been built.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy that this shop has that signage in place. Looks like I&amp;#39;ll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, I went back and someone was carrying a small brownish dog while in the checkout line. The dog was not on a leash (it seems like people think that as long as the dog's feet don't touch the floor, the law does not apply.) The clerk made eye contact with them several times and did nothing. They checked out, nothing said. The clerk acknowledged the dog and said it should be named ""Gizmo"" like that movie.

I waited and drank my Pepsi (lunch of champions) at the fountain until the dog was gone, and got a bit more for the inconvenience (hey, it was half ice anyway.)

I wasn't going to fight with the clerk since I see him most days, he was solo, no manager in the store, and there was a line.

I did report it to County Health, so if it is anything like the grocery store, it will force a re-inspection that will cost them $240 and cause a surprise inspection their own policies and following the law.

What sucks is that if it works, the dog people will leave them outside by the door, which is just as bad.

I like them; to a degree. I just wouldn’t own one, by choice, as they set off a lot of my sensory issues (I’ve got ASD) if I’m around them for long periods of time. I do, however, hate Those dog owners, my mother falling under this category at times. 

We have two dogs. One is fifteen, so obviously very old and fragile. Ignoring the fact she’s deaf and going blind (so it is pretty frustrating dealing with her sometimes) she’s okay for the most part. Our other dog is becoming an issue, though. 

He’s a French Mastiff, and huge. 76 kg. He’s around four years old. Now, this dog has always been “mouthy”. He’ll bark at you for anything. That’s gotten worse over time, and it is at a point I can’t even stand up without setting this dog off. He’ll jump up and bark, and even go for your hands sometimes. He’s “playing”. He’s essentially an overgrown puppy. 

Now, this isn’t even the main issue here. But having this overgrown puppy is becoming problematic. It’s one thing for a 5 kg dog to run around in our cramped house, chasing their tail n’ doing dumb dog shit. It’s another thing to have a 76 kg dog doing it. His puppy-ness also has resulted in his poor behaviour. We didn’t get him as a puppy, we actually fostered him before we adopted him (which is a whole other set of annoyances). This isn’t anything on my mother’s ability to train a dog. We’ve never, Ever had a poorly behaved dog outside of this one. Hell, years ago we had a bigger dog (87kg) who was Extremely well behaved. But because this dog has this stupid mindset, is extremely mouthy, and is essentially a huge male dog, it’s proved to be impossible. Now, this doesn’t mean he’s rude on the lead. In fact, the only time he is well behaved is when he’s on the lead. 

No. The problem is this aggression. He’s always been extremely aggressive surrounding food. But recently his mouthiness has become aggressive. Him going for my hands is becoming more frequent, and getting Much closer. He was extremely aggressive to my older dog the other day. My mother won’t listen to me. She claims she thinks there is something wrong, as it “isn’t in his nature”. She doesn’t understand I’m becoming increasingly concerned for my, her and my older dogs welfare. At the end of the day, I would choose the old dog over him. I’m seventeen. I grew up with this other dog; I’m extremely biased, yes, but she is also much better behaved, and is pretty healthy and happy aside the obvious ageing of her body. I wouldn’t want another dog after her, mind. I’m honestly done with them in the house. Thing is, any time he gets mouthy it’s “my fault”. As I said, I have ASD. But it sets him off. For example, when I’m happy I have a habit of flapping my hands. Yes, it’s childish, but it’s not even a conscious thing anymore. He could be asleep, he could be on the other side of the room, but the minute my hands so much as flap once, he’ll run over. I can’t raise my voice, which okay I shouldn’t be shouting, but I have poor volume awareness sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes. That sets him off. Laughing, coughing, sneezing, standing, sitting, it all sets him off. It’s always My Fault. Never the dogs fault. I mention this because I think it does paint a picture of who I’m dealing with; the dog can do no wrong. It’s reminiscent to pitbull owners who have “safe” dogs, so long you don’t do certain behaviours, wear certain things and hold/be in the vicinity of certain things. He also Hates new things. So if you’re wearing a hat, it’ll set him off. We recently got new neighbours, and he always barks at them, and barks at their dog, who is well behaved and never barks back. She ignores him (I don’t bloody blame her). She’s not barked once. It’s a pain in the ass. 

So, the advice. I’m sorry, it has been a long post. So firstly, if you read this far, thank you! I need to know how to explain to my mother that just because aggression “isn’t in his nature”, it is. At the end of the day, they’re still animals. They’re unpredictable. And we didn’t have him from a puppy. He’s been aggressive before, it’s getting more frequent. I need to know how to explain that, she either needs to take him to a vet, or take him elsewhere. This behaviour is escalating, and I don’t want to put myself, or my other dog at risk. She’s old. She doesn’t need this bullshit. My brother is also an unmentioned factor; he doesn’t like the dog and the dog doesn’t like him. I wouldn’t put it pass him to attack him if he gets out and is in one of his moods. Also, is it likely he will actually attack? He gets nasty without warning now, he went for my hand without even growling earlier because I told him to get out the kitchen and I pointed out. He went for the one not raised though. He’s no pitbull, but surely there’s still risk of him attacking? 

Thank you, and I’m really sorry. I’m honestly grateful for any advice; I can’t post to dog-friendly subreddits because I’m sure I’ll have the same bullshit my mother gives me. But I’m also scared posting here, because I don’t necessarily hate dogs, just find them too much (I mean. Okay yeah there are some I hate but okay).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will preface this by saying I don’t hate dogs. I like them; to a degree.

&lt;p&gt;He’s a French Mastiff, and huge. 76 kg. He’s around four years old. Now, this dog has always been “mouthy”. He’ll bark at you for anything. That’s gotten worse over time, and it is at a point I can’t even stand up without setting this dog off. He’ll jump up and bark, and even go for your hands sometimes. He’s “playing”. He’s essentially an overgrown puppy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this isn’t even the main issue here. But having this overgrown puppy is becoming problematic. It’s one thing for a 5 kg dog to run around in our cramped house, chasing their tail n’ doing dumb dog shit. It’s another thing to have a 76 kg dog doing it. His puppy-ness also has resulted in his poor behaviour. We didn’t get him as a puppy, we actually fostered him before we adopted him (which is a whole other set of annoyances). This isn’t anything on my mother’s ability to train a dog. We’ve never, Ever had a poorly behaved dog outside of this one. Hell, years ago we had a bigger dog (87kg) who was Extremely well behaved. But because this dog has this stupid mindset, is extremely mouthy, and is essentially a huge male dog, it’s proved to be impossible. Now, this doesn’t mean he’s rude on the lead. In fact, the only time he is well behaved is when he’s on the lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. The problem is this aggression. He’s always been extremely aggressive surrounding food. But recently his mouthiness has become aggressive. Him going for my hands is becoming more frequent, and getting Much closer. He was extremely aggressive to my older dog the other day. My mother won’t listen to me. She claims she thinks there is something wrong, as it “isn’t in his nature”. She doesn’t understand I’m becoming increasingly concerned for my, her and my older dogs welfare. At the end of the day, I would choose the old dog over him. I’m seventeen. I grew up with this other dog; I’m extremely biased, yes, but she is also much better behaved, and is pretty healthy and happy aside the obvious ageing of her body. I wouldn’t want another dog after her, mind. I’m honestly done with them in the house. Thing is, any time he gets mouthy it’s “my fault”. As I said, I have ASD. But it sets him off. For example, when I’m happy I have a habit of flapping my hands. Yes, it’s childish, but it’s not even a conscious thing anymore. He could be asleep, he could be on the other side of the room, but the minute my hands so much as flap once, he’ll run over. I can’t raise my voice, which okay I shouldn’t be shouting, but I have poor volume awareness sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes. That sets him off. Laughing, coughing, sneezing, standing, sitting, it all sets him off. It’s always My Fault. Never the dogs fault. I mention this because I think it does paint a picture of who I’m dealing with; the dog can do no wrong. It’s reminiscent to pitbull owners who have “safe” dogs, so long you don’t do certain behaviours, wear certain things and hold/be in the vicinity of certain things. He also Hates new things. So if you’re wearing a hat, it’ll set him off. We recently got new neighbours, and he always barks at them, and barks at their dog, who is well behaved and never barks back. She ignores him (I don’t bloody blame her). She’s not barked once. It’s a pain in the ass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the advice. I’m sorry, it has been a long post. So firstly, if you read this far, thank you! I need to know how to explain to my mother that just because aggression “isn’t in his nature”, it is. At the end of the day, they’re still animals. They’re unpredictable. And we didn’t have him from a puppy. He’s been aggressive before, it’s getting more frequent. I need to know how to explain that, she either needs to take him to a vet, or take him elsewhere. This behaviour is escalating, and I don’t want to put myself, or my other dog at risk. She’s old. She doesn’t need this bullshit. My brother is also an unmentioned factor; he doesn’t like the dog and the dog doesn’t like him. I wouldn’t put it pass him to attack him if he gets out and is in one of his moods. Also, is it likely he will actually attack? He gets nasty without warning now, he went for my hand without even growling earlier because I told him to get out the kitchen and I pointed out. He went for the one not raised though. He’s no pitbull, but surely there’s still risk of him attacking? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, and I’m really sorry. I’m honestly grateful for any advice; I can’t post to dog-friendly subreddits because I’m sure I’ll have the same bullshit my mother gives me. But I’m also scared posting here, because I don’t necessarily hate dogs, just find them too much (I mean. Okay yeah there are some I hate but okay).&lt;/p&gt;

I never really liked dogs.  We didn’t have one when I was growing up.  But, I didn’t care that some people owned dogs.  My grandmother had a dog.  It just growled at us when we visited.  Anyway, there was a bar I used to frequent near my house about 10 years ago.  I was a regular there.  One day, I started noticing some people with dogs in there.  At first, I thought it was strange, but I minded my own business.  Then, I started noticing this trend at a few other bars in the area.  I was in a different bar where a guy had his small dog up on the bar.  I thought that was unsanitary and I left.  Then, a few weeks later, back at the regular bar I would go to, some guy’s dog came right at me.  It jumped on my leg and bit me.  For no reason at all, this dog attacked me.  Luckily, it was a small dog and I had jeans on.  It didn’t puncture my skin, but it left a bruise on my thigh.  I yelled at the guy asking him why the dog was in the bar.  He gave me some incoherent answer and walked away.  He didn’t apologize.  A few minutes later, I see the guy back in the bar with his dog like nothing happened.  It was that incident that changed my view of dogs and dog ownership.  What right do dog owners have bringing these animals into public places where they can hurt someone?  Why is there so little regulation of this?  It became apparent to me that dog owners were exploiting the ADA for purposes of bringing their dogs into public places and that business owners couldn’t discern which dogs were service dogs and which ones weren’t.  So, they just let all dogs in.  It’s my feeling that dogs in public places are an infringement on the rights of those of us that want nothing to do with them.  It’s not right and something needs to change.  Dogs are a public health risk.  It doesn’t make sense that the federal government granted special rights to dog owners to subject the public to these animals.

Since that incident, I’ve had several negative encounters with dog owners in public places.  I was in the checkout line at Harbor Freight Tool about 5 years ago.  This woman had a dog that was pestering me and I asked her to please take her dog away from me.  Instead of respecting my wishes, she shot back at me.  What right do these dog owners have to bother strangers in stores with their dogs?  I don’t get it.  It’s like there's a loss of civility in our society and this all seems to stem from changes to the ADA that were made in 2012.  The new ADA rules have handicapped business owners from regulating dogs in their establishments.  Their response has been to allow dogs in and let the public deal with it.

Since these incidents happened, I've been reading about children who've been killed by dogs.  Why do we allow this?  If a child is killed by a dog, then someone needs to go to jail.  In fact, every time a child is bitten by a dog, someone needs to face charges.  It's not enough to just take the dog away.  This is a federal issue, not a local issue.  It's time for the US federal government to protect the public from dogs.

At first, I thought it was strange, but I minded my own business.  Then, I started noticing this trend at a few other bars in the area.  I was in a different bar where a guy had his small dog up on the bar.  I thought that was unsanitary and I left.  Then, a few weeks later, back at the regular bar I would go to, some guy’s dog came right at me.  It jumped on my leg and bit me.  For no reason at all, this dog attacked me.  Luckily, it was a small dog and I had jeans on.  It didn’t puncture my skin, but it left a bruise on my thigh.  I yelled at the guy asking him why the dog was in the bar.  He gave me some incoherent answer and walked away.  He didn’t apologize.  A few minutes later, I see the guy back in the bar with his dog like nothing happened.  It was that incident that changed my view of dogs and dog ownership.  What right do dog owners have bringing these animals into public places where they can hurt someone?  Why is there so little regulation of this?  It became apparent to me that dog owners were exploiting the ADA for purposes of bringing their dogs into public places and that business owners couldn’t discern which dogs were service dogs and which ones weren’t.  So, they just let all dogs in.  It’s my feeling that dogs in public places are an infringement on the rights of those of us that want nothing to do with them.  It’s not right and something needs to change.  Dogs are a public health risk.  It doesn’t make sense that the federal government granted special rights to dog owners to subject the public to these animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that incident, I’ve had several negative encounters with dog owners in public places.  I was in the checkout line at Harbor Freight Tool about 5 years ago.  This woman had a dog that was pestering me and I asked her to please take her dog away from me.  Instead of respecting my wishes, she shot back at me.  What right do these dog owners have to bother strangers in stores with their dogs?  I don’t get it.  It’s like there&amp;#39;s a loss of civility in our society and this all seems to stem from changes to the ADA that were made in 2012.  The new ADA rules have handicapped business owners from regulating dogs in their establishments.  Their response has been to allow dogs in and let the public deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these incidents happened, I&amp;#39;ve been reading about children who&amp;#39;ve been killed by dogs.  Why do we allow this?  If a child is killed by a dog, then someone needs to go to jail.  In fact, every time a child is bitten by a dog, someone needs to face charges.  It&amp;#39;s not enough to just take the dog away.  This is a federal issue, not a local issue.  It&amp;#39;s time for the US federal government to protect the public from dogs.  Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

I live with a dog right now that I don't bother with much - she's far more attached to two other household members anyways. We just sorta accept each other. But she's got separation issues, and everyday whenever her favorite person leaves, she whines and barks, then eventually gives up.

Of course, whenever they return, she goes right back to losing her mind. Wagging and running and barking so loudly my ears ring, crashing into things and such. They find it cute (of course), and I get scolded if I tell the dog to hush with her barking.

Does anyone else feel the same way?

We just started up again after a stop sign and were going maybe about 18-20mph. Suddenly, this dog jumps right in front of us. We swerved and luckily did not hit the dog or the parked cars up and down the street on both sides, and luckily we were not rear ended. 

I started shouting at the woman because we almost had an accident because of her irresponsibility (windows rolled up so I’m sure she saw my face but it could have been worse). She started making that “what’s wrong with you” gesture at us. I rolled down the window and told her that it’s illegal in Chicago to have your dog off leash and I told her that if she cares about her dog and its safety she would keep it on leash.

We just started up again after a stop sign and were going maybe about 18-20mph. Suddenly, this dog jumps right in front of us. We swerved and luckily did not hit the dog or the parked cars up and down the street on both sides, and luckily we were not rear ended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started shouting at the woman because we almost had an accident because of her irresponsibility (windows rolled up so I’m sure she saw my face but it could have been worse). She started making that “what’s wrong with you” gesture at us. I rolled down the window and told her that it’s illegal in Chicago to have your dog off leash and I told her that if she cares about her dog and its safety she would keep it on leash.

I knew that I'd be in for this and it's not my place so I knew I'd just have to deal with it. 

When we arrived, no shit, the first words out of the owners mouths are ""oh Sammi stinks so bad"", and proceed to talk about how awful the dog reeks and how they've tried everything. Now I dont know if they're joking but the shit they said they tried is borderline abuse. Lysol and such, like that's gonna help the fucking thing, sure, chemical burn it's skin, that'll definitely improve it's condition. I finally catch a whiff of it and holy fucking hell it smells like vomit on shit. And it's not on it's already putrid breath, it's in it's fur. 

This was the center of conversation for like a fucking hour. They talked about how it gets better if you just put her in the lake. Eventually the other couples arrived and for every couple there was one additional begging, stinking mutt. We go and sit by the lake and the chosen activity is to dote on the fucking dogs. The little one immediately rolls in frog guts and smells like a baked outhouse. Those owners at least had the kindness to immediately catch and wash him off in the lake which made it slightly better. 

The other incurably stinky one likes to retrieve rocks... not balls, only rocks, and they spent the next 3 hours throwing rocks into the lake for this stupid dog to break it's teeth on. The other two dogs halfheartedly wade into the lake following the idiot rock retriever. Every time, all three dogs come back out and shake on everyone sitting in chairs enjoying a beer with a nice view. 

I am known for not being a dog lover but I'm still getting shit for trying to use a hat or anything else to not get shaken on and yet they all still lightly protest every time the dogs shake their frog gut/puke shit smelling water on them. I finally couldn't take it anymore (my fucking beer can actually smelled like shit from the shaken water, I couldn't believe it) and I proceeded to stand up and shift around every 2 minutes for each new stupid fucking rock pulled back out of the lake.

We didn't take the boat out because the rock retrieval and the smelly sprinkler were deemed a fun enough activity for the day. Now I'm not mad about the boat part, it's not my place, I can't dictate what the group is going to do, but it's just fucking insane to spend a weekend discussing how bad the dog smells, get more dogs, then make the central activity focus around spreading that scent around as much as possible. I actually really like my girlfriend's family too, that's the worst part. They're fun friendly people who are legitimately charismatic and like me as well. But instead of getting to know each other better or doing something actually fun, we catered to the fucking dogs the entire day. Now here we are the next day and everyone is lamenting that we didn't take the boat out yesterday because it's raining all day today. Fucking madness. A beautiful place and beautiful weather wasted/ruined, all for a nice ""sweet whoooozagoodboy doggo pupper sweetiepoo stinkybuns"" vacation. Fuuuuuuck dogs.

Edit: some manner of sanity has prevailed and someone bought some skunk shampoo to try and fix this bullshit. So at least I get to watch dog nutters get knocked over by their spazz dog getting washed.

My family likes to hire her to watch their dogs and house sit while they’re away. Normally it has just been for my uncle’s house, where he has a little rat-looking dog that, while obnoxious, doesn’t get into much trouble or is too difficult to look after. My other aunt and uncle asked my sister to look after their house and their dog while they’re away for the fourth (they’re still gone). 

This dog of theirs is a big, absolutely batshit moronic sheep-dog looking thing. I’m talking negative IQ, zero self awareness, and a complete lack of consideration for its surroundings. My sister invited me to spend the night at the house with her, and in that comparatively small sliver of time that dog proved to be like the world’s most annoying nuisance. Not only was its fur oily and gross to touch, it invaded my space with its slobber and awful breath constantly and persistently, absolutely hellbent on licking my shins and feet - which is not only incredibly disgusting and a blatant broach of personal space, but its insistence upon continuing to do it even after being told NO and being turned away/put outside was incredibly frustrating. My friend ended up saying “fuck it” and just let the dog sit there on the couch (where it isn’t allowed to be, and I’m sure the dog knew it) and lick their legs because they literally couldn’t get this fucking dog away from them. 

After a night of annoying squeal-barking for virtually no justifiable reason, my sister awoke to the dog viscerally ripping apart her overnight mouth nightguard. This dog had somehow nosed its way into a closed compartment of her backpack, sniffed out the expensive medicinal-grade mouth guard she needs to keep from grinding her teeth every night, and literally chewed it and its case to fucking pieces. Not only was it put into a safe place (a ZIPPERED UP slot on her backpack), but its uninsured, very very expensive, and requires a whole ass orthodontic session to mold a new one. My sister is not prone to crying often but she was in fucking tears. 

Knowing how stupid the damn dog is, it probably ingested some plastic shards and fucked up its gut. While I hope that isn’t the case, that’s a costly trip to the vet for my aunt and uncle. I sort of don’t mind the fact that the dog will eventually have to shit out painful shreds of plastic. 

The worst part is that this dog (and probably all dogs in general) is too brain dead stupid to understand right and wrong and to comprehend punishment, so there’s literally nothing we can do about it. The dog is just sitting there, thinking it’s the shining star of the room, while the rest of us have found a new flavor of contempt for the dirty creature. 

Not once during our entire afternoon and overnight stay did that dog provide anyone with a modicum of happiness or enjoyment - the thing was just a high-maintenance, incredibly frustrating, absolutely disgusting shit machine. What’s the fucking point of keeping such a destructive and stupid creature around??","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my sister wasn’t on the dogfree boat before today, she definitely is now. &lt;/p&gt;

*According to the police a woman and walking her 2 dogs lost control of her [Mastiff- breed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Mastiff) dog.*

A mastiff-breed dog attacked a 10 year old on a bicycle on a Tuesday afternoon in Hämeenlinna.

*In Oikolantie (a road), the boy came across a woman taking her 2 dogs on a walk, and the woman could not control her other dog. The dog bit the child, who got severe injuries in different parts of his body, that required treatment in a hospital.*

*The police is investigating this as a "" negligent and unintentional infliction of injury.""* (No idea what the crime is really called in english, but I think you get the idea)

Then there is some stuff about how sweet and popular the Mastiff breed is, but they surprisingly mention how the breed has a history of being used in dog fighting.

*The police sergeant Timo Ojala criticizes the owner's responsibility, also commenting about how you should think if a specific breed suits you:*

*-""Can you train and control such a dog? When we know what kind of breed has done this, then especially with a dog like that you should have things under control. Like a dog always should be. The owners should look at themselves if they can't keep it under control.*

The younger one has never been to school. She’s a complete moron who shits and pisses inside at least three times per day. Just last weekend I had to clean up her piss the second I got in the door, again two minutes later when I walked out of the bathroom and found fresh piss in the bedroom, pick up her slimy shit outside when I took her out, and clean up even more piss when she went again after we came in. I’ve been here half an hour already and have had to clean up shit and piss four times and haven’t even taken off my shoes yet. I don’t know about you, but I take my clothes off as soon as I get in the door at home.

I now view my home as more than just an apartment, it’s a dogfree sanctuary. I love it. My roommate has a cat I love more now as well. She doesn’t bark or have to be let out. When she sleeps with me, she picks a spot and sticks to it, plus she’s tiny. Not like my girlfriend’s older dog who has to take up half the bed and move around constantly. I will never have a full nights sleep here. The younger one wakes us up at 5 am to be let out. 

I also work overnights, so I sleep while she’s at work. Her dogs still want to bark and act like morons while I’m trying to sleep. I understand they probably want to be more active, but that’s their problem. It doesn’t need to become mine. I am pre-annoyed by them by the time I haven’t even left my own place to come over yet. I don’t look forward to seeing them at all. At least the older one went to dog school, so his behavior isn’t so bad. Still wakes me up too much though.

They’re loud. They won’t stop barking at everything. I can’t even watch a video on my phone without them freaking out. And they smell horrible. I had to get out of bed with them earlier because he literally smells like shit since she let him roll around outside. This is a huge apartment building with probably more than a hundred dogs living here. The courtyard is probably covered in shit. I’m honestly surprised the building is virtually silent considering how many dogs live here. 

I’ve stayed with her in spite of the fact that she has them. I’ve told her I hate dogs and I hate it when she refers to me as their daddy. She guilts me into taking care of them because I’m so willing to drive across town to feed my roommates cat, but I don’t wanna let the dogs out at 5 am on a Saturday. No shit I don’t want to get up that early, first of all. Second, the cat needs food to live. Third, I only do that once in awhile when my roommate seriously has to go to work early (barista at a breakfast/cafe place). And most importantly, why should I have to bear the burden of dealing with them if YOURE ALREADY HOME? That’s the difference! You’re home, the cat’s mom is at work! I’m her only chance of being fed! Of course I’ll go feed her. In addition, I actually care about the cat. I don’t give a fuck about these dogs. I’ve told her before that if she didn’t have dogs already when we met, I wouldn’t let her get any.

And if we move in together I probably won’t be able to adopt my own cat because most of these pet friendly buildings only allow two animals. 😟 She has agreed to pay for the younger one to go to school.......if I take her. As if it’s my responsibility. She needs to get her trained either way. She should have done it years ago. I don’t understand what makes it all worth it to her. She’s clearly annoyed by them! Isn’t she tired of cleaning up after her constantly? We got her a shock collar at least. If it doesn’t work then I’m telling her to buy a fucking muzzle, because I’ve had it with this shit. I pretty much completely ignore the dogs now. I just don’t acknowledge them when they get in my face and the only thing I say to them at this point is “SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!!!”

I don’t know if I can handle it. At least I have somewhat of a connection with the older one I guess. He’s a good dog and he’s prettt cute. But he still isn’t a cat. This is how I rank animals:

Cats
Humans

This same neighbor lit off fireworks all night on Tuesday night on MY SIDEWALK. The neighbor and I have very close yards and they did not want the mess in theirs (this is what I heard them tell the kids).

Since I couldn't sleep, I went for a walk. Since police do nothing, I didn't call. The neighbor came up and begged me and my child to ""please help find the tiny pomeranian"" because it had run away due to the noise.

It took all I had to not tell her to fuck right off. I would have told her to do so if my child weren't with me. Her other dog (a pointer) has shit in my yard in the past and been hit by multiple cars while I run around trying to catch it.

This morning, I woke up to a long Facebook post, with ""adorable"" photos about how the dog was hit by a car and it wasn't her fault. ""My baby never leaves my side"" was in the caption.

The dog lived after hundreds of dollars in vet bills.

Full opinion shortened: I don't mind *most* dogs, but FUCK this ESA shit. I cannot fucking stand my roommate's dog, her, or the piece of shit fuck buddy that practically lives with us. There's a lot to this story but I'll do my best to stay on topic since I should've known she'd be trouble the minute she said she had an ESA. It is a black terrier (terror) poodle looking thing. It has that gross curly fur that just always feels disgusting no matter what.


Let me start with the fact that I cannot keep my door open, and her room is the one with an AC unit. (r/crappydesign anyone?) Now, this normally wouldn't bother me because I'm a frigging reptile and like it at or around a nice toasty 75 in my room. For the past week though the heat has been in the high 90s for two weeks and I found out at the beginning of the summer that this bitch's dog can't be trusted for FIVE MINUTES in my room. I'm a college student. I have no fucking use for a baby gate nor am I going to buy one when I'm only going to have to put up with her for only one more month. This was the first problem I ran into back in May, and I chalked it up to being the dogs fault. I let him in my room while she wasn't there so he wasn't lonely, I walked into the kitchen for literally less than five minutes then found out he pissed on a single sock, and also one corner of my purple shag rug that I had to wash by hand 😡


My next issue, that was prominent right after the relative adjustment period for most pets in a new place, is that this dog is not trained in any way, shape, or form. AND he pisses for both attention and the fact my roommate isn't ever here to let him out and is too lazy to take care of him by herself. She doesn't complain about the fact I silently refuse to clean it up, since it's not my dog, but I can't stand that the bathroom always smells like piss and I have to dodge land mines in the hallway. He pisses well over three times a day in that hallway. 


The main point of this story: I never knew how bad of a problem the whole ESA thing would be. She has papers that state she can legally avoid the pet fees and other rules as such. This isn't fair to me or other dog/cat/anything else owners. She is literally using her diagnosis to her advantage. An ESA is NOT a service dog (and she's at least aware enough that she wouldn't take him into public as a service animal) But seriously. Fucking stick to your meds like the rest of us. She is nowhere near responsible enough to even keep the dog. It's at her discretion. He is literally a toy and his needs are being tended to at the BARE MINIMUM. That's not all to this story though ...  Let me tell you what she did when I got my HAMSTERS 🙃


She was two steps from throwing a damn fit, I swear. She was CONSTANTLY bugging me to talk to the apartment owners and check to see if I needed to put down a deposit. The double standard was almost unreal. I'm living here for THREE MONTHS. NOBODY CARES. MY HAMSTERS HAVE A CAGE AND DONT PISS EVERYWHERE. IF YOU CAN AVOID PET REPERCUSSIONS SO CAN I. Nobody. Cares. Most apartments don't see small caged animals or fish as a warrant for a fee anyways because they don't cause significant damage to the apartment. I told her that without actually checking with the apartment because I don't care. Are they really going to try to bust me for hamsters? Someone is just going to randomly check and say THESE NEED TO GO while stepping in my roomate's dog piss? Get off my ass, Lady. 


Off topic, as of a few days ago her live-in fuck buddy is now trying to go after my hamsters as if I'm not caring for them enough, WHILE I AM VISITING FAMILY, and I wouldn't hold it against his trashy as to try and steal them while I'm gone.  He should steal my roomate's dog too, since she cares for it less than I care for my hamsters.

When we walked into the cinema, there were two people (I did not get a good look at them) and a young child. The child (5 or so years old) was pulling a large realistic-plush dog on a leash into the cinema. At first I thought ""she seems kind of old to be doing this..."" and was a bit annoyed at her caretakers. For a split second I thought it might be real because it was being treated so intently like a real dog by everyone--the staff, the adults with her (who I didn't even make note of because I was so bewildered by the whole thing), and the child. 

I looked again it's legs were not moving and not respirating, but it was being gently pulled along. She was convincingly pulling it along carefully and calmly like it was a real dog. The ticket taker asked her ""What is your doggy's name?"" and so on. The exchange lasted 30-40 seconds tops, but it was so incredibly surreal.

A lot of thoughts were coming and going but as I remember it; I went from confused to annoyed. She is like *5 years old.* It seems strange for a older child to bring a plush toy around in general, but it happens, and not a real issue other than it being pulled on the ground which seemed dirty. I thought, ""*Maybe there is a reason... maybe she is mentally disabled and functionally impaired so it serves some purpose*, *I should not make presumptions. No.  I don't think so, she seems articulate, responsive, physically in control, she seems 'typical'""*.

I went back to being annoyed. 

What bothered me was my initial thought, ""*This kind of dependence doesn't seem very healthy... she is old enough that absent some major problem I'm not seeking... they really probably should not be encouraging or allowing this sort of thing. I would not allow my kid to do that. It isn't doing her any favors developmentally.*"" It did not even register that it was specifically dog... just that it was a plushie. I thought ""*They are not working to help this little girl mature to be able to go out in public without their toy... it is better than kids who play gameboy or with phones loudly in public... but this still seems like they are doing her a real disservice.""* 

Then the thought hit me ""*Well, I suppose it isn't any different than adults who bring their dogs everywhere.*"" Annoyance deepened. More than a disservice; they could be actively *conditioning this little girl to always have dogs and take them everywhere.* Annoyance turned to disgust.

 I thought to myself ""*would I be this annoyed if the toy was a stuffed octopus or a game character?*"" Honestly, probably less, though I did feel annoyed before I really pieced together what it was. At the same time, she was treating it so intently like a real dog. I *know* she is not thinking the ideal ""it is not OK to take pets places."" I know she is carrying around this animal, probably imitating adults or movies or whatever and growing up with this being a totally normal thing, worst-case she is thinking ""someday I can take a **real** dog places with me!""

Of course, I didn't say anything. It wasn't my place. I'd be annoyed if some random person felt entitled to question my parenting... no laws were being broken, nothing was unsafe, I wasn't harmed... live and let live.

Maybe (probably) she'll grow out of it on her own or her parent(s) will step in--but more than a kid dragging a plushie around on the pavement and on the sticky the cinema floor; she is probably learning that it is OK and even desirable to take pets everywhere. In 13 years she could be dragging her own dog around the cinema, maybe even feeling like she *cannot* do without it since it was *potentially* never matured out of her.

It was just *discouraging*.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been several years since I have been to the cinema, for no real reason beyond not being in the habit of doing so, but my wife got some free passes from work so we decided to go use them.&lt;/p&gt;

More than a disservice; they could be actively &lt;em&gt;conditioning this little girl to always have dogs and take them everywhere.&lt;/em&gt; Annoyance turned to disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;would I be this annoyed if the toy was a stuffed octopus or a game character?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Honestly, probably less, though I did feel annoyed before I really pieced together what it was. At the same time, she was treating it so intently like a real dog. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; she is not thinking the ideal &amp;quot;it is not OK to take pets places.&amp;quot; I know she is carrying around this animal, probably imitating adults or movies or whatever and growing up with this being a totally normal thing, worst-case she is thinking &amp;quot;someday I can take a &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; dog places with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn&amp;#39;t say anything. It wasn&amp;#39;t my place. I&amp;#39;d be annoyed if some random person felt entitled to question my parenting... no laws were being broken, nothing was unsafe, I wasn&amp;#39;t harmed... live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe (probably) she&amp;#39;ll grow out of it on her own or her parent(s) will step in--but more than a kid dragging a plushie around on the pavement and on the sticky the cinema floor; she is probably learning that it is OK and even desirable to take pets everywhere. In 13 years she could be dragging her own dog around the cinema, maybe even feeling like she &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; do without it since it was &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; never matured out of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just &lt;em&gt;discouraging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I stumbled across this page after realizing about a year ago that I absolutely cannot stand dogs, and am happy to say I found this page. I've been holding a lot in over the last year, lets just say... Anyways, this is just going to be a jumbled rant on my experiences with dogs and all I can't stand about them... Feel free to read if you want, I just really have to let this all out. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Day 1 of my first bad experiences: 8 years old at my Aunts, walking her crappy lab/pit/whatever mix on the side of the road, notice a car coming (didnt want the dog to get hit) pulled on its collar a bit, dog veers its head and bites me in the arm. Ended up getting infected. Aunt begged us no to go to the hospital because she didnt want to risk losing her ""baby""

\- My friends ALL have dogs and love the shit out of them to the point where it is borderline unhealthy. My friend has 6 dogs atm in a small house full of 7 people. They never let the dogs out so they constantly crap and go everywhere- their floors are ruined and permanently soaked from the dogs peeing so much.  And the smell... oh my gosh the smell... I'm pretty sure its worse than a shelter, I'm not even kidding. And of course, when you arrive at her house the dogs let out a million piercing barks and crowd around you at the door. I love her as a friend but man that house is violating a million different health codes.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Speaking of this friend, she's a big animal person, and dog-nutter. She had a french bulldog who was her baby, and she'd let this dog sleep with her, lick her face (heeelll naw) and everything else. She has lots of different animals, and the dog was a killing machine. Before it died, it killed two pet rabbits, a cat, and a hamster... Other dogs weren't much better. Another one of her hamsters was in a wheel, accidentally fell out, then was mauled by the dogs as a pack. But gueeesss what? Still loved the heck out of that dog till the day it died, never reacted much to the deaths of the other animals. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Fast forward, my family decides to get a puppy from a run-down pet store two hours away: a ""french bulldog mix."" This is when my hatred for dogs really started burning. This dog was a LIVING HELL. I can't describe to you what we had to go through with this dog- we had him for a month, that was all. Paid $800 dollars for it. This dog went up to my knees, and was constantly hyper, and ""played"" rough. While trying to play with the dog, my younger brother would get scratches and bites all of his arms and legs from this thing, and even when my brother was done playing and just laying on the couch this dog would lunge at him and not stop being so aggressive. My brother would scream and cry, and he still had the scars months after we got rid of that dog. The rest of us were scared of him too: this dog would lunge at anyone to try and ""play"" by biting and scratching. I was afraid to death of him, to be honest. I would never run outside when taking him out in fear that he would run after me and jump on top of me. Stupid dog also had accidents all over the house and ended up ruining our new couch. Because of this, the whole house was extremely stressful and always on the edge whenever possible. Dog also chewed up my laptop charger at one point (sucked because I was having such a good day) and ran into my room, knocking a humidifier over which got my $30 drawing paper wet. Never really rememberd what happened during the whole period we had that shitbeast because it was so stressful and terrible. Long story short, because of all of the stress my dad ended up punching a hole in my bedroom door in anger while in an argument with my mom over the dog (my parents are never violent at all, this just goes to show how far that dog pushed us all) and we ended up selling him to family whos mom puts bows is his fur now and calls him Marty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaaannnd flash to now, I'm still with my family and we have a little dog and puppy. The dog came first and was okay, I guess, but holy crap this puppy is so annoying. This dog literally shits and leaks all over the place, and It's just so disgusting.  I don't understand how anyone can handle that,  it just makes me realize what total slobs dogs are. And his BARK oh my gosh it literally makes my ears BLEED. I'm very sensitive to loud noises, so hearing my 9 y.o brother scream at the top of his lungs (ever heard a little kid scream? like, *really* scream? Screw that) to get the puppy to bark makes me want to crawl into a hole and never come out. Besides those stupid things, where did the whole loyal thing with dogs even come from?? Read a post somewhere here about dogs only wanting food, and holy crap I can't express to you how truthful that is. Yeah, sure dogs may be a ""loYAl MaNs BesSt fRienD"" when they hang around you because they want attention, but once they see anyone with food or hear the crinkle of a bag they forget everything about you and are off. I find it funny how some people think that their dogs are their guardian angels or something when I see our own dogs running off after food, lol. And holy crap \*PERSONAL SPACE\* ..... I cant stand it when I go over to someone's house and their slimly little beasts are shoving their disgusting noses all around in my space or trying to get a good smell at my butt. It makes me so mad having to deal with that! When you go over to a person's house for the first time and it's already a little awkward, I hate having a dog come up to me and trying jumping on me and whipping its body at me because it makes everything *soo much* more awkward having to pretend like you like that dog/ trying to shove it off of you. Blech, screw that. Like mentioned above, also hate the destruction of dogs: literally NOTHING can go untouched for them. Our puppy keeps gnawing on the feet of chairs and tables and I cant stand it. Luckily I haven't had any encounters so far with the dogs touching any of my stuff, but I honestly am scared of it happening. I keep my door shut at all times, but still couldn't imagine what they'd do if they got in.  I'm really into historical artifacts, etc, and also fashion so I have lot of irreplaceable items on display and I couldn't imagine anything happening to them... I'm sorry but fuck dogs man.

I find it funny how some people think that their dogs are their guardian angels or something when I see our own dogs running off after food, lol. And holy crap *PERSONAL SPACE* ..... I cant stand it when I go over to someone&amp;#39;s house and their slimly little beasts are shoving their disgusting noses all around in my space or trying to get a good smell at my butt. It makes me so mad having to deal with that! When you go over to a person&amp;#39;s house for the first time and it&amp;#39;s already a little awkward, I hate having a dog come up to me and trying jumping on me and whipping its body at me because it makes everything &lt;em&gt;soo much&lt;/em&gt; more awkward having to pretend like you like that dog/ trying to shove it off of you. Blech, screw that. Like mentioned above, also hate the destruction of dogs: literally NOTHING can go untouched for them. Our puppy keeps gnawing on the feet of chairs and tables and I cant stand it. Luckily I haven&amp;#39;t had any encounters so far with the dogs touching any of my stuff, but I honestly am scared of it happening. I keep my door shut at all times, but still couldn&amp;#39;t imagine what they&amp;#39;d do if they got in.  I&amp;#39;m really into historical artifacts, etc, and also fashion so I have lot of irreplaceable items on display and I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine anything happening to them... I&amp;#39;m sorry but fuck dogs man. &lt;/p&gt;

They don't know personal boundaries. They stink. Stepping in poop sucks. They're loud. Thought I'd share my current situation...

My husband and I went out of town for four days. My mother in law kept our kids for us, and while we were gone, a stray puppy wandered into her yard. After putting APBs out and hearing nothing back, she kept him around the house because my kids fell in love. We got home, went to get the kids, and came home with a dog I didn't want. MIL didn't want to keep him and I could.not.convince. starry-eyed husband otherwise (he's a sucker for human babies and baby animals alike).

Fast forward a week and a half. From day one, dog is up throughout the night. I told husband I'd done the nightshift with all our babies and I wasn't doing it for a dog so he's been up with him every night. He barks. Non stop. And I know it's because he wants a playmate but he's extremely aggressive in play. He's a scratcher and a biter and I've got three small kids (2, 5, 7). Just this morning I had to tear his teeth away from 2 year old's panties because he was biting her booty. :( He has marked every room in the house, and I'm paranoid I missed a spot with my carpet scrubber and that the whole house is gonna smell like dog piss. Refuses to use a puppy pad. He has pooped on our living room rug countless times (woke up to two more piles today). Last week, we discovered fully grown worms in the poop. Pulsating. Moving. On.our.rug. 

Last Friday, I convinced (or so I thought) my husband enough was enough. We made an appt to surrender him to a local no-kill shelter on Saturday. And then an hour before the appt, he decides we're gonna keep the dog. Cue huge fight and a $50 trip to the pet store for dewormer and dog food. And a $75 trip to Lowe's for garden fencing because dog has been pulling my vegetable plants apart 😠

That night was the worst the dog's been. Would not settle down for sleep and then up literally every hour. My husband had to sleep on the couch because it was the only thing that'd semi-calm the puppy down. (No way in hell is puppy coming in our bedroom.) I think it was needed though because it was the final straw for my gracious, patient husband. He finally admitted I was right and this wasn't working out. Shelter was closed Sunday, so he had to wait till yesterday to make another surrender appt. And an appt wasn't available until today. 1 pm. 5 more hours until this puppy is out of my life. Ahhhhh.

I hope this post is allowed. I just needed to vent to people who GET IT. It's not that I hate dogs. I just don't understand why people want them. Why people bring them into their clean, quiet homes.

&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, I convinced (or so I thought) my husband enough was enough. We made an appt to surrender him to a local no-kill shelter on Saturday. And then an hour before the appt, he decides we&amp;#39;re gonna keep the dog. Cue huge fight and a $50 trip to the pet store for dewormer and dog food. And a $75 trip to Lowe&amp;#39;s for garden fencing because dog has been pulling my vegetable plants apart 😠&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night was the worst the dog&amp;#39;s been. Would not settle down for sleep and then up literally every hour. My husband had to sleep on the couch because it was the only thing that&amp;#39;d semi-calm the puppy down. (No way in hell is puppy coming in our bedroom.) I think it was needed though because it was the final straw for my gracious, patient husband. He finally admitted I was right and this wasn&amp;#39;t working out. Shelter was closed Sunday, so he had to wait till yesterday to make another surrender appt. And an appt wasn&amp;#39;t available until today. 1 pm. 5 more hours until this puppy is out of my life. Ahhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post is allowed. I just needed to vent to people who GET IT. It&amp;#39;s not that I hate dogs. I just don&amp;#39;t understand why people want them. Why people bring them into their clean, quiet homes. They. Are. Animals.&lt;/p&gt;

Don't know how to link it but I guess you can search it if you want to read it.  Puppy is now almost 12 weeks.   Behavior in some ways has gotten better.  Seems like he is considered a very calm puppy by most standards.      He learns commands easily, but unless you have a treat to give him, he doesn't listen to those commands like ""leave it"", when he wants to chew on your shoe.  Or ""off"" when he wants to jump on the couch.  I know he's young, but I unfortunately don't have a year to devote to training the way the training programs work.  There are literally people telling me to take him out every 30 minutes to pee (still nowhere near housebroken because although he goes to the back door and rings a bell when he has to go out, if you don't get to him within seconds he will just pee on the floor), spend 15 minutes 4 times a day to train him,  roll up any area rugs and put all toys away, etc .   Do people really do this?    I can't even cook dinner without stopping every 5 seconds to reprimand him for taking something off the couch, eating a houseplant, sticking his nose into the fireplace , chewing on a wire, grabbing someone's shoes, etc.     So although he is a ""good"" puppy, this puppy stuff sucks!!

But here is my dilemma.  My 2 sons and my husband want to keep him and train him.   My husband is never home so it would just be my 2 sons, but they are getting older and busier.  This will absolutely fall on me in the next few years.  So even if he is the best behaved, most well trained compliant dog on the planet, I will be restricting my life to come home and let the dog pee and poop at some point.  I don't need to list all of the other downsides to owning a dog that have hit me like a ton of bricks.   But he is soooooo cute.   And my 14 year old, in particular, LOVES dogs.  He has been doing most of the work and seems committed.      I feel like I would be breaking his heart to take away this dog.  I talked to my husband about converting our mud room in to a dog room, with a doggie door to a backyard fenced run.   Likely will cost about $1000.   Then my son would have the dog he loves but I wouldn't have him up my butt all day long, and we could live a little without having to run home so he could pee.   But in my heart I also feel like this isn't fair to the dog.  Contrary to a lot of people here, I don't hate dogs.  I just don't want them in my home lol.    I don't even feel like it's humane to have brought these animals into an unnatural environment and then restrict their lives to the point they cannot eat, drink, or defecate without help from us.   I am basically an animal lover I guess.   I respect nature and that includes animals.  I wont even kill a spider.  I just happen to believe that they don't belong as pets.   That we shouldn't be bringing them into our homes and making them live OUR type of life.   That it's unfair to the animals and also insane for humans to even want it and ""own a pet"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's also unfair to leave him in a crate when we aren't home, or when we want to eat a meal.  It's the only way we can eat in peace.   I know that with hundreds of hours of training he could be well behaved, but no one here has that kind of time.     So we went to a movie as a family and left him in a crate.  He did fine, likely slept the whole time, and didn't pee or poo in the crate.  So everyone was happy.  I  think its crazy and cruel.   ""Here....live in a cage so that when I have time to play with you and feel like letting you out to pee that you will be waiting for me"".   Its mean.  And literally takes up so much of your time that there is no time left to do anything else.    For example, my son has been trying to watch a 30 minute tv show for about 2 hours now and he is chasing the puppy, feeding him, giving him water endlessly,  then taking him out to pee almost every 15 minutes.   He is jumping on my daughter who has had to move all of her toys into another room to play, and now only plays behind the other side of the gates.   A puppy is running our home!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

But I just can't help but feel that I'm wrong to take this away from my son.  EVERYONE has a dog.  Doesn't every kid need a dog?   HE says that all the other kids on his soccer team have dogs.  Dogs are everywhere we look.  They are so cute...even to me.   But when you aren't looking at a picture, and you are living with them, especially a puppy, it feels like you would have to be nuts.    It's like this mass hysteria telling me they are wonderful to have around and play with, and take places, and have sitting at your feet, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm hoping you guys here  can help bring me back down to earth to believe that my sons will be ok without this dog in their life.   They both love dogs so much that they talked me into this and it was a mistake.  A mistake that I can't correct without hurting my kids in some way.  I dont' know if I can live with this dog, but maybe I should sacrifice everything and be a good mother and suck it up so that they can be happy.     Another $1000 and maybe the dog won't be miserable being outside a little, will be able to be content to go in and out of the doggie door and have some independence, and won't bark its head off when it's alone.  And won't have to be in a crate when we want to leave our home.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do we do this to ourselves???      Why couldn't my sons be happy with their cat?    I have a newfound love for cats that leave you the hell alone most of the time and can pee and poop without needing a leash and a bell and scratching at the door and requires you to be home to help them every 30 minutes and doesn't beg for food ALL DAY LONG, and watch you when you go into the kitchen, try to get into the refrigerator, climb up your butt no matter what you are doing, need attention EVERY SINGLE SECOND.    My GoD!! I've raised 4 kids and none of them was this difficult.

HELP!!!  How can I find peace in this situation?   Even my husband is making me feel guilty because he likes dogs so much, even though he doesn't do anything at all since he's never home and has zero ability to understand my perspective that I am finally in a place where I don't have to be supervising my kids' every move and want some more freedom.  I can't even stand to be home anymore.  There is no peace unless the dog is sleeping in his crate.   It's crazy.

One of them is a rescue from Mexico and suffers from what I expect is mental handicap as a result, but my complaint seems to apply to them all.

So- when defending my (and other) dogs' actions, I mostly hear one of two defenses: ""he/she can't help it"", or ""he/she loves you and misses you"". The former is when they are stealing, the latter when they are destroying our property.

I guess what it comes down to is that I don't understand how this is *companionship*. If a dog is a mindless beast that will steal from you every chance it can get regardless of clear indications that it upsets you, that *stealing the food my children are trying to eat* sends me into a rage, then how does it then choose to be your 'best friend'? It's a mindless thing, driven by its alligator-brained instincts. To me, that isn't love. Conversely, if your dog is going to bark- again, mindlessly, without regard for context- and destroy every door you put between you and it, how is this companionship? What about this behavior benefits you? It's utter dependency- you can bring a pet rock with you to the grocery store and lose Zero doors.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not a sociopath. I understand loving something that doesn't love you back or is even incapable of it. I read *The Little Prince* to my kids like a hundred times. Hell, I have cats, a corn snake and four chickens- and I love the *crap out of those chickens*.

I simply don't understand how the benefits of 'companionship' with a dog outweigh in any way the companionship from an animal that doesn't perpetually destroy or vandalize.

End rant.

P.S. - I know training can help with both of these exhibited behaviors, and I don't think that's relevant to the point. I don't have to train my chickens not to attack my kids or steal food off the table. They're stupid, but they're *harmlessly stupid*.

I've got a bit of a problem that I don't know how to navigate it. My friend and I are in positions where we’re finally able to move out on our own. The problem at hand is he wants us to move in together and I don’t know how to politely say no. I’m not good at saying ‘no’ to anything really. I’m totally a pushover but I don’t want to live with him because of his three dogs.

Two are giant pit bulls that scare me and a smaller terrier looking dog. He’s a typical dog over lover and thinks this trio can do no wrong. Whenever I’m over at his house, I constantly feel on edge because the big ones watch me like a hawk and go barking mad over quick movements or loud noise from anyone or anything in the house. The small one pisses everywhere so his mom’s house stinks now. It didn’t smell like that until he moved home with those dogs. He lived in a few places before coming back to town and none were too bad until the last place where the animals started coming into play. His house quickly became a shithole that was enabled by a roommate who had the same animal loving habit accompanied by a disinterest in cleaning.

I’ve been looking at apartments for myself and found a nice place that doesn’t allow dogs over 25lbs and have a strict pet policy. I’ve got a small dog that will be my very last pet once she dies so it would be a perfect starter place for me. Despite my growing hatred of dogs, I don’t want a situation where anyone or anything is going to get hurt and moving in with those dogs is a chance for something very ugly to happen.

I feel like I’m going to ruin a friendship and I don't have many of those so I'm terrified of losing someone over this shit. I just don't want to live in a dirty or potentially dangerous household. Sensitive is definitely a word I would use for him, especially when it comes to putting blame on those dogs. I've known him over 20 years but a piece of me feels my refusal would be seen as betrayal or abandonment in his eyes. Has anyone had a similar situation? Any advice that might help me out?

I would posts this to r/relationships but I know I’d just get blasted for not sleeping with dogs and getting fleas.

7. ""Is the dog ok?""

The only one I agree with is the last one, but this idea that when you adopt a dog (or any animal really) that you have to keep it forever no matter what life or hardship you go through is ridiculous.

I know this isn't the ""popular"" opinion but I am not with the idea of forever animals. Shit happens with animals. Sometimes they do get aggressive around kids, sometimes you get allergies when previously there weren't any, sometimes the place that you move into doesn't allow certain animals, sometimes significant others have fears or allergies.

I see this happen more with dogs than cats or rabbits or hamsters, and I don't like the ""i LiKe aNiMaLs mOrE tHaN hUmAnS"", furmommy/furdaddy/furbaby, or ""doggos are so pure and good humans dont deserve them uwuwu"" (and the whole thing about Dog Culture is another conversation entirely) weird attitude that people have adopted lately and I find it kind of baffling that people are willing to cater their entire lives around pets.

^ Anyone who is not blind should be able to see that this is not normal. That is not how a canine should look.

This is not a poor area and is all people who own larger houses and a few with horses and such along the way. Everyday there are people walking dogs on the side of the road so I pay attention.

Just now, I went out to Walmart. So on the way I past 2 cops just in that stretch of road. On the way back, I see a random black dog like a collie or something big like that in the middle of this regular two way road completely unaware of it's self or my car. So I'm approaching and going the speed limit (30) and I slow to like 27 maybe as I approach and watch this idiot oblivious to me.im thinking I will hit this idiot if he doesn't bother to move. No people or owners in sight. 

Luckily for him, as I approach, he now is on the yellow line and running alongside my car. So I shake my head and drive on, pass the cross street (this is all residential area) and lo and behold I see a group of 3 people 2 adults and 1 laughing kid watching from their golf cart on the side of the road and dumb mutt running happily over towards them.

I was sooooooo tempted to roll down the window and yell ""next time he's getting hit"" and I decided this is the one get out of jail free card I will give. Next time I'm yelling at them and reporting it. 

We do have a leash law here, so I think I will actually make a complaint to the sheriff's depts (who apparently handles it as they once wrongfully put a letter in our mailbox meant for someone else stating they were looking for 'feral cats'.... Yes and they aren't any of those) tomorrow and make them aware. 2 cops of this road and still off lease dog? (Usually they are leashed but still....) But those cops sure cracked down on me giving me a speeding ticket on that road when I first moved in in October and was going 10 mph over (limit goes from 35-30 within a few feet) ugh I know it's not related but still. 

Yes this is Florida.

Best ways to report this? Thanks

Sorry for auto correcting the leash typo lol","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I live in a rural area and it&amp;#39;s 2.4 miles from my house down the long road to the stop sign at the street junction to actually go anywhere. This is not a poor area and is all people who own larger houses and a few with horses and such along the way. Everyday there are people walking dogs on the side of the road so I pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just now, I went out to Walmart. So on the way I past 2 cops just in that stretch of road. On the way back, I see a random black dog like a collie or something big like that in the middle of this regular two way road completely unaware of it&amp;#39;s self or my car. So I&amp;#39;m approaching and going the speed limit (30) and I slow to like 27 maybe as I approach and watch this idiot oblivious to me.im thinking I will hit this idiot if he doesn&amp;#39;t bother to move. No people or owners in sight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for him, as I approach, he now is on the yellow line and running alongside my car. So I shake my head and drive on, pass the cross street (this is all residential area) and lo and behold I see a group of 3 people 2 adults and 1 laughing kid watching from their golf cart on the side of the road and dumb mutt running happily over towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sooooooo tempted to roll down the window and yell &amp;quot;next time he&amp;#39;s getting hit&amp;quot; and I decided this is the one get out of jail free card I will give. Next time I&amp;#39;m yelling at them and reporting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have a leash law here, so I think I will actually make a complaint to the sheriff&amp;#39;s depts (who apparently handles it as they once wrongfully put a letter in our mailbox meant for someone else stating they were looking for &amp;#39;feral cats&amp;#39;....

&lt;p&gt;This is why dogparent culture is dangerous and not a “live and let live” type of thing. It encourages people into being as delusional as LW’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking through the list of adoptable animals at my local humane society, I noticed the content of the bios of the animals. This mainly applies to cats and dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

The bios all have something about the pet ""looking for its furever home and wanting someone to show them love."" This pissed me off because, in reality, animals aren't looking for a 'forever home.'

It makes humans look like a god and savior, that they need us. In reality, animals don't need love and emotional nurturing like people do. We tack on ""socialization"" for dogs because if they aren't, they are a nuisance at best, a danger at worst.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I own cat. I don't believe pet ownership is going to get abolished any time soon, but the least I can do is acknowledge that the reason I got a cat is because I like and wanted one. Not because the cat needed me to love it and give it a home. I keep my cat inside a house, microchip so if she were to get out, she would be returned to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

We collar/microchip pets, keep them in houses, leashes, and crates because legally, they are our property.  But most dog nuts seem to use the reason of 'companionship' for getting a dog. Companionship, at least in my eyes, is something like a best friend or spouse. You do not buy your companion. You do not own your companion. The reason a companion is special is because they have the freedom to leave you, but they don't, cause they genuinely care about you.

If you own a pitbull, do you really think I should give a fuck about your opinion? Do you think I should care if you prioritize canine lives over human children, or all humans for that matter? I know this has been done multiple times in this subreddit, I just want to get some ranting off my chest finally. So I'm going to debunk some of the common arguments shitbull owners make.

Argument 1: ""But pitbulls are sweet creatures!""

Ok common sense dipshit, if pitbulls are sweet then why are they the most dangerous dog breed? Why are they almost the only breed you see on articles about dog attacks? Oh, I dont know, maybe they just don't belong in this society and should stop breeding. But hey, nice to know you support the deaths of hundreds of children who were mauled to DEATH because of a shitbull. I'm sure for your statement that 1, 2, 3, ZERO people will thank you for it. You claim you're self righteous but to be self righteous is be confident in your own morality. But clearly you don't seem to have that. If you get injured in some way no matter how severe it is and you havr a pitbull, i WONT feel sorry for you.

Argument 2: ""But its the owners fault!""

You see this damn comment on every damn shitbull attack article to ever exist. But hey, even if the dog was being hurt by them in some way, you still use this argument if its a damn child. And for everyone else, apparently they think that every single last pitbull attack to an adolescent or adult was from abuse. Yeah, OK. We need to be mature about situations like this and not just toss around excuses.

Argument 3: ""So? Animals are better than humans""

Oh sure they are. The species that went into space, built whole civilizations and are moral are apparently worse than the species who hump legs, eat shit, and sniff asses. Listen, if you'd actually save a dog over a human then congratulations, you abandoned your own intellegent species for a bunch of mutts. One human can dedicate more to society than 1,000 dogs. So why shouldn't humans be considered better than dogs, huh?

Damn, that felt good to get off my chest alright seeya

Edit: oh, and saying the dog was just playing, but that needs no explanation why its bullshit","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a question to all pitbull owners out there. If you own a pitbull, do you really think I should give a fuck about your opinion? Do you think I should care if you prioritize canine lives over human children, or all humans for that matter? I know this has been done multiple times in this subreddit, I just want to get some ranting off my chest finally. So I&amp;#39;m going to debunk some of the common arguments shitbull owners make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argument 1: &amp;quot;But pitbulls are sweet creatures!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok common sense dipshit, if pitbulls are sweet then why are they the most dangerous dog breed? Why are they almost the only breed you see on articles about dog attacks? Oh, I dont know, maybe they just don&amp;#39;t belong in this society and should stop breeding. But hey, nice to know you support the deaths of hundreds of children who were mauled to DEATH because of a shitbull. I&amp;#39;m sure for your statement that 1, 2, 3, ZERO people will thank you for it. You claim you&amp;#39;re self righteous but to be self righteous is be confident in your own morality. But clearly you don&amp;#39;t seem to have that. If you get injured in some way no matter how severe it is and you havr a pitbull, i WONT feel sorry for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argument 2: &amp;quot;But its the owners fault!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see this damn comment on every damn shitbull attack article to ever exist. But hey, even if the dog was being hurt by them in some way, you still use this argument if its a damn child. And for everyone else, apparently they think that every single last pitbull attack to an adolescent or adult was from abuse. Yeah, OK. We need to be mature about situations like this and not just toss around excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argument 3: &amp;quot;So? Animals are better than humans&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh sure they are. The species that went into space, built whole civilizations and are moral are apparently worse than the species who hump legs, eat shit, and sniff asses. Listen, if you&amp;#39;d actually save a dog over a human then congratulations, you abandoned your own intellegent species for a bunch of mutts. One human can dedicate more to society than 1,000 dogs. So why shouldn&amp;#39;t humans be considered better than dogs, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

Of coarse I saw a pretty popular video on instagram with over 1 million veiws about a french bulldog cornering a clearly terrified iguana and grabbing said iguana by the tail and violently swinging it around while the owner just films.

So I look to see what the lovely veiwers think about this (bad idea I know) and thankfully there were a few comments calling this out but of coarse most of the comment is filled with shitbeast lovers making fun of people for being concerned about the iguanas wellbeing, saying things like ""who cares it's just a dumb lizard"" and ""the dog was just playing"" "" iguanas are an invasive species anyway"" , spouting extremely false reptile ""facts"" and laughing at this shit.

Ok. So if the dog was just playing and it's enjoyment is more important than the lizards wellbeing does that mean that I can swing a dog around for amusement? Can a baby slap a dog because it thinks it's hilarious? Can a horse trample dogs because they're ""just playing"" Of coarse not because if any of those things happened dog lovers would raise a fucking temper tantrum.

It's an invasive species so it makes it ok to torment it? Dogs are an invasive species too that do so much more destruction than iguanas. Dogs like french bulldogs and pugs can't even reproduce naturally or fucking breathe.

Who cares it's just a dumb lizard? Reptiles are much, much smarter than we give them credit for, just because they don't show as much expression as dogs doesn't mean they are unintelligent, it just shows how stupid dog nuts are, they can only understand and respect/empathize with the most inbred mushed brain animal that was created for humans enjoyment there is, which is why wild animals don't act like toddlers on cocaine, they don't need to to survive, that doesn't make them stupid, quite the opposite actually

And it wouldn't be true dog nutter bullshittery if they weren't attacking people for petty unrelated things like race or like amounts, but dont worry!! Their was plenty of that!!!

Apologies in advance if it is all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

We've all heard the ""it's all in how you raise them"" ""Bad dogs come from bad owners"" and ""Breed doesn't matter"" spiel. ""Just give it enough love and socialization and it will be a good dog. "" ""My dog would never!!! He's the sweetest thing!""

&amp;#x200B;

These people think you can control a dog's behavior with 'training.' Training does have a significant impact on dogs, but nowadays, well-trained dogs are becoming rarer and rarer. Everyone thinks their dog is trained well or are ""working on it."" They make different excuses and sugar-coated terms such as a 3-year old dog ""still being a puppy."" Can be a little ""mouthy."" It pissing everywhere is just due to ""excitement."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite that their dog is well-trained and the sweetest thing ever. I also hate how ""sweet"" used to describe them. Literally everyone says that, even if their dog has sent someone to the hospital or killed pets. I don't know who to trust, so I don't trust any of them. I urge you to, as well. There may be ""sweet"" dogs out there, but I ain't risking my face to find out.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, back to the training thing. I seriously believe these nuts think their dog has a mind of its own. That people are the god over their dog's behavior. They think their dog wouldn't hurt any other animal. When that is proven wrong they use these overly-regurgitated terms: ""I don't know what happened, he's never done this before!"" ""Bella was just playing!"" ""Blue didn't mean to hurt them, he feels bad about it!""

&amp;#x200B;

When such events happen, nutters are faced with the reality that their dog runs on instinct and genetics. In other words, it has a fucking mind of its own. Not a surprise to me. But they cannot handle this fact, so it turns into a DARVO situation.

I believe abusing animals is bad, obviously, so I treat her well outwardly but when I see her all that I feel is a vague relief that dogs have limited lifespans so that one day she will die and I can put my foot down on never having another animal in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

So,to much of a lot of some people's surprise,dogs were not venerated in ancient times,they were seen as being quite dirty,the quran sees them as dirty,the bible does too,we should all know of the proverb :"" He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas"",also keep in mind that by ancient times I mean anything that was before the 20th or late 19th century or so,if opinions of dogs greatly fluctuated somewhere in history,i'd enjoy learning about it.

Anyway,so dogs were seen as dirty for a long long time in the past,and keep in mind that this was *before* the revolution of hygiene that we have today,tBose people would not do things like wash their hands,and showering was a yearly thing,if at all!But even so,with everyone in those times being so dirty,they still thought of dogs as incredibly dirty creatures.

And now,after so many structural and technological and social and etc etc ... advancements,we're at a point where we can get clean water (except flint lol) to wash ourselves,we wash after every meal,we wash our clothes every time we wear them,we wash our bodies daily with special made chemicals to get all possible germs off,we clean our houses almost excessively,can you count the amount of different sprays and methods you use to wash all the dust off your furniture?We've gotten so clean it's literally uncomparable to the living conditions of past,where your whole body was a mess of mud,dirt,dust,and literally everything in the enviroment,most of us couldn't even imagine living in those times.

So,now we know that a) people ,even in ye olden times,thought dogs were really dirty and b)we've gotten so much cleaner compared to then that it's baffling,so the normal conclusion would be that dogs are now relegated to zoos,or circuses,or just forests or anywhere outside of society,because their natural filth would completely clash against the standards of hygiene of the 21st century

There are dogs in more than half the houses around here, the neighborhood really has ""gone to the dogs"", but that is a topic for another discussion.

Every year on social media my neighbors start complaining about the fireworks last year and how scared their sweet innocent dog gets when it hears a big boom. Cries of ""fireworks are illegal!"" and ""they need to ban the sale of fireworks everywhere"" all because one night a year people make more noise than their dogs do every other day of the year.

The following are excerpts from one such thread;

""Every 4th of July and New Year's is the worst for my now 14yo dog. She gets so scared, she doesn't stop shaking. At the house, we stay home for the night. Get all the noise-distractions ready: playlist on Alexa in the kitchen, YouTube videos on autoplay, closed windows/sliding doors, turn on portable AC for cooling and white noise, plenty treats for each time something goes off, CBD biscuits to calm the nerves. We time meal/potty schedules, watch the water intake, and try to squeeze in one more walk before sun goes down. Then we stay up thru 2,3am while she falls asleep cuz there's always sudden bangs and explosions in the dead of night.""

Wow, what a fucking nightmare. If I didn't get kept up past midnight by barking all through the Summer I might have sympathy.

""I don't know why people must set off fireworks.  There are plenty of professional displays, and fireworks are dangerous, and the impact they have on people with PTSD and pets is just terrible.  Oh, and they're usually illegal!""

Letting your dog bark all day and night is also illegal, off leash dog walking is illegal, not picking up dog shit is illegal yet I see it all the time every single day.

""I have four dogs and i dont look forward to the fourth of July at all. All my dogs get very upset before, during and after the fourth. This year i am going to try a sedative from the vet. I just cant go through it again and they are just miserable and inconsolable!""

I'm not sure why I revel in this person's discomfort, having four dogs is a bit excessive I think and you get what you deserve at that point.

""Supposedly it is illegal to use fireworks within the city limits of Seattle.  It was terrible last year and some were still being set off after midnight.  They should ban the sale of fireworks to the general public.""

Long have I dreamed of the day we the people ban the breeding, sale and harboring of canine animals as pets.

""Sadly I have to give my 7 yr old pup anti anxiety meds which I hate to do. Even then every noise maker in the house is on and  I sequester her in my bedroom where in her panicked state she can’t hurt herself or anything else except occasionally me as I try to comfort her until 2-3am. PLEASE DON’T USE illegal fireworks/ crackers in the neighborhoods! The city ones wreak enough havoc. Thank you""

They make having a dog sound like caring for a genetic mutant with underdeveloped intelligence that can barely understand it's environment, reacting to stimulus in violent and unpredictable ways. What a joy that must be!

""I'm sorry that you have to go through all of that just to protect your pet's health.  I surely understand.  Many people with ptsd also have a very hard time with the loud, abrupt noises over a prolonged period.  I wish that everyone cared enough to not participate in the noise.""

I wish that everyone with dogs cared enough to not let their dogs bark at nothing for no goddamned reason, ahh the power of wishes.

""I hear you. It used to be so bad for my now 11 year old that one year I drove to Canada to avoid it all. Wouldn't you know the spot I picked up in Vancouver was having a Celebrate the U.S. event! Tons of fireworks. Anyway my little guy has gotten SO much better after using liquid tincture of CBD but it alot of cases it takes some time, like a week, to really kick in so you might want to start now. It's helped him in so many ways. Prior to that I did Benadryl which worked ok. You get a sleepy anxious dog. I'd used Benadryl for years for his allergies (now on Apoquel), it's safe in the right dose.""

Hahahahaha there is no escape! Just like when I head out into nature and every hiker has a dog with them and they think it's okay to just let the dog run up the trail and out of their sight so not only do I have to look out for wildlife but an aggressive dog could also be lurking around every corner.

Now here are some excerpts from posts about barking dogs;

""4:30 am every day, a million crows screaming, then the robins with the same 5 notes over and over. My dog sleeps through it all. This city should do something about.""

Other animals make noise too so why is it a big deal?

""I'm sorry but you are mistaken if you think it's (dog's name) as I'm his neighbor and the only time they bark is when they are alone and dog walkers go by.  They don't bark when (dog's owner) is home and certainly not at 5:00 am which I would know as our bedroom is on the front and that would wake us up which hasn't happened. Having said that, (dog's owner) was gone all last summer with his dogs as well as the last couple of weeks with his dogs so I'm going to suggest you bark up another tree.""

Oh yes that is so much better that they only bark he's not home and whenever people walk by so basically all day long, totally acceptable.

""WOW I CANT BELIEVE THAT YOU POSTED THIS!  I tried to complain about a neighbor of mine with barking dog &amp; got attacked by my neighbors for complaining.""

This is the case every single time, the dog owners really outnumber the rest of us here.

""I have neighbors with 2 barkers. Can be frustrating. I haven’t yet complained because I assumed the dogs were doing what Dogs sometimes do. Protecting territory.""

The dog has a right to bark that supersedes your right to peace and quiet

""I cannot sit here with the understanding that a letter has been signed and the Animal Control is being asked to be involved.  I can only suggest that everyone should ""be careful what you hope for"". I live at the head of the ""dog walkers path to the field"" and there are 6 dogs (at a minimum) that live within 200' of each other with probably 200 passersby with dogs each and every day. Of course this does not include all the other households (that have dogs) within earshot and to suggest that because you found any one dog barking at any one time does not make them responsible for all the so called breachs of the peace you claim! Perhaps you might like to consider that hearing a dog barking means there is something to bark at.  As a designer &amp; a builder, I tell people if they are concerned about security, they should get a dog, not a security system. I choose to build and move here for many reasons but a strong one was that it felt safe. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR when you go whinning to a government official about some preceived problem! Dogs make noise, get over it!""

Then there's this gem that I posted before, I don't really have words for this level of insanity.

""Dogs bark for good reasons... by dog logic.  Barking is communication. Speaking as an owner of dogs, I agree that it's terribly rude to allow that dog to bark continuously outside in the very early morning. It's also pretty cruel to the dog.  That dog is trying to tell its owners something.  For whatever reason, they don't seem to be listening, or worse, don't care.  Which frustrates the dog, so it continues to bark, because its instincts tell it that's what it's supposed to do. Are there coyotes in the area?  Are there cats wandering through the neighborhood at night?   I'll be cynical and guess that the dog was barking inside because it was hearing something suspicious.  The owners decided to solve their problem by putting the dog outside and making it their neighbors' problem. My dogs can hear through closed windows people walking on the pavement 40 yards away,  They will bark until I reassure them that there's no problem.  Training a dog not to bark is a very odd idea - would you try to train a toddler not to cry if he/she is in pain or afraid?  Better idea, train the owner to pay attention to why the dog is barking.   If a dog is barking out of anxiety, fear, or aggression, a responsible owner deals with the underlying cause.  If the dog is barking to warn the owner about what the dog believes is a threat \[the usual situation\], the owner pays attention and deals with the threat.""

Or... they bark out of boredom and giving them attention reinforces the idea that barking is a great way to get attention when you are bored.

""Go feed it. He will stop barking! He can't bark &amp; eat! LoL""

I know it's a joke but the level of insensitivity insinuating that it is my responsibility to do something for the dog makes my blood boil.

""Dogs bark, should bark and are expected to bark. I like dogs! And they bark! 1 to 2 minutes, heck even 5 minutes or throughout the day, totally cool. 😊""

There is no getting through to some people but at least I can count on the 4th of July to give them a chance to see disruptive noise from the other side. Just seems like they are too far gone to gain any perspective.

If a dog is barking out of anxiety, fear, or aggression, a responsible owner deals with the underlying cause.  If the dog is barking to warn the owner about what the dog believes is a threat [the usual situation], the owner pays attention and deals with the threat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or... they bark out of boredom and giving them attention reinforces the idea that barking is a great way to get attention when you are bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go feed it. He will stop barking! He can&amp;#39;t bark &amp;amp; eat! LoL&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a joke but the level of insensitivity insinuating that it is my responsibility to do something for the dog makes my blood boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dogs bark, should bark and are expected to bark. I like dogs! And they bark! 1 to 2 minutes, heck even 5 minutes or throughout the day, totally cool. 😊&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no getting through to some people but at least I can count on the 4th of July to give them a chance to see disruptive noise from the other side. Just seems like they are too far gone to gain any perspective. Thanks you dogfree community for letting me rant.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel that having a dog has made me much more comfortable approaching other dogs I see. 

That’s where today went wrong,

I was having some ice cream on my porch and noticed a dog going down my block. Clearly lost, I tried to be a helping person and save the dog. I know if my poor pup was out there, I’d want someone to save him. 

I approached the dog and had a big ole smile and whistled for him to come to me. He sprinted further down the street. Being persistent, I followed him. As we got further down the street, he turned and faced me. I became a little intimated. Instantly he put his teeth out and began to growl. I began slowly backing up. I knew that running back towards my house may entice him to chase me. But, he began sprinting towards me anyways. I took of like lighting. Granted, I’m very fast and was definitely out running him but he was right behind me. But about 5-6 seconds into my full on sprint, I kept looking behind me to see how far behind he was, I lost my balance and began fall, I went down and skidded across the street. I thought the dog was going to pounce and jump on my face. When I got up he was already headed the opposite direction.

I lost an entire layer of skin on my hip. My elbow is still numb and had a giant gash. My foot was cut, (probably a bad idea to go bare footed), my shoulder blade and back were all bleeding and cut. I’m just very sore now.

I learned a lot today. I won’t be as willing to approach dogs I don’t know and some dogs are not as friendly as I though they were.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, I have a dog and enjoy his company and love him very much. I feel that having a dog has made me much more comfortable approaching other dogs I see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where today went wrong,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having some ice cream on my porch and noticed a dog going down my block. Clearly lost, I tried to be a helping person and save the dog. I know if my poor pup was out there, I’d want someone to save him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached the dog and had a big ole smile and whistled for him to come to me. He sprinted further down the street. Being persistent, I followed him. As we got further down the street, he turned and faced me. I became a little intimated. Instantly he put his teeth out and began to growl. I began slowly backing up. I knew that running back towards my house may entice him to chase me. But, he began sprinting towards me anyways. I took of like lighting. Granted, I’m very fast and was definitely out running him but he was right behind me. But about 5-6 seconds into my full on sprint, I kept looking behind me to see how far behind he was, I lost my balance and began fall, I went down and skidded across the street. I thought the dog was going to pounce and jump on my face. When I got up he was already headed the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost an entire layer of skin on my hip. My elbow is still numb and had a giant gash. My foot was cut, (probably a bad idea to go bare footed), my shoulder blade and back were all bleeding and cut. I’m just very sore now.&lt;/p&gt;

Until last weekend...

I went to visit some friends in a major metropolitan area. They live in a luxurious high rise (30 stories) apartment building. It is fairly new, so of course it caters to dog nutters, with amenities like a dog spa and artificial turf outside for a delightful open air dog toilet.  I could not believe the sheer number of dogs in this building.  They were running free in the lobby and hallways. When going into my friend's apartment, the two dogs next door bolted out their door (left ajar) barking and jumping on me, not once, but twice! Walking down any hallway was like being in a dog shelter with constant barking.

Fortunately I am neither allergic nor afraid of dogs, but I was really taken aback by the level of nuttery going on in this very expensive building. The density of dogs was just overwhelming. The outdoor artificial turf basically smelled like an open sewer.  And of course, the nutters then moved over to destroy the real grass area which was also covered in brown spots and dog poo. To top things off, I finally saw the obligatory dog in a stroller.

I apologize to all apartment dwellers for doubting you in the slightest.

I live in Greece where we have a pretty big stray dogs-cats problem but i am ok with them. I am not scared, and sometimes there are cases of pack of dogs attacking people but myself i haven't had the experience. I came close couple of times but i was aggressive enough or they were scared of me so nothing happened.

 
I am venting now because of a facebook post i came across. Summer in my country is pretty nice. Thousands upon thousands (seriously look it up) miles of coastline. Quite beautiful and accessible too. Long beaches with cafes-snack bars -tavernas with their sunbeds and tables and so on. Many different establishments one after another. And the post was for ONE cafe/snack bar with access to the beach, which did not allowed dogs. 

And people were losing their minds! They were calling the owner/s all short of horrible names and flooded their facebook page with negative name calling, yelling comments! Wishing for his/hers bussiness to close! Ok lets leave 20 people without work on the middle of the tourist season bc that is what Greece with 40% unemployment rate amongst the youth under 25 of years needs right now.I was dumbfounded. I do not know the cafe nor the beach itself but from i could tell it wasn't the only one in the beach. There were plenty of others, if it is as like on many other beaches in my country. So if you don't like it,well, go to the next one! Or the one after that! Nobody is forcing you to sit on that cafe! You have every right to decline to give your money at a bussiness you don't like and they have a right to decline to do bussiness with you if it goes against their rules of their bussiness. They were not illegal and they were plenty of similar establishments near by to accomodate your needs.Maybe the owner is the devil himself/herself as you believe or maybe a dog attacked someone in his premises and got sued to the roof and doesn't want to take any chances. Maybe he/she really is a horrible man/woman but why do you insist to take your dog where is not wanted or even liked? Why make it such a big fuss about it in the internet? They don't like dogs! That is nothing, i know this guy who doesn't like souvlaki! Now that, for me, shows me that this person in not human, a lizard maybe, but not one of us.This was my vent. 


There are of course of million of other beaches to be found with no cafes no sunbeds no loud music and very few people or even no other people if you are lucky and very few chances to come across with a dog.


But even if that happens the beach is  nice the sea is so calm and welcoming and beautiful that you don't really mind at the end.

Under Title III of the federal **Americans with Disabilities Act** (**ADA**) and virtually all state laws, a service animal is an animal that has been trained to perform work or tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability. ...

**However - this is where the waters get muddy and the problems begin (Q3)**  
**Q: How can I tell if an animal is really a service animal and not just a pet?**  


Some, but not all, service animals wear special collars and harnesses. Some, but not all, are licensed or certified and have identification papers. If you are not certain that an animal is a service animal, you may ask the person who has the animal if it is a service animal required because of a disability. However, an individual who is going to a restaurant or theater is not likely to be carrying documentation of his or her medical condition or disability. Therefore, such documentation generally may not be required as a condition for providing service to an individual accompanied by a service animal. Although a number of states have programs to certify service animals, you may not insist on proof of state certification before permitting the service animal to accompany the person with a disability.

&amp;#x200B;

It reminds me of when Juul (vaping tobacco) came on the scene and there were no regulations because it was new. The government is now trying to crack down on selling this stuff to kids and trying to understand the product's safety.

&amp;#x200B;

This ESA thing is new. When the ADA was passed in 1990, it was a good thing. Truly meant to help those with disabilities be able to lead an improved life. Sadly all of these entitled nutters have taken advantage of this and hurt those with service dogs (and infringed upon all of our rights.) And, it's going to take them a while to get around (if ever) to change this regulation. It's got to be very difficult for business owners who through a federal mandate are not allowed to ask for proof.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My closest friend is in HR and she made it clear that the ADA protection applies only to service animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I live on the upper east side of Manhattan - an area known for two things: strollers and freaking dogs. There's a park by the river with a large enclosed playground. It's really popular because it's one of the few places in this dense area where little kids can run free and play. To note: there are in fact TWO dog runs within one minute of this playground, in the same park.

The playground has a no-pet policy posted at the gate.

So I took my daughter to this playground this morning. Morning meant it's usually full of very little children: five and under. There were lots of toddlers who can barely walk practicing all over the place. We walked in - and I immediately saw a family with a freaking pitbull.

A pitbull. A pitbull with a spiked metal collar. A pitbull - sitting right outside of the only entrance to a separately gated area where the swings are. It's not possible to walk to the swings without passing within inches of this animal.

My daughter wanted to go to the swings. I dragged her away. She's not walking past that. Luckily, I saw some park staff near by working. I flagged them down and pointed out the dog. To their credit, they immediately dropped what they were doing and went to tell that family to leave. As they left, the mother looked at me full of indignation. ""She's a service dog"".

A service dog. A pitbull. With metal spikes on its collar. Couldn't even be bothered with a fake ""service dog"" vest.

But this being the upper east side of manhattan, I know all the eyes that were on me were not on my side. I'm the asshole.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Thank god for this community - because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure no one else was on my side).&lt;/p&gt;

The first night they were stomping around, running, and shouting until past midnight. In the morning, I discovered they tore out my plants in my hanging baskets near our door. We rent a house, my family has the downstairs section, and we have a little porch leading to our door. The upstairs have a separate staircase on the other side of the house, so they have no reason to be near our part. 

The best part? They brought a dog. The apartment is strictly pet free, absolutely no dogs allowed which I’m thankful for. But these assholes decided the rules don’t apply to them and brought their dog. It’s been barking and growling nonstop, and all this morning howling and whining. It’s a big dog, and I know the size of that apartment is nowhere near enough space for it, so I know the poor thing is restless and upset. I would think if someone so desperately wanted their dog, they would find a place where they would be welcome and have space for the dog to be comfortable. 

I’m pissed. My mom was already pissed by their rudeness and for tearing out my plants, this is just the cherry on top. She’s going to call the landlord and report them. While I don’t wish for them to be evicted, the landlord is very strict and has these rules for a reason. This isn’t the first time this has happened, so she may just kick them out, which sucks because they literally just moved in. But it’s their own fault, they knew the rules. I don’t have a lot of sympathy for them.

UPDATE: The dog looks to be a Great Dane. I saw the tenant take the dog outside into the backyard. Unleashed, of course. Took a shit back there, most likely not picked up. I took pictures of the dog for proof and sent them to my mother. Hopefully she’ll forward them to the landlord.

UPDATE TWO: My mom called the landlord and filled her in on the situation. Landlord told her that absolutely no animals are allowed and she was not informed of this dog at all. She also kept using the pronoun “he” for the tenant, but the person I saw with the dog was a woman, so most likely someone is staying there that’s not supposed to be.

UPDATE THREE: My mom called the landlord and she told us that she will give them a warning and if they bring the dog back and it starts making noise to notify her again. Then she will evict them. They got the warning and the dog and the girl disappeared for a while. Just now, I saw them coming back with the damn thing and I believe the guy was carrying another puppy. It could’ve been a bag, it was hard to tell, but they are currently upstairs. I texted my mom that they came back with the dog, she replied, “Okay.” Apparently thé dog is 7 months old, and the thing is the size of a Shetland pony.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apartment upstairs just got a new tenant, and although I haven’t formally met them yet, I already dislike them greatly.

After months of debate in my home (myself, my husband, adult daughter, 18 yr old son, 14yr. old son, 10 year old daughter), my husband and I decided to take the plunge and buy the puppy that my sons had been begging for for years.  Since they are older now, we figured they would do most of the work anyway....and they have.  However, it has been a nightmare from day one 

 Supposedly this puppy is ""good for a puppy"" .  But why in hell do people live like this?   It's insane.  Our lives have been completely ripped apart.  We don't sleep the same (up at 5 to pee!!!) , we can't go out, we can't be home in peace, etc.  The puppy is 10 weeks old and we have had him for 2 weeks.   15 times a day to pee, 5 times a day to poop, incessant barking (piercing!) no matter what we do or don't do.  BArking in the crate that is supposed to give us a break from the running around like a lunatic and biting people and things and trying to get on the furniture, barking if someone leaves the room even if other people are still in the room. Barking to out side to play, barking when it has to pee, barking when he is in the crate sleeping and you dare to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, biting us constantly (play biting, but STILL), biting my phone when I'm sitting on a chair with a phone in my hand, jumping on us if we sit on the couch, jumping on my daughter and biting her legs, can't vacuum when he's awake and won't do it when he's asleep because I don't want to wake him up and deal with the crap and barking, can't sit on the couch and watch tv in peace, can't enjoy a meal, can't do laundry because he grabs clothes and bites them, can't read a book, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

However the worst part may be that we can't go out and leave him.  He needs to pee every hour, he barks in the crate, I missed my son's last soccer game to ""watch the dog"",  we can't go on our beloved bike rides, we can't go to the beach, we can't go to the movies, we can't do anything as a family anymore.  I know he will get older and probably get easier, but in reality, when school starts in the fall, my sons and daughter will be in school, my husband and adult daughter will be at work, my 18 year old will be in college (commuting but still out a lot) and he has a job, and now that my kids are older and my life was simplified a little I will have to be home with this dog????   I can't believe I was this stupid.  I will be the one either worrying about leaving him, rushing home so he can pee, or staying home in a house basically run by a dog.  A dirty home that now has an ugly dog crate in the middle of my finally redecorated living room .  And if we put him outside, he just barks to come in where we are.  IF we dare to go outside to enjoy our yard, he barks at the door and we can't relax.  If we take him outside, we are just babysitting the whole time and chasing him and trying to stop him from doing bad things outside instead of inside.  And listening to him bark at the neighbors, or bark at something else.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is literally not one second's peace from it.  I never go out by myself, yet I went to a friend's house yesterday and wouldn't come home until he was asleep for the night.  Then I tiptoed back into MY OWN HOME after he was asleep in order not to wake him up and hear his barking again. I feel like a prisoner.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband loves dogs and always had a dog growing up and said once he is an adult he won't be much work.  But he doesn't understand AT ALL.  He gets to go to work, love his job, has ZERO responsibility with the dog, and never will.  When is isn't working, he is outside puttering around the yard in peace, takes a shower when he wants to, works out when he wants to, has his hobbies, etc.      I Am the one that has all the responsibility when my sons go back to school even though right now they are doing the walking, training, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done so much thinking over the past 2 weeks about why in the hell people ever thought it was a good idea to take an animal, put it in an unnatural environment for our own ""pleasure"", then subject ourselves to having to change our lives so much because now this innocent animal depends on us to feed it, give it water, and even to allow it to pee and poop.     It seems like the world has gone crazy.  When dogs were working for us/with us it was different.  They lived outside, had a job to do, had their own ""pack"".  Now we are their pack, and they want and need so much but unless we put them in a crate, leave them home all by themselves (whether in a crate or not), we cannot go about doing anything else in our lives

&amp;#x200B;

ANywhere I look for advice, the advice is insane.  Many many people have told me I need to tether the puppy to me all day long for months on end in order to train him.   No thank you....  

I have been told I need to spend MORE TIME with the dog, I need to hire a trainer, I need to spend $800 a month for dog walkers or puppy daycare, etc, if I want to go out and have a life.  It's insane.   I've also been told by professionals that I need to ""ignore"" the barking.    BUt we have tried that and not only is it ruining the quality of our lives, it is near impossible to ignore.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm at a crossroads.  My adult daughter, my 10 year old daughter, my husband and myself are all ok with finding another home for the puppy.  It is just not for us, and especially not the right time of our lives.  We want more freedom to live, not more responsibilities.  However, my 14 year old in particular would be devastated.  He has wanted a dog his whole life, wants to spend his life training dogs, and in truth this gift was more for him than anyone else.  I couldn't take any longer hearing his desperation for a dog and his unhappiness that he didn't have one.   I said no for years because I knew how hard it would be, but didn't really realize who incredibly ridiculous it would be when it was here.  Nothing can prepare you for it.  Saying to myself ""well my sons will take the dog out, train him, clean up the yard of dog poop"", was not reality.  

&amp;#x200B;

What in hell do I do now?   Break his heart?  Tell him the puppy has to go?  Wait it out , even though no matter how well behaved and calm the dog turns out to be I can't stand sharing my home with an animal that takes up your time, wants constant attention, needs so damn much money spent, restricts every fun thing you looked forward to doing both inside and outside your home?

  

How can I get my sons to accept that I'm not a bitch but the dog has to go?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow I  typed out a post and it disappeared so I&amp;#39;m trying this again.&lt;/p&gt;

Wait it out , even though no matter how well behaved and calm the dog turns out to be I can&amp;#39;t stand sharing my home with an animal that takes up your time, wants constant attention, needs so damn much money spent, restricts every fun thing you looked forward to doing both inside and outside your home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I get my sons to accept that I&amp;#39;m not a bitch but the dog has to go?&lt;/p&gt;

So as I said I work in a vet office because I adore animals, I have two cats of my own and they’re the best but sometimes work really drives me insane. 

We get all sorts of dogs come in, we get dogs that are calm as all hell and let you do whatever and we get dogs that are calm until you get them on the scale and then the dogs that are weird and skittish from the getgo. Whatever I’m trained in how to deal with all of the scenarios and we have a lot of safety precautions in place but HOLY FUCK THE OWNERS. 

People really don’t know ANYTHING about their dogs and it drives me insane. We’ve had people panic and call us and tell us the whole time how their dog won’t let us even weigh them and the dog sat calmly and let us clip their nails but the owner gave us anxiety and we would have all hands on deck for a dog that didn’t even need that shit, or people that tell me how sweet their dog is so I figure it will only take me and one other person to draw blood but jokes on us the dog freaks out and it takes three people to hold it down.

But the worst one was when I first started working there this woman that had a medium sized dog (she was a cattle dog mix) that was super people friendly, whatever. The appointment went great but we needed a fecal sample so we asked to owner to take her dog outside and get one for us if she could. She took her dog outside and we had another small dog that I had on a leash as I was talking to the owner. The owner of big dog stood outside for a few seconds before coming inside and her dog immediately lunged at the small dog I was handling at the time and bit her behind the neck before I managed to separate them and get the small dog in the back. It turns out the owner of the big dog knew that her dog was dog aggressive but was absolutely in denial about it and acted all shocked her dog did that. It made me so insanely mad because that shit makes US look bad as a clinic and someone or one of the dogs could have gotten seriously hurt.

It was stressful because it was a hot day and he was very nervous and afraid of being locked in a cage in a strange environment. I turned the AC on full blast in the car to make it as comfortable as possible for him, and while waiting for our turn, I tried to soothe him by talking to him and sticking my finger through the cage to touch him. He meowed a couple of times and tried to catch my finger with his claws, obviously being in distress, but not bothering the other pet owners who were also waiting, much.

In the other part of the room, behind a small counter, there were two middle-aged women with a golden retriever, who also seemed distressed, he barked quite often and very loudly. That was fine by me, obviously the dog was also quite afraid and big dogs bark louder than a cat. Some time later a man walked in with a smaller dog, it looked like a dachshund. As they come in, the bigger dog immediately started FREAKING OUT, constantly barking for several minutes straight, much louder, and tried to jump over the counter repeatedly to attack or at least get closer to the smaller dog. Literally jumping and struggling to escape the leash and the owner's control several times within a short time, while barking down the room. The dachshund also barked aggressively in response, but stayed at his place.

The two ladies were quite unbothered by this, talking to the dog quietly to calm him, but still kept chatting with each other light-heartedly the entire time, never looking at the other people in the room.

Perhaps I'm not chill enough or too socially considerate, but had that been my dog, the first thing I would've done after containing him is to say ""sorry"" to the other people in the room. Saying that he's obviously very stressed, he's normally peaceful and loveable, instead of barking like madness and trying to attack animals for just being there. I know vet visits are burdensome, but that would just be me, and perhaps that's one reason I'm not a dog owner, I hate bothering and annoying people.

   When I moved in with my dad and step mom my freshman year of high school, it was more along the lines of “We have two dogs, you have to take care of them when we’re not here.” Which is all the time. When the school year was still going, they left for work at 6 in the morning and got home at six in the evening, while I left for school at 7:30 and got home at 4.

   Now that I’m on summer vacation, it’s even worse. I’m home all day. I’m specifically not allowed to leave the house because I have to watch the dogs. They follow me around all day. They won’t “go outside” for me, though. They just poop and pee where ever they want. If you can even call it poop. The older of the two has... *issues*. It’s more like slime. It’s disgusting and I nearly throw up every time I have to clean it up. 

   I hate these dogs with every inch of my heart, and yet I am forced to be their primary caretakers. *I do not want them*. They are *disgusting*.  And now, I am trapped in a car with them for *fourteen hours*.  Every year, my parents and I go on vacation to Florida. And they insist on bringing their *dogs*. The first year, it was a five hour drive. The second year, nine. Now? Fourteen. 

   My job, as I sit in the backseat next to their dog bed, is to keep them out of the front seat. Which they are desperate to get to. I have to physically hold them back. I have to *touch* them. If it wasn’t clear before how disgusting they are, at the time of writing this, we’re half an hour into the drive and my hand already *stinks* from constantly pushing them away.

   They’re sitting right next to me and I *cannot stand* the smell. They keep trying to crawl all over me, too. And worst, is the whining. *They have not stopped whining since we left*. I am blaring my earbuds and probably going deaf and I can *still* hear it. It makes me so stressed and tense. Last time, they didn’t stop whining for *two hours*. I *cannot stand* these abominations.

   I have thirteen hours left, and I’m about ready to just open the door and jump out. It’d be worth it to get away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

First I want to thank everyone for being so supportive. Many have asked for an update so here it is. We filed to have the dog labeled as dangerous which results in an investigation. When my son was bit we were attending a graduation party at the home where the dog lives. Only a few people from the neighborhood were at the party and we were all in the same little circle talking so none of the neighborhood adults witnessed it firsthand (or at least nobody has admitted it to me yet or are willing to get involved). Most of the party goers were family/friends of the dog owners. So through the investigation they have produced ""witnesses"" that are claiming my son ""pulled on the collar"" and was told to stop and was being ""heavy handed"". Without having my own adult witnesses, just kids who claim my son was only walking by the dog, we are dead in the water. The investigation is now being dropped and the dog warden will not pursue the charges because we will lose. We could push and have our son testify but he would have to sit there and listen to people painting him out to be a criminal and say the dogs actions were justified. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are obviously devastated, as we know our son, and the things the witnesses are saying are just lies. My son is so sweet and gentle and would never be mean to a dog or pull on its collar. Its just not in his personality. I do have to say though, that even if he did pull on the collar it is amazing to me that this would mean the dog is justified. Why would a dog that is so temperamental be out at a party where any kid (there were little 3 and 4 year old's) could have touched it in the ""wrong"" way. Any why aren't the dog owners held responsible for that?

&amp;#x200B;

So we are now just trying to move past the incident and finding a solution to manage living in the same neighborhood with such awful people.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to original post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I want to thank everyone for being so supportive. Many have asked for an update so here it is. We filed to have the dog labeled as dangerous which results in an investigation. When my son was bit we were attending a graduation party at the home where the dog lives. Only a few people from the neighborhood were at the party and we were all in the same little circle talking so none of the neighborhood adults witnessed it firsthand (or at least nobody has admitted it to me yet or are willing to get involved). Most of the party goers were family/friends of the dog owners. So through the investigation they have produced &amp;quot;witnesses&amp;quot; that are claiming my son &amp;quot;pulled on the collar&amp;quot; and was told to stop and was being &amp;quot;heavy handed&amp;quot;. Without having my own adult witnesses, just kids who claim my son was only walking by the dog, we are dead in the water. The investigation is now being dropped and the dog warden will not pursue the charges because we will lose. We could push and have our son testify but he would have to sit there and listen to people painting him out to be a criminal and say the dogs actions were justified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are obviously devastated, as we know our son, and the things the witnesses are saying are just lies. My son is so sweet and gentle and would never be mean to a dog or pull on its collar. Its just not in his personality. I do have to say though, that even if he did pull on the collar it is amazing to me that this would mean the dog is justified. Why would a dog that is so temperamental be out at a party where any kid (there were little 3 and 4 year old&amp;#39;s) could have touched it in the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; way. Any why aren&amp;#39;t the dog owners held responsible for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are now just trying to move past the incident and finding a solution to manage living in the same neighborhood with such awful people.&lt;/p&gt;

As a kid, around 8, I had a dog I loved named Coda, he was a chocolate lab mix, he was hit by a car when we found him(He was a stray, around that time he was about a year old) and he had to have his hip replaced, 

Even a stray can be trained.

Ever since Coda, every experience I've had with dogs was less than desireable.

Coda was hyperactive but he responded well to commands and he was quite loyal. I also managed to teach him not to lunge at strangers. Since then, every dig I've seen has been loud, relatuvely destructive, and was prone to the aformentioned lunging. I also developed an allergy to dogs.

#Current adulthood

I believe all domestic animals can be good or bad with training and disipline, however, people seem to be trying less and less to try and train them and are instead defending their actions more and more. Dogs are considered family, and anyone opposed to them are now labeled monsters.

I had a roommate who, knowing I have allergies to dogs, got a dog on two seperate occassions. The second was the worse of the two. The second dog did not have a cage or a crate for night time or when we were leaving the house. My roommate didn't try to train him very much, and he was very destructive. He broke dishes and ate food on multiple occassions(for which I would be blamed), he urinated and deficated on the floor despite our attempts to train him to use training pads. Furthermore, she rarely took him outside and never took him for walks.

He kept hurting my kitten(who was less than a year old and weighed nothing), and my roommate never tried to teach him not to do it or to intervene. He would even bite and scratch me which set my allergies crazy. Every time we would leave and come home, or go to sleep at night, he would completely destroy the living room. He ripped chunks of fur out of our adult cats, too.

On top of all that, for the final month and a half of owning the dog, I slept on the couch in the living room since my roommate's family needed a place to go(long story). I am close to her family since they adopted me, so I gave them my room.

That month and a half was hell because EVERY NIGHT I had to smell dog faeces &amp; got jumped on by the dog for no apparent reason. Every morning I woke up with heavy breathing and various scratches due to contact with the dog 24/7. Eventually we got rid of that dog.

#The moral of the story

*Dogs, as a creature, are NOT always bad*

But there are bad dogs out there. Furthermore, dogs without proper training are nothing more than untrained animals and will behave as such. Defending the actions of an untrained animal is absurd. Furthermore, putting someone else's quality of life at risk because you wantva dog is *never a good or fair idea*.

r/dogfree is not about hating dogs, it's about sharing bad experiences we've all had with dogs or their owners, or about the crazy stuff dogs do that dognuts defend, or the lengths dognuts go for their dogs.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Childhood&lt;/h1&gt;

Yes, you need therapy:

- You find validation in an unwillingly dependent animal, purposefully bred to exhibit a literal mental disability that forces it to exhibit hyper-social behavior. In other words, it pretty much *has* to “like” you.
- Selective breeding has further led to dogs exhibiting facial expressions and eye contact — but *not* experiencing the corresponding human emotions — that trigger the same oxytocin release that humans get from interacting with each other, and in particular, with human children.

You’re literally Pavlovian trained by a *dog*. Give that animal what it wants, you get an oxytocin hit. All from an animal that was bred to cognitive disability by humans. 

If you find enjoyment in that, you’re either too near-sighted to recognize that the dog is engaged in empty mimicry of human emotions, or you’re too emotionally broken to care that what you’re experiencing is entirely devoid of mutual meaning.

Furthermore, dogs occupy the privileged niche afforded to human children by our own biological imperatives. While there’s nothing wrong with choosing to not have children, dogs have increasingly displaced children (by serving as an emotional replacement) in many people’s lives; for an amusing case study, just browse the top posts and comments of a particular subreddit devoted to being child-free.

If you can identify this ecological niche and relationship to humanity for what it is — parasitic — it obviously follows that the dog-obsessed would benefit far more from therapy, than from owning a dog.

Last week I was bit by their food aggressive dog. Minding my own business eating a sandwich, the only thing I had eaten all day, their dog bit my finger and even broke through skin. I went to the er for that, and they paid me a little extra that day.

Today, their year old chocolate lab was trying to play with the same dog that bit me, well. The dog is feeling aggressive today and started full on attacking the dog.

I was so afraid I would get bit again by their dog, that I chained the puppy to a tree because its barking constantly (this thing has barked for HOURS straight, it never stops.) to come back inside, and it broke off the leash and jumped ontop of me and tried to bite my face.

There is a difference between strongly disliking and hating. I HATE THIS DAMN DOG!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, me and my mom's boyfriend get along great. Sometimes he throws temper-tantrums like he's 6 years old and drinks alcohol like a fish- which can be incredibly annoying. I have to stay at their home over the summer because I'm moving out of the states in August for university so I have no choice but to be around this dog.

&amp;#x200B;

She is a german shepherd rottweiler mix- lazy and disgusting. She will lick herself until her fur falls off, she has no sickness of any sort. He took her to the vet and the vet said she didnt have any sickness mentally or physically (fungi or no diseases) she simply just licks herself. She has all these HUGE bald spots on her body and her hair continues to fall off. The entire floor is covered in HER hair. Not to mention she pisses on herself- AGAIN NO SICKNESS she just does it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She will piss where shes sitting and laying down, roll in it, then come towards me and shake the pee everywhere. Even though we feed her food she manages to shit and eat her shit. 

But the biggest irritation I have with her is when she licks her privates- LOUDLY. You can hear her slurping and licking...she does this even while shes peeing- will sit there and lick her privates while she pees and then come to me afterwards KNOWING I dont like her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I swear the dog KNOWS i dont like her because when my moms boyfriend is around she will do things that really irritate me and get close to me expecting me to pet her. As well as jump on the couch right next to me and roll around with her pee covered body.

&amp;#x200B;

My moms boyfriend NEVER trained or disciplined her so she basically does what ever the hell she wants. However, when he isnt around or even in the room- she wont do all of the things I just listed because she knows it will irritate the hell out of me. The only time she does these things is when he is at home. Thats it. 

Not to mention when my dog is around, my moms boyfriend's dog will try to attack her for no apparent reason. My dog will be sitting next to me, no barking, just sitting there minding her own business- then all of a sudden this dog will come, growl at her and try to bite her.

But there are other behaviors associated with this that don't seem to fit into that ideology. Whats really going on is people are beginning to act like dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

Dog owners seem to subconsciously adopt a mindless pack mentality where they are all about blind support for their animals and upholding a pack type pecking order in their lives. For example dog owners have this tendency to tell people their dogs are more important in their lives. Maintaining a hierarchy like this is daily life in a wild pack, but we can vocalize it. Much less frequent where a person would tell you their best friend, sibling or family member is more important to them than you are. That's because that pack mentality is simply not there. I believe being around dogs too much subconsciously imposes a pack mentality in weak minded people that look to dogs for things like company, support and protection. They socially elevate their dogs to human levels then subconsciously end up adopting to their dogs interests and behaviors. A mentality based around feelings of protection, inclusion, fear and aggression, just like wild dogs in a pack.

&amp;#x200B;

**This explains almost all dognutter behavior with a single explanation.**

&amp;#x200B;

The pack mentality causes a person to forgo basic hygiene practices in such a way that they would never treat another person like that even knowing that person is generally clean vs. a dog that has not been bathed in weeks. You unconditionally accept a member of your pack to then be unconditionally accepted by the pack. Think about the intimacy of grooming someone with your mouth, you are unconditionally accepting them at the most intimate level.

&amp;#x200B;

The pack mentality is what causes a person to take a dangerous animal around other people when they would never place another person in danger by other means. The pack must never be separated, always together for protection. The pack comes first no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

The pack mentality is what causes the need to tell people they rank lower than their dogs. Animal packs are all about the hierarchy and pecking order.

&amp;#x200B;

The pack mentality is what causes nutters to allow dirty animals on their beds and furniture, their home becomes a den. Dogs have a natural denning instinct that has to do with safety. A nutter is a member of the pack and must participate in all pack behavior. We use furniture like a den, so must the dog include the furniture as it's den space also. When you look at nutter furniture it often has a fabric cover thrown over it, that clearly means the person does not want dirty furniture. But the furniture ends up dirty anyways if a dog consistently rests on it. So nutters are subconsciously forced to do something they clearly do not want to do to support the subconscious pack denning instinct they are being subject to. Instead of just playing with their dogs on the floor, they must show solidarity with the pack and compromise their own interests to maintain the pack bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

The pack mentality is what causes nutters to keep their dogs off the leash. We all know it's dangerous for a dog to be loose. Not only to the people in the area but to the dog itself as they tend to run into traffic and do things like that. Walking together is a major bonding exercise for the pack, the first thing you do to get two dogs to like each other is muzzle them and take them for a walk together. A nutter will compromise the safety of their dog and everyone else to enhance the pack bonds. In cases like this the pack mentality actually places the dog in danger suggesting the importance of the pack even trumps the dogs safety.

“I received your complaint regarding dogs in the facility. I spoke with one of the Starbucks manager and according to her, their policy in accordance with the ADA law, employees can only ask the patrons if the dogs are service dogs. If the patrons answer yes, the employees cannot act any further. 

According to the ADA law on service dogs, employees of a food facility can only ask 2 questions:

1. Is your dog a service dog?
2. What is your dog trained to do?

It is unlawful to ask for anything else or to request documentation. Also, service dogs are not required to have identification.”

“Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to reply to my complaint. I am familiar with limitations the ADA law places on food facility employees, but it upset me that none of the employees even asked one of the two questions that they are allowed to ask.

I strongly believe that most of the dogs people bring with them into food facilities are neither service animals nor emotional support animals.  This pro-dog craze has been getting worse and worse over the years. Their owners are acting in an entitled and selfish way at the expense of food safety, facility cleanliness and the customers’ health. 

These laws are lax and vague and too many people take advantage of it. I’m just really worried that some bad incident will eventually take place because it. And even then, probably nothing will change because apparently public health isn’t as important as dog owners’ “right” to impose their pets onto others. 

I hope my complaint will somehow be a step in the direction of positive change, change that will benefit the public’s health. It’s very frustrating that the health department seems just as shackled by these lax ADA laws as the food facilities. Such a shame.”

Should I call animal control? Are there ordinances against pitbull mixes in IL or is that a city ordinance thing?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I call animal control? Are there ordinances against pitbull mixes in IL or is that a city ordinance thing? I don&amp;#39;t want the neighbors to know that I called and complained, because they&amp;#39;re as welcoming as their hell hound. Seriously, I have never seen a dog that huge and I&amp;#39;m used to big dogs. This thing looks like he&amp;#39;s the offspring of Cerberus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to like dogs. Now I can&amp;#39;t stand them, particularly the huge ones. Other than walking past Shady House, anything I can do to keep relatively safe?&lt;/p&gt;

So as I have gotten older, my affection for dogs (and lots of other animals, kids, and adults...but specifically dogs) has significantly decreased. I'm not sure if this is because of obnoxious dog nutter 'pet parents' (barf!) or because I just have very little patience for how annoying they can be. Actually, I take some of that back. It's probably because over the years I've experienced incidents with/related to dogs which were negative that I have a significantly lower tolerance for them.

My mother (who has an annoying as shit, possible mildly mentally retarded, mini Australian shepherd), says to me a while back ""But you used to love dogs as a kid!"". Yeah, back before the aforementioned laundry list of negative experiences and the decreased patience for BS that often accompanies adulthood.

I accept my dog because she is extremely low maintenance, cheap to look after, and is generally very well-behaved. If she wasn't, I would boot her down to the pound without a second thought. I'm 100% her owner, NOT her ""parent"". I have real kids, thankyouverymuch. It would be degrading to them to call an animal their sibling.

BONUS: Recently I took over a side gig dog-sitting from a friend, more as a way to make extra cash.

My son is scared to death at this point. I have reported the incident to the state, just waiting for things to happen. Not really looking for advice here just really to vent. Also, for anyone here that was bitten as a kid, how did it affect you? We have 2 dogs ourselves that are so sweet and my son loves them, but it has caused some confusion and he is very fearful of other dogs.

After a month and a half of having the dog, my friend tells me a story that she was walking her dog around her apt. Complex and she saw a chihuahua. Chihuahua died aftwr being mauled but the family didnt speak a word of English and no charges filed. No retribution. So now, this dog has at least 2 kills and a child bite to its name. ""But shes such a sweet safe cute dog!""

It should be illegal for stupid people to adopt dogs that are more than half their body weight. She certainly cant stop her dog mid attack. 
And what is my friends resolution to the dog attack? ""We just have to be more careful with her. She gets too excited"". Literally what the fuck. 
For months after that (6 months) this fucking idiot does NOT even consider a muzzle. 
""Like i might consider one of those bandanas, but the metal ones definitely not. No, like people will be scared of her and it will be degrading""

Uhh yea, people should be scared of her. Shes killed things, and you arent taking ANY precautionary steps (other than checking if anybody is in the dog park before she is taken out). And she actually said that degrading/hulimiating line. THEN DONT GET A FUCKINF ATTACK DOG IF YOU ARENT WILLING TO TRAIN OR MUZZLE IT YOU FUCKING IDIOT. 

I swear, shes one of the most self focused individuals ive ever met, and shes comvinced that her life is this woodstock/hangout sesh where everyone loves everyone and nothing bad could ever happen. Meanwhile if we left her dog u leashed in a room with a 5 year old, it would actually maul the kid to death. Obviously, I have more problems with her than just the dog, but its more that this is the epitome of the type of decision she would make. Unthoughtout, spontanious, self centered decision making and nor concerning herself with the opinions of the people she lives with. Her brother takes care of her at least half the time.

The dog is overwhelmingly sweet/needy. Like constantly griping for your attention. Head in crotch, licks you anywhere it wants to, has zero concept of personal space, etc. My friend gives into it and loves the stinky p.o.s to cuddle in bed and on the couch. It jumps up and digs its claws into my feet/thighs. It has these big black eyes that are so dead set on making their owner love them, it literally makes me wanna vomit. I kick it out of the bedroom, and it acts like ive done it a great disrespect. Fuck dogs in general, but fuck this dog especially.

Thats where the concept of a dog is really off on me. Why would you want a companion that is that submissive to you, but so outwardly aggressive to anyhing else? Youre literally trading a social life and actual friends for a baby killer. Its fuckin pathetic.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its the cliche story, my good friend moved across the country with her brother. When they got there, she didnt really consult her brother and got a rescue dog. 8 year old pit mix with a lot of baggage. Shelter was vague, but is open about her outward aggressiveness to literally ANY other dog and SMALL CHILDREN. But all my friend hears is &amp;quot;shes been neglected. She needs a loving owner who can see past her history&amp;quot;. And god forbid the shelter actually put down a dog that has mauled other dogs and has harmed children.&lt;/p&gt;

But of course that don’t apply to dog nutters, they still snuck their mutt in.

I was doing a Dressage test on an experienced mare who doesn’t care for dogs luckily for me. Since right in the middle of my test this loose dog gets into the arena and starts running towards me and my horse barking away it’s tongue hanging out. This dog I recognised as a Puli, ridiculous mop looking thing.

I pulled my horse to a halt and just started at it. My mare stood their calmly not even reacting to walking barking mop.

Show stewards came in to the arena to drag the dog off when nutter owner turns up.

“Aww he just wants to play. He loves horses.”

Me pissed off had to be a sarcastic asshole and replied “Loves horses does he? And how does he love them? Rare, medium or well done?”.

At this point show security arrived to remove nutter and her mutt. Nutter was surprised not everyone wanted to drop what they were doing and pat their dog.

They did get thrown out, dog nutter didn’t even have a horse entered or know anyone competing. She just decided to bring her mutt.’

This dog has been running up behind horses just minding their own business, dug a hole in the show jumping ring, pissed all over peoples expensive horse trailers.

Oh and her mutt left a giant crap in the middle of the Dressage arena, she didn’t clean it up of course.

If that mutt got kicked no doubt nutter would of had a fit and blamed the horse. Kinda wish a horse did teach that dog a lesson.

Maybe a hefty vet bill would teach the nutter not to bring their dog somewhere they don’t belong.

Ps: Because I was interrupted they allowed me to redo my test at the end. However I finished out of the placings. Oh well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the fliers, on the entry forms, on the front gate to get into the grounds it clearly stated.&lt;/p&gt;

I apologize for the length in advance. 

My roommate decided to get a puppy from a random box at Wal-Mart and bring it home without consulting my other roommate or I prior.

I was definitely annoyed because I haven't had the greatest of experiences with dogs previously and my cat hates them but I didn't hate them at the time and I assumed he would properly train her, but I was horribly wrong.

Pretty much everyday for almost 8 months this dog would shit, piss, and bark constantly in the house because he would leave for hours and hours during the night and never let her out and I would wake up for work and have to go out the back door to avoid all of it. He also wouldn't clean it up right away and it would just shit there for additional hours.

When he did take her out during the day. He would never ever pick up the dog shit in the yard either despite me asking repeatedly, and I would have to go and pick it all up at least once a month to avoid my guests or I from stepping in it because it was everywhere.

I would also have to lock my cat in my tiny bedroom to avoid her being attacked and to avoid having all of her food being eaten every day.

The dog also ripped huge holes in every piece of furniture I had in the living room and never gave me any compensation for any of it, and she would tear up all the trash and massacre the bathroom at least a few times a week.

He would also beat the dog when she would do all of this, even though it is obviously his fault. We had animal control called on us 3 times and the cops called twice. He used to leave her in a tiny cage in the yard during the winter with no food or water. Animal control literally looked up my license plate and called me at work about it, it was embarrassing.

Our landlord ended up only giving us half our deposit back because of all the damage this dog had done and the worst part is that he moved into a house now that doesn't allow pets, so he gave her away, and everything we went through was a waste.

I was in the middle of getting a Master's degree and this stressed me out to no end. I felt more relieved to be at work than I did in my own house. It was one of the worst experiences of my life and I will never allow a dog in my house ever again.

It's a new development, only in the last 3-4 weeks. Hands down the worst deliveries to make are to people with dogs.

Outside dogs (as in dogs in the backyard) scare me because I'm incredibly paranoid that they'll jump their fence and attack me before their owners answer the door.

&amp;#x200B;

But inside dogs are so, so, so much worse for so many reasons. And a lot of the times it's not even the dogs themselves that are bad. It's their owners lack of consideration for other people that usually bleeds into other aspects of life beyond pet ownership.

A prime example of this from yesterday:

I make a giant ass delivery to a woman. I walk up with her groceries and knock on the door. She knew I was coming. She gets notifications when I check out. When I leave. She sees me on her map. She sees me outside her freaking house. And yet, she waits until I knock to put her dumb ass dogs away. I hear them barking like crazy and scratching at the door. I hear her come down the steps. I hear her shout ""Hold on just a second! I'm here, i just have to get the dogs.""

So I'm standing in front of her door with an ass-ton of heavy groceries, waiting for her to control her animals. She opens the door and immediately, her tiny little Pomeranian darts out to towards me.

&amp;#x200B;

The dog is fine. It has a good sense of personal boundaries; never gets closer to me than a couple of feet. But naturally, when it comes towards me, I back up a smidge because I'M STILL HOLDING HER FUCKING GROCERIES and if it's yappy or nippy like a lot of small dogs, I don't have hands free to get rid of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The lady DIES laughing and says ""Oh, don't worry! She just wants to say hi!!!"" then BENDS DOWN TO PET HER DOG AND LET IT LICK HER.

&amp;#x200B;

I am STILL holding her groceries.

She picks the dog up and puts it back inside and finally takes the bags from me. I walk back to my car to get her second load, which she doesn't offer to help with, and when she opens the door again, the tiny dog pops back out. Her larger dog is actually contained and is barking like crazy, which makes me antsy so I just want to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

But the tiny dog wants to come with me. Again, the dog is fine. It's a small, non-aggressive dog with good personal space. It's just following me, like dogs do. And the lady is standing in her doorway, laughing her ass off, watching this dog follow me to my car.

I get about a foot away from the street and turn around because I don't want the dog to go in the street and I am apparently the only one with a brain in this situation. I make it about halfway back into her yard when this lady FINALLY walks out of her house and calls for the dog.

But the dog keeps following me because it apparently knows it's owner is a moron, too, and it's trying to jump ship. Very understandable. I need to fucking go, though, because I AM WORKING and this is taking way too fucking long, so I just go ahead and get in my car now that the lady is at least trying to get the dog.

I then am forced to sit in my car for three full minutes (I know that doesn't sound like long, but it truly is) while the dog circles my car and the lady laughs hysterically in her yard while she half-asses calling for it and following it around. And this whole time, she's trying to catch my eye, and making little comments about how silly/cute this is, waiting for me to laugh, too. But I won't because it's not fucking funny.

I can't drive off bc I'm not a psycho and I'm not going to hit this dog, who I'm actually starting to feel bad for because her owner (who is high as a fucking kite, btw. House reeks of weed and she blows smoke directly in my face when she opens the door. Rude and stupid, considering weed is illegal in my state) is clearly incompetent.

The dog eventually resigns itself to its shitty life and gets out of the street and I leave.

After taking my cat to the vet, we stopped by my grandmas house to help her bathe and catch up. I was alone in the patio with the cat on my lap and when the dog saw my cat just chilling there it was chaos, it was like a completely different animal... she ran straight to us barking and biting like a fucking demon and nothing would snap her out of it, it was scary as fuck and nobody was coming to help, i was legit scared that dog would bite and push me over to get to my cat.My cat climbed a fence and almost ran away, but luckily i had her on a leash and could hold her.I still have the scars on my arms from when she clinged on to me and i blame myself for it all but holy fuck, i dont trust any dog anymore no matter how well trained.




The dog came back to normal after we left but i cant see her as the same, im just waiting for her to snap like that again. At least theres no more small children living there, but i worry about children and other pets around any dog now, and personally dont wish to be near any dog. Even if i didnt exactly like dogs before, i could understand why people kept them as pets even if theyre extremely dirty animals, but now i just question why anyone would keep an animal stronger then they are and that could snap and maul you at any moment.

Not only does she allow her shit beasts to jump on us and scratch our legs and arms when we walk into her house, but they also piss and shit all over her carpets on a daily basis. Absolutely disgusting.

However, that is not the reason for my first post tonight. I actually came across a dog owner who genuinely thought it was her dog's right to come through my house and onto my deck!

Earlier this evening I was making dinner while my cats were outside in their catio area. Suddenly I hear a loud rumble that sounded like tree branches being thrown down my back steps (it was long dog nails, eww). The cat's cage rumbled as my kitties clambered to the top perch of their enclosure to find safety. I look out the screen door and I'm face-to-face with a *huge* apparently labradoodle standing on my deck. Those dogs are TALL and big as shit up close, but I was panicked and undeterred. I flung open the door and told him to GO HOME. I glanced at the cats, whose hair was all on end and they were hissing, as they're completely terrified. I start toward the steps where the dog obviously came in from...and by the way, the only access to those steps is through my open garage door (it was only left open because my daughter had just went for a quick bike ride before dinner).
Luckily this mega monster started bounding toward the steps and followed me back into the garage, where I find the owner standing. Yes, *inside my garage.* As if!!!

I repeated to the dog, 'go home' and pointed towards the woman, figuring she would, like...do something about this situation. She nonchalantly said he was just looking for my neighbor's dog, ""his friend."" Eye roll. I told her, "" I don't know my neighbor's dog but this one just showed up on my back deck out of nowhere and scared my cats pretty bad!"" I started backing away, now that I assumed this stranger and this is strange dog would politely get out of my garage and be on their way. But no, she thought I needed a friendly explanation. Which I did not. I really just wanted to check on my cats and hoped to send the signal that them being in my garage was NOT OKAY, but I paused because I thought a quick apology was coming. Wrong. 

""You know Bailey? He lives over there?"" Pointing aimlessly somewhere towards outside. ""He's a labradoodle too."" I told her no, I did not know Bailey or any of the dogs on my block and I'd like to shut the main garage door now so I can go check on my cats. I reminded her that they were really freaked out and I too, was pretty startled to find a huge dog standing at my patio door. This is, again, a private deck which you only have access to through the back garage door via the stairs around the back of our house. And turns out she *instructed her dog to come through there.* Wtf

She continued, ""Well, I told him to go find Bailey and I saw Bailey take off this way so he came to find Bailey. Didn't you? You were looking for Bailey? He just lives right there. Don't you know him?"" 

""Okay, well no I don't know any dogs and if you don't mind stepping out of the garage, I'm shutting it now""  I told her again. 

I swear she thought I was going to praise her gOoD bOi for being so diligently intrusive coming into my private property or something... I mean, seriously not a single quick 'sorry about that' nor did she ever make any motion to have the dog come toward her. As soon as she was cleared of the sensor, I pressed the close button and cut her off.

The dog did not hurt me or my cats, but it was also without a leash. The audacity of this lady continuing to stand in my garage and ramble about how her giving her dog these instructions might be acceptable, was just beyond belief. 

No, people don't want a large (or small) dog coming through their garage/house and showing up on their back deck unannounced! I'm not going to pet him, compliment him or anything of the sort. Your dog doesn't get a cookie and I don't care who Bailey is.

I am the opposite of a dog lover. After raising a dog for 3 years (who is now with a dog lover) I knew I never wanted to deal with a house dog again. But I figured that the dogs would be upstairs with the owner or outside in the yard most of the time while I'd be downstairs. There is a locked door that separates the two floors. It was a good price in an excellent neighborhood. The dogs were pretty well-behaved the first several months of living here so we coexisted peacefully.

Until now.

This weekend my housemate goes on vacation. The same day she leaves I'm in our shared bathroom and notice a really bad smell. I look down to find diarrhea/poop on the floor. Some was smeared so I looked at the bottom of my slippers and sure enough, I'd stepped in it. 

I was a little pissed. I had to clean up and disinfect the bathroom, not to mention my slippers. Having to clean up after a dog that I didn't choose to have was pretty annoying. 

But that wasn't all.

This morning I wake up to take a shower and what do I find in the hallway? You guessed it. More diarrhea. A lot more. And vomit. In at least 6 or 7 different spots. And the dog had trekked through it so there were poopy paw prints all around. The smell was absolutely revolting. And then I open the door to find the poop-covered dog sleeping in the bathroom. So now I had to clean up the bathroom (again!) because it left poop where it had laid.

I noticed the dog responsible for the mess stayed farrrr away from it. It had pooped by a blanket set out for it so what did it do? Find another spot to sleep and hang out! Oh, the irony!

I called the owner on vacation because I refuse to clean up the rest of the diarrhea and vomit. But I let the dogs out as I'd agreed to. I let them back in after 30 minutes and went to tend to some stuff outside. I come back in to find one of the dogs had jumped on the owner's bed (dogs are forbidden on any furniture). I chased the dog off and closed the door so it wouldn't go back in the room.

I headed downstairs to my room and in my living area I noticed the smell of dog. I lock my door when I leave so the dogs have never been in my room. However, I now come into the room and to my HORROR I find the other dog laying on my pillows looking up at me. I chase this one off and immediately take off the sheets to put them in the wash. There is a huge wet spot from something, drool or urine, on the pillowcases. I don't know what it is but I now consider the sheets trash. The idea of putting my head down where a poop-covered, germ-carrying animal butt has been is not acceptable. I had to get out a whole new, unused set to replace the one this massive dog decided to make its bed.

I've now decided to move. It will be a long process but I can't do this. I don't know if these dogs have separation anxiety or what but I refuse to live like this. I chose not to have dogs so I wouldn't have to deal with this disgusting stuff or the never-ending responsibility of a dog, period. I'm not going through this with someone else's dogs.

Thank you for letting me vent.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against my better judgment I agreed to move into a home with two large dogs. I am the opposite of a dog lover. After raising a dog for 3 years (who is now with a dog lover) I knew I never wanted to deal with a house dog again. But I figured that the dogs would be upstairs with the owner or outside in the yard most of the time while I&amp;#39;d be downstairs. There is a locked door that separates the two floors. It was a good price in an excellent neighborhood. The dogs were pretty well-behaved the first several months of living here so we coexisted peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend my housemate goes on vacation. The same day she leaves I&amp;#39;m in our shared bathroom and notice a really bad smell. I look down to find diarrhea/poop on the floor. Some was smeared so I looked at the bottom of my slippers and sure enough, I&amp;#39;d stepped in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little pissed. I had to clean up and disinfect the bathroom, not to mention my slippers. Having to clean up after a dog that I didn&amp;#39;t choose to have was pretty annoying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that wasn&amp;#39;t all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I wake up to take a shower and what do I find in the hallway? You guessed it. More diarrhea. A lot more. And vomit. In at least 6 or 7 different spots. And the dog had trekked through it so there were poopy paw prints all around. The smell was absolutely revolting. And then I open the door to find the poop-covered dog sleeping in the bathroom. So now I had to clean up the bathroom (again!) because it left poop where it had laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed the dog responsible for the mess stayed farrrr away from it. It had pooped by a blanket set out for it so what did it do? Find another spot to sleep and hang out! Oh, the irony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the owner on vacation because I refuse to clean up the rest of the diarrhea and vomit. But I let the dogs out as I&amp;#39;d agreed to. I let them back in after 30 minutes and went to tend to some stuff outside. I come back in to find one of the dogs had jumped on the owner&amp;#39;s bed (dogs are forbidden on any furniture). I chased the dog off and closed the door so it wouldn&amp;#39;t go back in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

My dislike started as a kid and I won't give the backstory because it sounds pretty much similar to many of you. I just want to share my own experience with a dog nutter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a private duty nurse. I work overnight shifts in the homes of children and young adults with chronic illnesses who need skilled nursing.  I worked for about 4 years with this one family, a beautiful, smart teenage girl with a muscle disease who used a wheelchair.   I worked 4-5 nights a week with her at one point, for 12 hours a day. I got in at 9p and left at 9a.  Anyway, I felt like a trusted almost-family member, I had a solid, wonderful rapport with this client, the family was thrilled they had a solid, reliable nurse that fit in so well w them.  In her sophomore year of college, she took a gap semester off. 

&amp;#x200B;

During that time, her family got her a teacup maltese puppy.  It was yappy, aggressive, chewed everything, needed tons of socialization and play, went on a wee-wee pad (the family didn't let her go outside on their well-manicured lawn) and because this girl was unable to do ANY of its care, the job of doing everything for this beast fell to me. (In home nursing, the nurse takes on the role of home health aide too, and is expected to do light housekeeping and assist with tasks the client would normally do if able-bodied)   In reality, the family was pushing that limit, but since the dog stayed in the client's suite (the house was huge and had it's own cottage attached to the larger home) they just assumed their daughter's nursing staff would naturally do all the dog's care. So I would play with this stupid dog for hours, because my client enjoyed watching.  She literally could not play with this dog, so it was like, ""Throw the tennis ball, play catch with her. Oh, now play tug of war. Now do the squeeky toy with her."" If she wanted the dog in her lap, I'd have to stay close by and ""spot"" this dog so she didn't leap out of her lap and hurt herself. I'd feed the dog, pick up it's tiny poo on the pad, crate it at night and when it cried and the client woke, I'd have to get this dog out and take it to her, again, spotting this dog so she didn't fall off the bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

This already had ruined the job for me (which was a dream job for 4 years) until the day I came in and the dog just got back from the vet from being spayed. GET THIS: they expected me to perform the post-operative care. Give the pain med overnight, take off the cone of shame to let her eat BUT- and this was the absolute deal breaker- the mom told me to ""be careful when you take the cone off and make sure she doesn't bite her stitches out.""  That was the last straw. What was I supposed to do to prevent THAT???  I told the family I was not comfortable doing post op care on this dog.  So the client's younger teen sister did the feeding/cone thing that night. THEN...

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call the next day from my agency saying this family is requesting another nurse for the rest of the time this dog's stitches are in. This happened 3 days before CHRISTMAS. And I was scheduled over 50 hours that week. I was reassigned to other clients, but I still lost many hours, I ended up losing several hundred dollars that week from this family ""suspending"" me for not cooperating with their unrealistic expectations.  My agency was not upset with me, they knew it was an abuse, they did tell the family that this is not what their nurses are for, but they did get some other nurses in that week that didn't mind taking that risk. (The agency of course wouldn't want to lose all that money if they had willing nurses.)   After my ""suspension"", I went back, but things were never the same. I was so hurt that this family who always told me how they loved me and how lucky they were to have me was able to cast me off like that, because I wouldn't play vet tech for them. I worked out the rest of the semester this girl was home but I remained cold and distant.  When she went back to college, I refused to work for her any more during her summers and breaks.

(The agency of course wouldn&amp;#39;t want to lose all that money if they had willing nurses.)   After my &amp;quot;suspension&amp;quot;, I went back, but things were never the same. I was so hurt that this family who always told me how they loved me and how lucky they were to have me was able to cast me off like that, because I wouldn&amp;#39;t play vet tech for them. I worked out the rest of the semester this girl was home but I remained cold and distant.  When she went back to college, I refused to work for her any more during her summers and breaks.  A fantastic job and friendship ruined by a yappy little shitbeast.&lt;/p&gt;

I react just being in an enclosed space with a dog, and I break out into hives immediately if a dog touches me. I also have anxiety, that's been much worse since my dog allergy got so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to plan a relaxing day for myself yesterday, I work, and I'm the mom of a toddler so I rarely get time for myself to do something relaxing. I planned something for myself and my toddler in the morning, and then a relaxing spa afternoon with a lady friend. Well, the thing I planned to do with my toddler was at a local park. Wouldn't you know that the kids thing and the DOG PARK were right next to each other, and shared a parking lot. There were multiple dogs in the parking lot when I was getting out of my car, and then two huge, barely restrained dogs right in our path, barking and snarling at each other. I also carried my kid from the car all the way into the park. Honestly if it had been something I was just doing for myself I would have left, but for my kid I was able to push through and luckily no dogs made contact with us. Still, by the time I got to the kids activity, I was hyperventilating and shaking from head to toe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, in the afternoon, I get to this fancy spa, we check in, and go to the waiting area. 5 minutes later, some idiot arrives WITH THEIR DOG. I just can't make this stuff up. Luckily the dog was far enough away from me I did not react, and my friend went over and explained to them that if the dog was coming anywhere near where our services were being done, we would need to leave because of my severe allergy. Turns out the person with the dog ""just stopped in to say hi"" so they left.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, it was really upsetting. I might do something relaxing like visit a spa...honestly not even once a year. I've been under a ton of stress lately so I wanted to treat myself to something relaxing. I did enjoy myself, but it took awhile to calm down after the dog left.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the afternoon, I get to this fancy spa, we check in, and go to the waiting area. 5 minutes later, some idiot arrives WITH THEIR DOG. I just can&amp;#39;t make this stuff up. Luckily the dog was far enough away from me I did not react, and my friend went over and explained to them that if the dog was coming anywhere near where our services were being done, we would need to leave because of my severe allergy. Turns out the person with the dog &amp;quot;just stopped in to say hi&amp;quot; so they left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it was really upsetting. I might do something relaxing like visit a spa...honestly not even once a year. I&amp;#39;ve been under a ton of stress lately so I wanted to treat myself to something relaxing. I did enjoy myself, but it took awhile to calm down after the dog left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for letting me rant, redditors of dog free. And thank you all for actually caring about allergic individuals!&lt;/p&gt;

we were there for a good 35 \~ mins when the this woman came, me and my girlfriend both kind of hate dogs for their smell and how aggressive they are. so we see this women walking towards us with 4 pitbulls, 2 of which are unleashed. 

I was extremely fot I have been attacked by pits when I was younger. so as she apporoched us she didnt say a word and one of the pits ran forward and charged at the bench I was sitting on, then the other one that was unleashed charge at us too (the other friend gone home by then) so I didnt really know what was happening so when they got close I kicked one of them right when it was goiong jump on me, and the second one was kicked by my friend as well.

Right when that happended the women(mid 40s ish? ) came running towards us WITH THE OTHER TWO PITS

we basiclly tried to talk to her from afar and tried to tell her to not get closes to us, but she started screaming about how we are dog eaters? (maybe becuase my girlfriend is asian) but I didnt really respond with anything but she started charging at us with the pits again. 

I ended up kicking  one of he dogs that was infront and after that she kind of back away

and she started crying about how we where bullying and attack her dogs and how we would go to jail for this, I ended up reporting her to the police and for unleasg dog are illegal in my area and pitbull were completely illegal he was find for a lot and her dogs (which are fine) were taken from her.

I was thinking, given our membership size in this sub, we could (as comfortable as people are willing to share information) make a list of cities/neighborhoods and maybe have like a dogfree rating of 1-5 (1 = minimal or unnoticeable, 5 = like living in a hell kennel) with how bad the nuttery is in that particular place, so over time, we can develop a great tool for anyone looking to move to a more dogfree friendly area. Maybe just a filterable Excel spreadsheet of city, state/province (or other similar district), country, and if people wanted, individual neighborhoods or towns within a city (especially for large ones like Chicago or NYC). Perhaps also links to those cities' municipal codes pertaining to noise complaints, animal control, etc. that many of our members might find useful?

I wouldn't mind starting it, but would definitely need help in what would be most useful for us and some of the specifics, especially regarding places I haven't lived before.

I moved my kids to the side, and put my body between them and the dog. She said &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; as she passed. Apparently aware that her dog was dangerous. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone says it's just puppy blues, it'll end soon and it's ""so rewarding"". Ugh. It takes so long for it to grow up and it'll still be stuck in toddler mode forever until it gets too old to move in a decade.

I don't hate this dog - but I'm not crazy about having it come with us every time. I texted my friend - told her I wanted to go for a 'hike,' which means in the woods.

Me: I'll pick you up!  
Friend: Your car is too small for the dog. Can we just walk in the neighborhood?  
Me: I really want to go in the woods - after sitting in an office 50 hours a week, I'd like a little nature.  
Friend: Oh - I re-read your original text that said hike. I'll walk the dog after we get back. It's ok that we just go  
on the hike.

So we start hiking.  
Friend: ""I feel so guilty being here without DOGGO. He just loves to run in the woods.

We've all heard this shit before.  But when it comes to responsibilities, accountability, and consequences that any human would face if they did what a dog did, this argument is nowhere to be found.


If a dog barks all night, you could call animal control or the police and they will do nothing.  But if a human was making an obnoxious amount of noise at 2AM, you better believe they would get fined and if they kept doing it they would eventually get arrested for disturbing the peace.


Dog lovers always say we have to avoid triggering dogs.  Don't walk too fast, don't walk too slow, don't look them in the eye, don't get too low to the ground, don't make sudden movements, don't make any loud noises...  If a human had that many triggers nobody would be saying we should walk on eggshells for them and if those triggers made them violent they would just end up in prison and nobody would feel sorry for them.


Dogs run up to people and hump their legs, that's rape or at least sexual assault if a person did it.


Dogs piss everywhere in public, a human would get arrested for that.


If a human ripped a child's arm off and ate it, he would be seen as a monster and undoubtedly get a life sentence or close enough to it.  But when dogs did it in Layton did it, a petition to save the dogs got over 250,000 signatures and the dogs were just put up for adoption and given a new loving home where they will live out their days consequence free.


So ultimately dog lovers don't want dogs to be treated like people.  They want dogs to be allowed anywhere humans are and have the privileges of a human, but also want them completely exempt from the law, responsibility, societal expectations, accountability or punishment.  They are entitled to free food, shelter, healthcare, love, attention etc. for their entire lives and they pay us back by barking incessantly, attacking people (often children) unprovoked, and generally degrading the quality of our lives.


Has there ever been a group of humans, anywhere in the world, that have enjoyed *this* much privilege while contributing absolutely nothing and actively degrading the quality of everyone else's life?  Not even members of royalty were completely exempt from responsibilities, accountability and legal consequences.  Maybe a few dictators or kings had this kind of privilege, but if a king acted anywhere near as retarded as dogs do, they would either be assassinated or there would be a revolt.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devocalizing muh doggos is cruel!  Would you devocalize loud people?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should we muzzle dogs, would you muzzle a child!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apartment doesn&amp;#39;t allow dogs?  how about we ban hoomans instead?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You think pibbles and rotties are more likely to be violent based on bite and fatality statistics?  That&amp;#39;s no different from racism!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all heard this shit before.  But when it comes to responsibilities, accountability, and consequences that any human would face if they did what a dog did, this argument is nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a dog barks all night, you could call animal control or the police and they will do nothing.  But if a human was making an obnoxious amount of noise at 2AM, you better believe they would get fined and if they kept doing it they would eventually get arrested for disturbing the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog lovers always say we have to avoid triggering dogs.  Don&amp;#39;t walk too fast, don&amp;#39;t walk too slow, don&amp;#39;t look them in the eye, don&amp;#39;t get too low to the ground, don&amp;#39;t make sudden movements, don&amp;#39;t make any loud noises...  If a human had that many triggers nobody would be saying we should walk on eggshells for them and if those triggers made them violent they would just end up in prison and nobody would feel sorry for them.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was about 7 years old, I was at the neighboorhood park with my younger sister (about 5 or 6 at the time). We were sitting in the grass playing with our beanie babies, when some lady walked into the park with her Rottweiler. The Rottweiler launched at my sister, practically knocking her out, and started mauling her. I was just frozen in shock because it happened so fast. The owner pulled her dog off in a panic, and looked at my sister who was now bloody on the ground--and started yelling at her. In retrospect, I think the owner knew what would happen to her dog if anyone knew, so maybe her gut instinct was to make my sister think it was her fault? Nonetheless, instead of calling an ambulance, after cursing my sister out, she bolted from the park with her dog. I had to help lug my half-conscious sister back to the house, so my parents could take her to the hospital.   


Even after that, I guess I somewhat thought this had to be an isolated issue because it was so traumatic--until I got older. I ended up working in a clerical position at a vet clinic. I had a fear of dogs then, mostly a flinch response to random barking, but my dog-loving friends convinced me that I would have to expose myself to them to get over my fear--so, thinking something was horribly wrong with me, I took their advice. But it got only worse from there. You hear a lot of conversations when you work a clerical job. I heard a woman say, ""Yeah, if that asshole kid comes into my yard again. I'm gonna have Max rip their face off,"" patting her bullmastiff on the shoulder. And these kinds of conversations were commonplace. Even more so, I would hear so much empathy for dogs that had to be put down for attacking or killing children. I was always expected to nod my head and agree, but it horrified me that so many people thought this way.   


Now that I'm past all of that, I have developed a very strong phobia of dogs and distrust of dog owners. And just from talking to people and being on forums that fall into this discussion--I've seen a trend. People don't allow others to have their fears (unless it's a fear they approve of). Instead, people would say ""you need exposure,"" or ""the thing you fear is great, get over it"" or ""let me explain why you should love the thing you fear."" I see it all as a form of victim blaming, and even abuse in some cases. And I haven't encountered this worse anywhere than the dog community (although it isn't limited to the dog community).

Across the street from me is another mid-rise condo type building, and on the second floor directly across the street from me, I've been hearing a yapping dog barking incessantly all day. I work from home, so I hear it barking from about mid-morning until 6-7pm at night. I live on a very quiet street with trees, birds singing, etc...and the entire peaceful atmosphere of the street is ruined by this shit beast's noise making.

At first, I tried to call animal control, but their phone number doesn't even accept calls. (Recorded message only unless it's an ""emergency""). Then I did some research and contacted the property manager of the building. I sent him video/photo of the barking (I was able to get a blurry image of the dog peeking out of the window). He said he would ""look into it"" but weeks go by, and nothing happens. Dog continues to bark incessantly.

Finally, I decided to try Nextdoor. It took me forever to sign up/get verified (the postcard system is a little weird, my code didn't work, etc) but finally they verified me so I ended up posting about it. I also uploaded the photo/video of the dog and mentioned if anyone had info about this owner and had similar complaints, to please contact me so we can resolve it.

A few hours later, I got a message from the guy who lives directly below the barking dog lady in the same building! He said he also works from home and that it also drives him absolutely nuts but he felt ""guilty"" about doing something about it. He was able to provide me with the name of the owner and the apartment number. He said he is going to contact the property manager and if necessary, bring it up at the HOA meeting, as he is also really fed up with it. He told me he observes the owner barely care for the dog (she's a working person, thus not at home during the day) and she just barely lets the dog go out for \~5 minutes just to pee and then locks it up in the apt all day, hence its anxiety crazy barking. (Crappy owners indeed...)

All in all, this looks really promising! I was not expecting to get such a quick response...of course, it's not an guaranteed fix but I already feel so much better knowing that it's not just me who is driven insane by this mutt!

I happened to walk off without my pepper spray and even at that, really did not want to push by this animal or spray it with people around. I stood at the edge of the property 20 or so meters away and watched it follow people, approach them, etc. It looked somewhat aggressive with one of them but it is hard to tell at the angle I had. It wouldn't surprise me. Several people seemed annoyed. A few didn't seem to mind. Until later, no one seemed happy or enthusiastic about it. 

In any case, I've seen this *same* dog loose before. It belongs to someone and it wanders around the gas-station/strip mall, probably looking in the garbage. The city has a leash law, and I've unfortunately seen an increase in people (most of them with what appears to be pits) walking with their unleashed dogs and leaving them at the doorway to the store. I don't go there very often but I see it maybe twice a month. It is annoying, and as you would expect most of them look and act in a *low-class* manner in and around the store (beyond having this dog and breaking the law with it.) They probably do it because they think/know no one will approach them, or because a leash would cut into their meth money.

 I waited 10 minutes for this dog to get far enough from the door that I could safely go inside to get what I came for (and since I was walking, I didn't have another option to just drive somewhere else.) Inside the clerk said it had been there for a while. I waited by the door inside at least another 5 minutes for it to move so I could leave and then the worst part happened.

This lady **actually buys a hot dog and walks up to the dog and sets it in the handicapped spot next to her car for the dog** who is pacing in front of the store (for at least 15 minutes that I personally witnessed). She encouraging this animal to camp on someone else's property, who is annoying other people and is an illegal hazard. She seems happy like she has just earned herself the Nobel prize.

After this, while the dog was distracted, I quickly walked the opposite direction and called animal control and explained that this large pit bull dog was at gas station/store at cross-streets A &amp; B, that it had been there and was approaching people, and that the clerk had said it had been there for ""a while."" AC actually came and picked the dog up fairly quickly. I did not identify myself as the caller. They came, they looped the thing around its neck, put it in the kennel, and drove off.

Justice.

Plus, all the lady who fed the dog succeed in was helping to keep the dog in a single spot long enough so Animal Control could pick it up. *Thanks for the assist!* Hopefully the impound fees and ticket will make the owners think again about keeping this animal and failing to control it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was walking to the gas station near my house for a soda today, and there is a large black pit-bull standing at the doorway to the station. I happened to walk off without my pepper spray and even at that, really did not want to push by this animal or spray it with people around. I stood at the edge of the property 20 or so meters away and watched it follow people, approach them, etc. It looked somewhat aggressive with one of them but it is hard to tell at the angle I had. It wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me. Several people seemed annoyed. A few didn&amp;#39;t seem to mind. Until later, no one seemed happy or enthusiastic about it. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m new to this group and I’m so glad I found it.

I’m 26f and have been living dog free in a cozy little condo for two years with just a cat. I grew up with cats. Parents got a dog (shih tzu) when I was 16. He’s not a bad dog, he’s mildly annoying. It was less the dog himself and more the way my mom turned into a crazy dog person with him that bothered me.

I have always hated going to peoples houses who have dogs, especially big dogs. I don’t like being licked, I don’t like being jumped on, I don’t like being wetly breathed on, I don’t like being barked/snorted/growled at, etc. Most of my friends don’t have dogs. The ones who do, they come to my place way more often than I do theirs. 

This brings me to my main point. Somehow, I luckily managed to always end up dating people who are dog-free. Until recently. I dated a guy for five months. Don’t get me wrong, he had his share of issues (hence dated in past tense) but the DOG, for the love of God. This thing was a Pitbull/bulldog mix and was an absolute nightmare. 
- Constantly jumped on me. Wouldn’t leave us alone or let us touch or even sit next to each other without jumping between us and aggressively barking/snarling in my face. I’ve never had a phobia of dogs, but the way her eyes would bug out and her jaw would practically unhinge as she barked in my face genuinely scared me. 
- Slept in the bed vertically like a human, head on the pillow, in between us. 
- He lovingly referred to the dog as “the Whoopers” (nowhere close to her actual name btw) which would drive me up the wall. 
- When we would eat, she’d sit an inch away from my face, staring at me while I tried to ignore her, and whimper loudly for my food. He knew this bothered me and did nothing to stop her, one time even saying “oh whoopers, you’re so pretty, even when you beg.” 
- She farted 24/7. She smelled. His house, which was otherwise clean and tidy, always smelled like wet dog. Especially his sheets.
- She hindered all of our plans. We couldn’t plan a road trip, a night away, etc. I’d either have to go to his house and deal with the dog, or he’d stay over mine but complain about missing the dog the whole time. 

He broke up with me in March and I actually got over it way quicker than I expected to because I realized that I never had to deal with “the Whoopers” again. 

I went on a date with a girl in April. Beautiful girl, great conversation, awesome time. But then she told me that she had a pit. My stomach flopped. I told her, as politely as I could, that dogs (I didn’t say this but Pitbulls specifically) are kind of a dealbreaker for me. 

It took me until I was 25 to realize I can’t ever date a dog owner. I’d love to hear some of your stories about dealing with your ex’s/SO’s dog(s).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all. I’m new to this group and I’m so glad I found it.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the rules which changed way back in 2001 due to the mounting pressure from not for profit organizations fighting for Animal(when they say animals they mean dogs) rights.    
1.) You will be jailed or heavily fined if you kill a dog even in self defense. By killing I mean 'The dog won't be put down' because there's no organization for Animal control. By killing I also mean that if a dog attacks you and you fight back and in that process the dog dies, you're fucked. There's a government body called Municipal Corporation(MC) that is supposed to take action on such requests but they don't do jack shit because of a threat of a legal action by Not for Profit Orgs(NPO).     
2.) Whenever one contacts the MC, they forward your complaint to these NPOs and they also don't do jack shit due to lack of funding and donations.        
3.) You cannot catch and put stray dogs in Animal shelters because there are no Animal shelters. You cannot even relocate the dog to another area as it is punishable by either imprisonment or monetary fine.   
4.) Neutering and Spaying is also not a possibility. Simply put, the government has taken zero initiative to launch a drive to neuter and spay these filthy mutts. NPOs again don't have the funding so they don't even bother themselves about it.     
5.) A dog won't be put down as long as it's healthy. It doesn't matter whether it has bitten countless people, killed another human being, as long as it is healthy it won't be put down.       

Here's an article by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/world/asia/india-stray-dogs-are-a-menace.html) that should put things into perspective. It's old but it's succint and still managed to stay relevant even after 7 years.     
Here's another article by [CNN](https://edition-m.cnn.com/2015/07/13/asia/india-dog-culling/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) which covers how an appeal to cull stray dogs was rejected. One thing I'd like to mention is the reason behind snapping 100% of the stray dog population was to tackle rabies which well there's no way to put it, very rampant in India.    
 Here's another article by [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-india-36035456) which makes a direct comparisons by casualty caused by stray dogs and terrorists. If you don't want to read the article, it says that dog bites have **killed more people in Mumbai than the worst Terrorist attacks that happened between 1993 and 2008.**  To give you the severity of the situation, the 26/11 attack in India(one of the worst Terrorist attack in our history) is what 9/11 is to US.      
I can go on and on and on but you get the point.     

I acquired all this useless knowledge about dogs and dog laws in a span of 3 days because I wanted to get rid of a female dog that has been terrorizing our locality from the past 2 years.     
Every 6 months she gives birth to a litter of puppies, which ensues her paranoia that every living being that's not her is trying to get her kids. You go even in her general direction, chances are pretty high you're gonna get bit.   
16 people have been bit by a single dog in the span of 2 years and I suspect it's not going to stop anytime soon. The most recent being the day before yesterday where our domestic help was bitten for no reason at all.  
All in all, the only way to get rid of a stray dog is either wait for the nature to run its course and the dog die of natural causes or hope that the dog moves to another area.    
I looked for any group or NPO which shared our collective idea but failed to do so. There's no point in writing to the government, the not for profit organizations are against you and you don't stand a chance.    
I guess the only way is to suffer in silence and do nothing while a menace roams free on the streets.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in India and for a country where a majority of people don&amp;#39;t like dogs even in general and where the pet culture has just started to take off, it is ironic that you cannot do anything when it comes to getting rid of stray dogs who have terrorized the area where you live.&lt;br/&gt;

I just found the doggo hypocrisy interesting. 

This time last Thursday I lost my 8 month old Abyssinian kitten Islay suddenly to a cardiac arrest. 

Clique but I was pretty close to this animal, she was a very loving friend. 

I had messaged my nail tech to say I couldn’t make my appointment the next day because I was pretty upset and obviously I had to deal with organising her collection, cremation, cancelling her pet policy, microchip etc. 

When I met with her last night I told her about how super supportive everyone at my work had been by letting me take time off during a busy project to deal with all this, considering it’s a pet etc. 

She then told me how when she got my message she was upset for me and told two of the salon girls she works with who are both dog owners what had happened and “wasn’t that sad, especially just a kitten?” 

The both just stated at her and we’re both like “it was just a cat...”

She was a bit taken aback. Especially seeing as these were animal lovers who had dogs that they talked about pretty much all day long. Apparently not. 

One of the girls went on to expand and say “I mean if I ran a dog over I would literally be heart broken and I would so anything I could to try and save it. But if it was a cat I just wouldn’t care.”

WHAT THE HELL?

Like I accept that not everyone likes animals but the hypocrisy here is astounding. It’s a living thing either way right? 

I can’t stand dogs but I would never like to think of any living creature getting hurt and even though I don’t really like them I wouldn’t want it to suffer so I would try to help. 

I don’t like children, but if something bad was to happen and I was there I would go out of my way to help another person.

I honestly can’t believe the hypocrisy of some of these doggo people? Like their mutt is more important than other living creatures?

We haven’t seen them or the dog since. Now that some time has gone by we all have a vacation scheduled there the 4th of july, so we decided to ask what they’re doing about the dog. He said that he cant board him because it will mess up the training and is going to bring the dog. Saying it will probably be ok... that is not ok with us at all.

 particularly horrible specimen, but it does bark frequently and pees inside and is very hyper. I have to deal with preparing all the food (raw food like tripe) and walking it when my mom isn't around.

When I was about at the summit of the highway I see an animal dart into the road and I hit the brakes.  At first I thought it was a fox or coyote, but then notice it has a collar. I pull over and my son’s father starts to try to coax the thing over with a piece of jerky, and it works. It gets in our car and he’s all smitten (he has a soft spot) and it turns out to be a Shiba Inu.  Before he gets all puppy yuppy worked up about it I explain that there are several campgrounds nearby and we need to go drive through them and try to find its owners. I spent about an hour doing so at no avail. As I assess the situation I realize the dog is VERY hungry and VERY thirsty, and quite dirty, so he’s been in the mountains for at least a few days. I didn’t want to stop our vacation and drive back to town, so I allowed it to come along with the plan of posting on FB and calling shelters. When we get to the next (tiny) town on our trip I stop and by the dog necessities, food, leash and I refused to take it without a scrub down, so grooming supplies. (Mind you this stuff is 2x$ in mountain towns.  He suds the thing up in the river and it sleeps in the car at night. 

When we get home it’s late and I don’t have time check in with shelters or vets, and after three days of the post on FB, nobody has claimed it. I go to Walmart and buy more dog supplies, a kennel for it to sleep in, etc... at this point my former SO was getting attached, “we’ll, they lost it, so they must be irresponsible”. “He really likes you, we should just keep it”. I explained to him that we had to check in case it was microchipped, it might have been stolen (I also didn’t want to keep it, I’m busy enough as it is!). I took it to a vet to have it scanned and it was indeed registered.  They called the number on file and left a message with my contact, so I took him home and waited for their reply.

A couple hours later a very excited and hyper woman calls me back.  She said she has 5 kids and that the dog has been missing for over a year, and they live two cities down from me. She also said that the dog would always “get lost” every time she put it in the yard (I learned Shiba Inus are always doing that, very dumb). I actually offered to drive the dog to her town and return it myself, but she said that she would drive over with her kids and get it, thank you thank you, blah blah blah.  Well, two days go by and there’s just these erratic texts from her, I’m coming, I can’t make it, kids, no kids. Can’t do it!  Finally she said her husband was going to drive over after work and pick him up.... I waited and waited, two hours late he shows up.  I open the door and was expecting to tell him the whole tale of my week tracking down and reuniting the “family”. I had all the supplies I bought packed up and ready to give to them.  Nope!  He literally just reached into my door, grabbed the dog, and briefly complained “this dog is so stupid, he’s going to run away again”.  I walked out and asked him if he wanted the food and supplies. “No, just keep it”.  Now, I’m not looking for some kinda f*ing medal and I have no savior complex; but the whole reason I ever went to the lengths I did was because I thought perhaps I was doing “the right thing” and helping a family that might be missing a loved one. (In retrospect he was likely right about the dog, but come on guy, can you at least pretend to say Thank You!). 

Anyway, I was really peeved, and seethed on it for a couple days. This was before I really embraced my second wave of dog disdain and was just trying to do the right thing.  I’ll actually never EVER do that again, the nicest thing I’ll do is call the animal shelter and report a lost dog, but this was in such a remote an unusual area to see one. After a couple days of being really pissy about it all the “Momma” texts me... OMG, my kids are SO happy, thank you SO much. You are a hero, etc. I explain to her the steps I took and politely implied that I spent $$ to reunite them. She asks me for my address and says she’s going to send me something as a gratitude. I mean, I don’t want to come off as if I did it for a reward, but I also don’t think it’s unfair to mention what I did for them, especially after how rude her husband was. Like, if it was some little old lady or something that expressed genuine gratitude, I would have counted my losses and been fulfilled with that!

When the “Thank You” arrived in my mail I felt good, like, maybe her husband is just a dick and she’s busy but really cares. (All I really wanted was a note and correspondence). Guess what it was... two pairs of the ugliest least sellable LuLaRoe leggings I’ve ever seen in my life!  And a heartfelt note was included... inviting me to empower myself and own my own destiny, from the #bossbabe herself. Her thank you was literally an invitation to a pyramid scheme.

I'd like to let you guys know how you have it easy compared to some of us who live in not-so developed countries lol(well in terms of canine problems that is).

I live in Turkey and like most underdeveloped countries, we have a stray dog problem. In the city where I used to live and go to university, there was approximately one stray dog for every ten people(legit statistics) and a similar situation is present with every city. That means when you're walking around in downtown, you come across a stray dog or a pack of dogs every few streets. Parks? Literal dog sanctuaries. And if you haven't guessed it already, these dogs will often bark and chase people and sometimes outright attack them. Obviously, there have been countless injuries and some deaths even. The dogs get especially agressive at night time and guess who likes to take late night walks? I have been chased many times and even attacked a few times but thankfully have been able to fend the dogs off without getting bit(had some really close calls though).

This problem is the result of the law that governs how local governments should deal with stray dogs. According to the law, stray dogs are to be caught, neutered, vaccinated and then put in a dog shelter. However(here comes the truly facepalm worthy part), if there's no space in the dog shelters, the dogs are to be released back to where they were caught. Yeah you heard it right: it's illegal for local governments to put down stray dogs. And since the problem has been far out of hand for many years now, there are always many unneutered and unvaccinated dogs out on the streets as well.

A lot of people are discontent with the stray dog problem and with the law mentioned but guess which group fights with all they have to keep things as they are: Nutters. Compared to developed countries, my country's nutters are a very small minority of the general populace but they're so vocal and active that they get things their way and make life hell for a group of people that far outnumber them(I'd guess at least a third of the country's population want stray dogs gone but it's probably the majority really). There have been heated arguments over this issue in our biggest internet forums in the recent years(we have a few big ones similar to reddit). There haven't been any improvements to the issue though. There's a big post with thousands of replies in our biggest internet forum titled ""We don't want dogs on the streets"".Hundreds of nutters have replied to that post with comments that contain this same line: ""We don't want humans in the streets, how about that?"". In light of this incident, I'd like to nominate our nutters as the most braindead ones in the world.

I used to love dogs and even regularly pet stray dogs but getting attacked and especially the attitude of our nutters changed me into a dog hater over the years.

Let me add as a final side note that it's illegal to carry any self defense tools in my country. We basically have small wolves all over our living space and no way to defend ourselves against them.

For those who don’t know, “People with misophonia can become irritated, enraged, or even panicked when they hear their trigger sounds.” And as I’m sure many of you can relate to, the worst trigger sound in the world is dogs licking themselves. 

  The sound is so horrible and disgusting I cannot stop myself from getting upset. It’s like an instant, visceral reaction. Currently living with four dogs, one of which is a Great Dane. The biggest, stupidest thing also has the largest tongue and produces a sound that sounds like a wet slurp right in your ear. The dog is downstairs and even with my door closed it’s a sound I’m very sensitive to and hate. I jump out of my seat and just get so easily angered. 

  The same thing happens with barking. The other three dogs are small, so it’s the high pitched, shrill, loud yapping. Constantly. They bark at nothing and everything and would probably find a way to bark even if you cut out their voice boxes. “Nails on a chalkboard” needs to be replaced with “small chihuahua barking” because dear lord it’s an unbearable sound 

  I envy deaf people. I envy you all so much. You don’t ever have to experience the hell that is a dog barking at midnight nonstop because the neighbour is out of town. 

  I hope someone understands. It’s nice to rant about it!

+--------------------------------------
Driving home from the hospital with my daughter and coming around an apartment complex and saw an Indian lady kind of throw herself to the ground in the fetal position from a distance.  Saw her get up and run around the corner of the building and a giant German Sheppard chasing after her off leash and she jumped down again kind of in the fetal position as the dog jumped on her.

I put my hazards on and pulled over and started yelling at the dog distract it and then saw the owner come around the corner saying ""im so sorry"" as she was dragging another shit beast on a leash (maybe a yellow lab) and trying to get the dog to come with her.

The owner was maybe a 25 year old girl 250 lbs who couldn't control either of these two massive dogs that were maybe 80 lbs each. I yelled at her ""get your dog on a leash now!"" and she cried ""I'm trying ....!"".

Finally the dog backed off the victim as I approached the victim yelling ""hey hey"" and dancing around to distract the dog. He ran a circle near me and I started worrying for a sec.  Was probably a stupid thing to do but I left my concealed carry and pepper spray at home (always when you need it).   I left the car door open partially so I could jump back in if needed if the dog came at me. My mother was in the car also so I wasn't leaving my daughter behind.

The victim said she wasn't bitten but was scared for her life and I urged her to call the police and file a police report.  Some other indian neighbors of hers came out after hearing the commotion and I yelled at them to call the police and as soon as the dog owner heard me say call the police:  **POOF** she disappeared as fast as she could between the two buildings and I didn't get a chance to follow her while checking on the victim.

I went to the apartment office and told the manager and she said the dogs are supposed to be leashed at all times.  I gave her a detailed description of the dogs and dog owner and the location where it occurred and she started investigating to see who it was.

When I was little, I loved dogs. I always wanted one, but since I've also always lived with at least 2 or more cats at once, we couldn't afford it. Huskies were my favorite. I always dreamed about getting a dog of my own, but that was all shattered due to a combination of a dangerous, untrained dog, and the ignorant family that owned it.

In October of 2015, (Can't remember the exact day, I may have some repressed memories so apologies for any holes in this post.) my former best friend and I were just messing around. It seemed like a normal day, but we got bored. Eventually we went over to a boy's house to ask if he wanted to play Pokemon. Seconds after he opened the door, his nasty mastiff poked his head out the crack of the door. Mind you, this mastiff did NOT fit the ""normal"" mastiff behavior. It was extremely aggressive to everyone except for its' family- and even its' owners couldn't control him. He was too big, and honestly, a danger.

The boy grabbed the dog's collar and tried pulling him back, as the door flung wide open. Long story short, my friend bolted where I stood frozen in fear. The bastard got me right on the knee and shook me a little. Felt like a lifetime. After the boy quickly got me inside, gave me an ice pack, and ran outside to get his dog, chaos ensued. His 8 months PREGNANT mother was panicking and rushing outside too. I was in too much shock at the time, but I could hear screams and barking from multiple dogs.

**After the fact, multiple witnesses filled me in on what happened;**

**1.** My former best friend tried running to her home a few doors down. The dog literally *broke* through her gate and got her on the wrist.

**2.** The friend's old dog (black lab) got outside and tried fighting the mastiff, ended up getting several stitches on his shoulder afterwards.

**3.** After the mastiff was done terrorizing my friend and her dog, he crashed through their gate once more and chased an old man on top of a car. Luckily he wasn't injured, and he was the one who called the police.

**4.** The brute was finally restrained by animal control and its' owners after a few minutes of the events above. In the end he was put down, as this wasn't the first incident.

Even though my physical injury has mostly healed, with occasional pain/soreness in my knee, I don't know if I'll ever fully recover from a mental and emotional standpoint. I can't be around dogs without my anxiety spiking. I can see dog pictures/videos (And sometimes I force myself to do so in an attempt to desensitize myself again.) most of the time, but whenever someone sends me a dog picture/video without warning me, I lock up. Sometimes I can't look away, and I end up having a full on panic attack that takes me a lot of sleep to recover from.

The worst thing about this all is that I heard my neighbors gossiping about me after the attack, saying that the dog shouldn't have been put down and that it was my friend and I, the VICTIMS', faults and that no dog could do wrong and yada yada yada. That kind of bs.

Anyone else who has trauma with dogs or have been hurt by dogs, please feel free to sound off in the comments! It was great when I stumbled upon this *legit* community, and it'd be even greater if people who have had similar experiences interacted with me in some way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Obligatory first post and apology for grammar/formatting mistakes note.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The main goal of this poster was to push the next gen of dog lovers (high school) to be more sane, and limit the number of dogs. Ah well, with the school year ending, I do feel proud of the number I have convinced, though feel as if I could have done more.

If you don't like dogs, then you're a bitch and a horrible person. Or at least, that's what the internet thinks and to be honest, this mentality sucks so hard.


Dogs can be a pain in the ass to deal with, and just today I read a post here about a person who lived with two huskies and basically her life was hell. Is she a bad person for not wanting to deal with the dogs anymore and making her boyfriend get rid of them? No. She's not. 


I wish people understood that not liking dogs doesn't means you're a bad person. I kinda wanted to comment on the said post (about the cardboard guy), but I'd be downvoted to hell because Reddit loves dogs and can't accept contrary opinions. 

I posted here before, I actually live with four dogs and they bark all day long and when there are rare moments of silence, if they hear a slight sound, they'll start bark again.

Now the dog is getting older. SO has told me that when it is time for the dog to die, he won't take him to get euthanized, that it will be up to me to take him because he doesn't want to see it die.

Now I may not like this dog, but I'm far from heartless. I think the final kindness and act of friendship/love you can give to your beloved animal is to be with them when they go. The dog won't want me to be with him when he goes, he'll want my SO. 

I've tried explaining this to him, but he is adamant that he can't do it.

Is there any other way someone can explain why he should go that I might be able to get across to him?

Now I could go on about the problems with dog breeding for hours. So I'm going to keep this as focused as possible. Mostly talking about the lack of regulations and why I believe it's important. This whole idea started with me seeing a lot of back and forth among dog owners about what makes a reputable dog breeder. My opinion has always been there really isn't such a thing. 

Why do I think that? Well mostly because dog breeding is a business that isn't treated like a business. There is either a complete lack of oversight or the oversight is incredibly lax to the point it might as well not exist at all. A little less than half of all US states don't have any laws related to dog breeding. The states that do have laws that define a dog breeder are very generous. In 17 of these states you would need to have over 10 dogs at a time to be considered a dog breeder. Only 14 states require any kind of inspections to be performed. If you fall within the laws that may exist than you're considered a 'commercial breeder.' So these people would need licenses and occasionally inspections to maintain a certain level of care.

What this all means is that most dog breeders are what is commonly called hobby breeders. They breed a few litters a year so as to fly under the radar of any actual scrutiny. These hobby breeders are where your supposed reputable breeders come from. They claim to be in it for the love of their preferred breed and that they don't breed for profit. It's a ridiculous false claim that is made solely so they can seem like amazing upstanding people doing what they love. Instead of the business owners that they actually are. As puppies from these breeders are easily $1000 each and even as high as $5000. So the difference between a 'backyard breeder' and a 'hobby breeder' is a bigger price tag and some paperwork.

So you might be wondering why should you care. You're not buying any of these dogs. Which is a fair criticism. I would say to that hypothetical question that I asked myself, you should care because dog overpopulation is a serious problem. The people around you are buying and breeding these dogs. Contributing to a problem that effects everyone. Anyone that sells dogs should be scrutinized, regardless of how they go about selling them. And hobby breeders, more than any other people, fight against this idea in force.

So called hobby breeders do not want stricter regulations that they will get caught in. They do not want anyone looking at what they do. And this is where I will be speaking more opinion than fact, I believe it's because dog breeding as a business would die if this happened. People aren't buying dogs to perform work. There is no need for the average person looking for a dog to spend thousands on a breed-conforming dog that's just going to loaf around their house. If it got more difficult, either for the breeder or the buyer, than people wouldn't buy or sell these dogs anymore. 

Breeders want nothing more than for their choice breed to simply keep existing. For some breeds, this is actually a challenge. No one needs dogs anymore. This isn't the old days where dogs were used for practical things like hunting, herding, and protection. Even the jobs that dogs still do are questionable. Detection dogs of all kinds are especially suspect. When attempts to tighten up the restrictions on dog breeding are proposed, these breeders come out to fight it tooth and nail. The AKC even supports this attitude by posting news on their website and providing templates for people to write letters to politicians.

I believe they know that it could all go down quickly. They are lucky that people are obsessed with puppy mills and 'unethical breeders.' That the industry as a whole is being allowed to go unchecked. Because maybe. Just maybe. If people actually paid attention to them then they would see what a rampant, abhorrent practice dog breeding really is. The health problems caused by inbreeding. The physical deformities supported by show organizations. The forced insemination of dogs that are literally incapable of naturally breeding. The surgeries performed on dogs that are also incapable of giving birth naturally. The amount of dogs that are being poured out into an already overwhelmed population.

I am so sick and tired of people like you spreading these lies and misinformation not only about dogs, but pit bulls in particular. IT’S NOT THE DOGS FAULT, blame the owners especially these irresponsible parents! Every time I see these articles about pit bulls “attacking” kids the worthless parents OBVIOUSLY weren’t around to supervise them! And the children aren’t innocent either, they deserve anything that comes to them if they can’t respect a dog’s space.

My wife and I have implemented a strict method in our household to keep our 3 and 5 year old boys from disturbing our 7 rescue pittie babies. Any bodily functions associated with loud noise (sneezes, etc) are to be done quietly into a designated pillow in the front yard at least 25 feet from the house. We’ve also rigged up some specialized padded shoes that minimize the decibel level of footfalls inside where hardwood floors are (actually working on getting a patent for these shoes, they’re great). Additionally, sunglasses MUST be worn when in the presence of the dogs, as any inadvertent eye contact can be perceived as a threat. My wife and I removed the bay door from our garage to cut down on noise, too. This system really works!

We did have one tiny, insignificant hiccup however. My son and his friends were unfortunately mauled due to the commotion from a game of Horse during his 5th birthday party. He lost his left hand, but he’s right-handed so no problem. Luckily, we were able to stop the bleeding and then promptly get one of the dogs to the emergency vet in case the bones scraped his esophagus on the way down. The doggos must’ve thought my son and his friends were being attacked by the basketball so they tried to protect him the only way they knew how. We immediately got rid of the basketball goal and all sports-related items in our household to keep this from happening again in the future.

See, you guys are simply uninformed and frankly, ignorant. If you take the right precautions, dogs - ESPECIALLY pitties - are the sweetest, most loving and harmless companions you could ask for.

FACT: Pit bulls were first bred in 1864 by English physician Bertram Pitt-Bowles to perform open-heart surgery on premature babies, literally saving BILLIONS of lives during the late 19th century. You assholes need to get your facts straight before you judge the breed. Actually, what even IS a “pit bull” any way?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have to start off by saying that I grew up with dogs my entire life. The only time I didn't have a dog was the years I spent in undergrad. We had two an older pitt growing up and he is the sweetest, most laid back low maintenance dog in the entire world. I was not aware that all dogs were not as invasive or demanding. I didn't realize how lucky I was growing up to have such a well-behaved dog. With that said, my mom was also a stay at home mom a lot of the time, so that could be a big factor.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, let's get into the real story. I met the love of my life when I was a senior in college. We hit it off instantly. Due to my roommate stealing money from me, he and I moved in together very soon on in our relationship (after being together for about 5 months). It made sense since he owns his house and we spend every night together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, at the time I moved in, he had 2 four-year-old huskies, a male and a female. The male was dumb as bricks but very sweet, but obviously abused  previously (he was a rescue), gang-ly and wolf-like, weighing in at around 70 pounds. He loved people but was very jumpy and would snap at any sudden movements, out of what I assumed was fear. It hurt when he jumped on you, you would get scratched and pummeled.  The female was a very intelligent, very beautiful husky about 60 pounds. But she  was very self-interested and was overly attached to my boyfriend. She didn't really seem to like anyone other than him. I didn't mind at first. The dogs and I got along okay. Boyfriend actually says I'm the first girl he's ever brought the female dog around that she didn't hate. I felt honored. But my god, are these dogs hyper. They had the energy of a 3 year old hopped up on an IV of mountain dew. The female slept in bed with us, something I didn't like but tolerated. After all, the dogs were there before me. I didn't mind the dog hair or the howling at first either. It was a little endearing. And seeing how much my boyfriend cared, that was heart warming.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I started to realize the issues with these dogs. I noticed the dogs had crates, which I found to be shocking because we never crated our dog. Boyfriend tells me they HAVE to be crated, or else they eat furniture. I didn't believe him at first until he shows me a picture. And I'm not talking about chewing a cushion, I'm talking the actually wooden base of the chair was gone. They ATE THE WHOLE CHAIR. But you know, your dogs. Whatever. So they are crated while he is at work. And he works decently long hours, leaving the house around 8 and getting home around 4 sometime later if he has work meetings. He also feeds them raw chicken. Not going to lie, that always grossed me out. And it was super expensive. They dogs were always very aggressive around their food. He would feed them roughly 5-10 pounds once a day, so they were always begging for food. And not in the cutesy sit in front of you and widen your eyes type of begging. More like actively try to take your food. Panting on your leg, running around the table in circles, barking, attempting to climb onto the table. I've always struggled with my relationship with food, so this was one of the first things to really wear on me. I couldn't eat without literally being hounded. No matter how many treats I gave them or how much I shared my food, I could not eat in peace. So, we've now lost joy in eating. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

When I moved into the house, there was an extra bedroom that was completely empty, aside from some piles of dog shit and spider webs. I made it my project and turned that room into a walk in closet. I could not tell you how many times the dogs pissed and shit on the floor and on piles of our clothes. Definitely hundreds of dollars in clothing lost over time. And then there was the basement, oh the basement. Somehow, as much as the dogs shit and pissed everywhere else in the house, they still managed to sneak into the basement and piss and shit there. Boyfriend would clean it up often, but it would somehow ALWAYS be covered in more. It was to the point where we couldn't have a plumber over because of what a horror show it was in the basement. He kept the dogs crates in the bedroom, which was also where he fed them raw chicken. So their  corner of the room was always a cesspool of raw chicken germs and husky hair. Gross. 

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the sleeping situation. As I said the female slept in bed with us. Now after however many years, these two dogs were NOT house trained. They peed or pooped in the house daily and nightly. I can imagine very few mornings where we didn't wake up to piss and shit all over the floor. The female sleeping the bed was roughly 60 pounds and took up a lot of space. If I would accidentally or purposefully nudge her she would growl at me and get off the bed and sit on the floor and whine. Without stopping. Boyfriend would then have to spend a solid 15 minutes coaxing her back into bed. Only for the entire process to repeat the entire night. I have chronic cluster migraines and nothing triggers them more than lack of proper sleep. I lost countless nights of sleep and suffered in immeasurable amount of migraines from the whining. There were nights where neither of us slept. Boyfriend would take them out again and again and still it didn't stop. I remember him breaking down in tears over it on more than several occasions. There wasn't room for the male dog in bed so he slept alone on the floor and would make licking noises the entire night. I eventually lobbied to have the dogs not sleep out, and sleep in their crates. Boyfriend objected at first, he said it was mean for them to be in their crates all night and all day. But I couldn't sleep with the three of us in the bed, the hardwood floor was becoming bleached of color from us cleaning the same dog piss/shit spots over and over again. The dogs being in the crates meant that the female would whine for a minimum of an hour before realizing she wasn't going to get out and would stop. In that hour, we tried everything. Being quiet and ignoring her. My boyfriend tried yelling at them, singing to them, shushing them, and chastising them. None of it seemed to have any sort of result. Occasionally if you ignored the female for too long, she would start to bark and howl instead of just whining. In addition to all of this was the constant, rancid farts from their diet of only raw chicken. Often times, the raw chicken would make them sick if we got a bad batch. And we would have the two of them shit and vomit everywhere in the house. The house reeked of wet dog and dog vagina. This was my hell. I worked an hour away from home. And would drive to work in tears, exhausted and traumatized from night of whining and yelling, knowing that I had an hour of rush hour traffic ahead of me. I would consume ungodly amounts of caffeine and tell myself that I was strong enough, I could do this.

&amp;#x200B;

It got to the point where being at home gave me anxiety. I would often times sit in my car for a good 10-20 minutes because I was putting off what was behind those doors. By the time I reached the side walk in front of the house, rampant howling and dashing around the house. The dogs would jump on me and bark and howl every single time I or my boyfriend came home. It gave me instant anxiety. Then they would do laps around the house, licking and smelling all of me and all of my purse/gym back/whatever it was that I brought home with me. Cooking, one of my and my boyfriend's greater joys in life, was no longer enjoyable for me. Cooking with the dogs meant jumping, running circles through your legs, trying to steal food off the counter, trying to get into the garbage and being stepped on. The dogs broke my boyfriends toes on several occasions. And cooking without the dogs meant an onslaught of non stop yelping. You would think we were murdering them by not letting them into the kitchen. So I stopped cooking at all and let my boyfriend deal with the two hell hounds in the kitchen. I can't tell you how many times I was on the verge of an outburst just from not being able to operate in my own kitchen. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a stressful cooking and an even more stressful dinner, we would take the dogs for a walk. We didn't have a fenced in back yard  (living in the city) and there was not a realistic way to fence it in, I swear. So, they were always confined to the house. They also though that escaping was a fun game. You could not have them off leash EVER or else they'd bolt. And I told my boyfriend each and every time not to run after them, that he was encouraging this habit, and I would NOT chase after those dogs or any dog ever. I was raised with the belief that if you have to cage up an animal to keep it from running away, than that animal isn't really yours. Regardless, he would chase after them every time, saying he didn't want them to get hit by a car or stolen. Walking them was terrible. All the did was pull and try to run or chase after anything and everything. The female always had to be walking faster than the male. She'd strangle herself in that pursuit. The male did not get along with other dogs, so we couldn't take them to the dog park. Overall, walking them was terrible. I'd been knocked down, pulled, dragged, stepped on, you name it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a walk, you'd think they'd be tired but no. The female had some sort of separation anxiety. She would whine if she wasn't given constant attention. And I mean constant. If you were not petting her, she was whining. I read up on the topic and told my boyfriend that we needed to not make a big deal of coming or leaving from the house, but he would always rile them up when he got home. Shouting ""Huskieeeeeees!"" And then howling at them from the second he would get out of his car. I'm sure the neighbors loved that. If the female was ever quiet, it's because she was eating herself out. Like moaning and going to town on her own clit and asshole for hours. It was one of the most repulsive things to have to listen to and watch. The female was also very aggressive towards me. She would bark at me if I was kissing my boyfriend. Snapped at me on several occasions. Would take my seat when I got up and growl and snap at me when I came back and told her to move. We even got the dogs their own chairs, didn't matter to her. If my boyfriend wasn't giving her 100% of his attention all of the time, she was whining. I always assumed they stopped whining while we were at work after a while. But I asked the neighbors once and they said that the dogs would whine and bark the entire time we were gone. How no one ever called the police on us is a miracle. My boyfriend drives a 2 door corvette that the dogs do not fit in and that they are not allowed in. This means we were incapable of driving them anywhere. I let him drive them a few times in my car, only to have it  covered in dog hair, scratched up, and drooled all over. I told him I didn't want them in my car anymore, and it wasn't fair to expect me to, given that he didn't want them in his car either.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I tried. I tried to help my boyfriend with the dogs. To exercise them more and try to train them to have better manners. But it never worked. We just didn't have the time or energy that these dogs needed. We both worked more than 40 hours a week and liked to travel and go out on the weekends. I didn't understand why he'd ever signed up for this in the first place. It was, at it's core, completely irresponsible. And after many sleepless nights and gourmet dinners stolen by the dog while I went hungry, I decided to have a more hands off approach. One, I needed it for my sanity. Two, I thought maybe the burden of all of this alone would wear on my boyfriend and make him see that change was needed. It sucked, we couldn't stay out late without feeling bad or coming home to a crate of dog shit and shit covered dogs. We couldn't go anywhere overnight unless we found someone to stay at the house. These were my young years, and I felt like I was wasting them. Like I was dealing with responsibilities that I shouldn't have until I had children. I couldn't go anywhere without the dogs following me. Not even to the bathroom. I would shower and apply cocoa butter and they would follow me around and try to lick the cocoa butter off of me. They would take clean clothes and nest in them, rubbing themselves all over them. If you ignored them and they didn't howl, they would start neurotically licking the clothes you were wearing. There is nothing more disgusting than wearing a pair of jeans that is drenched in dog drool. They ate several pairs of my shoes whole. If I stepped onto the porch, they would whine and cry until I came back in. There was never a moment's peace. The dogs also didn't like each other. They got along well  okay. But the female was so jealous that she lashed out at the male dog all the time. She was awful to him. If you yelled at her, she would go and bite him. She would take his food. She would inhale her food as fast as she cold so that she could go take his from him. She would bark if you pet him. She was the absolute worst.  She'd snapped at me on many occasions (which my boyfriend said was because I was being mean to her) and had bit him more times than I can count. Yes, BIT HIM. I told him that was a liability. That it scared me. That if she bit him, then there was nothing to keep me safe from her. I had been sleeping downstairs for several months on and off (more on than off) and continued to. I couldn't sleep in the same room as them.. They kept me up all night, triggering stress, anxiety, and the worst....my migraines. It reduced me to tears so many times to be so down and out. Boyfriend didn't seem to be overly bothered about the fact that I wasn't sleeping in the same bed as him. This hurt me. I couldn't imagine why it didn't bother him that I had left his bed. To him, I think he viewed as the way we had to operate to make everything work. I for the most part was resigned to all of this. I stopped getting visibly agitated or scolding the dogs for bad behavior. The only comment I would make daily was to my boyfriend, telling him without fail that these dogs lessened the quality of my life and that I was not happy.

&amp;#x200B;

And one day, after FIVE YEARS, I snapped. I told my boyfriend I couldn't live with the dogs anymore. I told him I wasn't making this an ""it's me or the dog"" thing. But that all I knew was that I could NOT live with those dogs. Whether than meant us re-homing them or me moving into another place until they lived out their lives. All I knew is that I couldn't. I told my boyfriend that this dog relationship was dysfunctional. We had countless fights over the dogs. Me upset that he wasn't setting rules for the dogs. Him saying I was mean and hated the dogs. Me upset that he was favoring the female over the male. Him saying I had always wanted them gone. After a long and teary discussion my boyfriend said that he loved the dogs but that i was the love of his life. He said that he wanted to re-home them properly. I had tried to do this before, but he freaked out about not being the one in charge of it, so I told him if that's what he wanted to do that it needed to be him doing it so that he didn't feel like i was taking them from him. I also pointed out that this would be best for everyone. That the dogs could live with a family that had more time to devote to them. That he would be so much more stress-free and able to go out and enjoy life with me. He said he would write up biographies for them and post them to a bunch of sites. I was elated. Everything was going to work out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, a week later. I ask my boyfriend if he wrote the bio's. He says he's too busy with work. I leave it be for another week or so and he says's he's working on it. A month goes by and I sit him down and ask him what steps he's taken in re-homing the dogs. He admits to me that he hasn't done anything. And I flipped my shit. I told him that this was affecting my mental health and my well-being and he wasn't doing anything to fix it. That he wan't keeping his word. And that if he was ""too busy"" to write an adoption ad for these dogs, how in the world did he justify having enough time to properly take care of the dogs. I packed a bag of my things and I told him I was not coming back to this house until the dogs were gone. And that if he didn't figure out a solution to this soon, I would start looking for apartments to rent. I could only sleep on friend's couches for so long. I work an office job and I need to be a functional human being at my job. He begged me to come back home. I stood my ground. I said that I couldn't. That I realized how screwed up the situation was and that I couldn't subject myself to it any longer. I'd given him a month more of me living in misery and he'd done nothing. I couldn't wait around, hoping that he'd actually try to re-home them. Part of me worried that was a losing game. That he would use it to delay the process of getting rid of them And I needed him to understand that I needed this. I needed him to understand that I was serious. That I was DONE with those dogs. I was done living my life this way. He is the love of my life, but I can't sacrifice my own physical and mental well-being over this. That past month, I had an average of 3 migraines a week, I was miserable. I was barely sleeping, barely eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I stayed at a friend's house that night and me and my boyfriend went back and forth via text. I stood firm. I was not coming back until they were gone. And if that was going to take some time, he needed to let me know so that I could look for a temporary apartment. He thought I wanted to break up with him. When I vehemently explained that was not the case, he finally sent the text: ""Fine, I'm taking them to the shelter then."" I think he expected me to tell him not to. But I didn't. I told him to do that if that's what he needed to do. He still never attempted to re-home them properly and ended up dropping them off at the local no-kill shelter. While I was BEYOND relieved, I couldn't help but feel like this was the grand finale in what I viewed as an irresponsible owner. He told me it was the hardest thing he's ever done. I asked if he wanted to me come back home that night and he said no. That he wanted to be alone. That really fucked me up. That was when I started to worry that we weren't really on the same page about this issue. I came back home the next day to a very heartbroken boyfriend. I did feel bad, it hurt to see him so hurt. And I didn't hate the dogs, I didn't wish them any harm. I just wanted to be free of them.

&amp;#x200B;

That was in January and we've had several arguments about it since. He's accused me always having hating them and that I was plotting to get rid of them the whole time. And he's been depressed and gaining weight. Part of me wonders if I miscalculated? Not about me. I know I am 1000000000 time better off without those dogs in my life. I don't need coffee in the morning. I've had maybe two migraines in the past six months. But I'm really torn up about it. I can't help but be split between two different narratives and I do't know which one is the real one. Part of me feels like a terrible person. That I broke up a happy family, because I was the only unhappy one. That I should've played the martyr for longer. That I should have tried harder or been less demanding about them going so quickly. And then another part of me feels angry. Angry at myself for allowing my soul to be in such distress for so long. And angry at my boyfriend for not realizing the severity. I had told him for a long time that I wasn't happy and that it was because of the dogs. Why hadn't he heard me? Why hadn't he seen the distress I was in? Why would he expect me to stay in that dysfunctional situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Will it get better? Or is this going to be what breaks us? We are now engaged but I feel this huge distance between us and I feel like it's something I can't talk to him about. Because part of me is still so angry and part of me is still so guilty. I feel like I'm the bad guy. And I feel like it was completely unfair of him to put me in the situation where I had to be the one to say that enough is enough. I feel like I can't win. That I either had to choose between living with these dogs or in the shadow of these dogs. I just want to be free of them, completely. I don't want to live with the constant reminder of them being gone. I just want to move on with my life. How do I do that? How do I get my now fiance over this slump? I want us both to be happy, together. And I feel like what made me happy, made him miserable. I told him that there isn't a time line for grieving but everything feels so tense now. I hate seeing a dog, wondering if it's going to trigger him. I won't send him anything dog related. I just want to slip into an alternate reality where dogs never existed. Help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning, this is going to be long and probably more details than you need but fuck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have to start off by saying that I grew up with dogs my entire life. The only time I didn&amp;#39;t have a dog was the years I spent in undergrad. We had two an older pitt growing up and he is the sweetest, most laid back low maintenance dog in the entire world. I was not aware that all dogs were not as invasive or demanding. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how lucky I was growing up to have such a well-behaved dog. With that said, my mom was also a stay at home mom a lot of the time, so that could be a big factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, let&amp;#39;s get into the real story. I met the love of my life when I was a senior in college. We hit it off instantly. Due to my roommate stealing money from me, he and I moved in together very soon on in our relationship (after being together for about 5 months). It made sense since he owns his house and we spend every night together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at the time I moved in, he had 2 four-year-old huskies, a male and a female. The male was dumb as bricks but very sweet, but obviously abused  previously (he was a rescue), gang-ly and wolf-like, weighing in at around 70 pounds. He loved people but was very jumpy and would snap at any sudden movements, out of what I assumed was fear. It hurt when he jumped on you, you would get scratched and pummeled.  The female was a very intelligent, very beautiful husky about 60 pounds. But she  was very self-interested and was overly attached to my boyfriend. She didn&amp;#39;t really seem to like anyone other than him. I didn&amp;#39;t mind at first. The dogs and I got along okay. Boyfriend actually says I&amp;#39;m the first girl he&amp;#39;s ever brought the female dog around that she didn&amp;#39;t hate. I felt honored. But my god, are these dogs hyper. They had the energy of a 3 year old hopped up on an IV of mountain dew. The female slept in bed with us, something I didn&amp;#39;t like but tolerated. After all, the dogs were there before me. I didn&amp;#39;t mind the dog hair or the howling at first either. It was a little endearing. And seeing how much my boyfriend cared, that was heart warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started to realize the issues with these dogs. I noticed the dogs had crates, which I found to be shocking because we never crated our dog. Boyfriend tells me they HAVE to be crated, or else they eat furniture. I didn&amp;#39;t believe him at first until he shows me a picture. And I&amp;#39;m not talking about chewing a cushion, I&amp;#39;m talking the actually wooden base of the chair was gone. They ATE THE WHOLE CHAIR. But you know, your dogs. Whatever. So they are crated while he is at work. And he works decently long hours, leaving the house around 8 and getting home around 4 sometime later if he has work meetings. He also feeds them raw chicken. Not going to lie, that always grossed me out. And it was super expensive. They dogs were always very aggressive around their food. He would feed them roughly 5-10 pounds once a day, so they were always begging for food. And not in the cutesy sit in front of you and widen your eyes type of begging. More like actively try to take your food. Panting on your leg, running around the table in circles, barking, attempting to climb onto the table. I&amp;#39;ve always struggled with my relationship with food, so this was one of the first things to really wear on me. I couldn&amp;#39;t eat without literally being hounded. No matter how many treats I gave them or how much I shared my food, I could not eat in peace. So, we&amp;#39;ve now lost joy in eating. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved into the house, there was an extra bedroom that was completely empty, aside from some piles of dog shit and spider webs. I made it my project and turned that room into a walk in closet. I could not tell you how many times the dogs pissed and shit on the floor and on piles of our clothes. Definitely hundreds of dollars in clothing lost over time. And then there was the basement, oh the basement. Somehow, as much as the dogs shit and pissed everywhere else in the house, they still managed to sneak into the basement and piss and shit there. Boyfriend would clean it up often, but it would somehow ALWAYS be covered in more. It was to the point where we couldn&amp;#39;t have a plumber over because of what a horror show it was in the basement. He kept the dogs crates in the bedroom, which was also where he fed them raw chicken. So their  corner of the room was always a cesspool of raw chicken germs and husky hair. Gross. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the sleeping situation. As I said the female slept in bed with us. Now after however many years, these two dogs were NOT house trained. They peed or pooped in the house daily and nightly. I can imagine very few mornings where we didn&amp;#39;t wake up to piss and shit all over the floor. The female sleeping the bed was roughly 60 pounds and took up a lot of space. If I would accidentally or purposefully nudge her she would growl at me and get off the bed and sit on the floor and whine. Without stopping. Boyfriend would then have to spend a solid 15 minutes coaxing her back into bed. Only for the entire process to repeat the entire night. I have chronic cluster migraines and nothing triggers them more than lack of proper sleep. I lost countless nights of sleep and suffered in immeasurable amount of migraines from the whining. There were nights where neither of us slept. Boyfriend would take them out again and again and still it didn&amp;#39;t stop. I remember him breaking down in tears over it on more than several occasions. There wasn&amp;#39;t room for the male dog in bed so he slept alone on the floor and would make licking noises the entire night. I eventually lobbied to have the dogs not sleep out, and sleep in their crates. Boyfriend objected at first, he said it was mean for them to be in their crates all night and all day. But I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep with the three of us in the bed, the hardwood floor was becoming bleached of color from us cleaning the same dog piss/shit spots over and over again. The dogs being in the crates meant that the female would whine for a minimum of an hour before realizing she wasn&amp;#39;t going to get out and would stop. In that hour, we tried everything. Being quiet and ignoring her. My boyfriend tried yelling at them, singing to them, shushing them, and chastising them. None of it seemed to have any sort of result. Occasionally if you ignored the female for too long, she would start to bark and howl instead of just whining. In addition to all of this was the constant, rancid farts from their diet of only raw chicken. Often times, the raw chicken would make them sick if we got a bad batch. And we would have the two of them shit and vomit everywhere in the house. The house reeked of wet dog and dog vagina. This was my hell. I worked an hour away from home. And would drive to work in tears, exhausted and traumatized from night of whining and yelling, knowing that I had an hour of rush hour traffic ahead of me. I would consume ungodly amounts of caffeine and tell myself that I was strong enough, I could do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where being at home gave me anxiety. I would often times sit in my car for a good 10-20 minutes because I was putting off what was behind those doors. By the time I reached the side walk in front of the house, rampant howling and dashing around the house. The dogs would jump on me and bark and howl every single time I or my boyfriend came home. It gave me instant anxiety. Then they would do laps around the house, licking and smelling all of me and all of my purse/gym back/whatever it was that I brought home with me. Cooking, one of my and my boyfriend&amp;#39;s greater joys in life, was no longer enjoyable for me. Cooking with the dogs meant jumping, running circles through your legs, trying to steal food off the counter, trying to get into the garbage and being stepped on. The dogs broke my boyfriends toes on several occasions. And cooking without the dogs meant an onslaught of non stop yelping. You would think we were murdering them by not letting them into the kitchen. So I stopped cooking at all and let my boyfriend deal with the two hell hounds in the kitchen. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I was on the verge of an outburst just from not being able to operate in my own kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a stressful cooking and an even more stressful dinner, we would take the dogs for a walk. We didn&amp;#39;t have a fenced in back yard  (living in the city) and there was not a realistic way to fence it in, I swear. So, they were always confined to the house. They also though that escaping was a fun game. You could not have them off leash EVER or else they&amp;#39;d bolt. And I told my boyfriend each and every time not to run after them, that he was encouraging this habit, and I would NOT chase after those dogs or any dog ever. I was raised with the belief that if you have to cage up an animal to keep it from running away, than that animal isn&amp;#39;t really yours. Regardless, he would chase after them every time, saying he didn&amp;#39;t want them to get hit by a car or stolen. Walking them was terrible. All the did was pull and try to run or chase after anything and everything. The female always had to be walking faster than the male. She&amp;#39;d strangle herself in that pursuit. The male did not get along with other dogs, so we couldn&amp;#39;t take them to the dog park. Overall, walking them was terrible. I&amp;#39;d been knocked down, pulled, dragged, stepped on, you name it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a walk, you&amp;#39;d think they&amp;#39;d be tired but no. The female had some sort of separation anxiety. She would whine if she wasn&amp;#39;t given constant attention. And I mean constant. If you were not petting her, she was whining. I read up on the topic and told my boyfriend that we needed to not make a big deal of coming or leaving from the house, but he would always rile them up when he got home. Shouting &amp;quot;Huskieeeeeees!&amp;quot; And then howling at them from the second he would get out of his car. I&amp;#39;m sure the neighbors loved that. If the female was ever quiet, it&amp;#39;s because she was eating herself out. Like moaning and going to town on her own clit and asshole for hours. It was one of the most repulsive things to have to listen to and watch. The female was also very aggressive towards me. She would bark at me if I was kissing my boyfriend. Snapped at me on several occasions. Would take my seat when I got up and growl and snap at me when I came back and told her to move. We even got the dogs their own chairs, didn&amp;#39;t matter to her. If my boyfriend wasn&amp;#39;t giving her 100% of his attention all of the time, she was whining. I always assumed they stopped whining while we were at work after a while. But I asked the neighbors once and they said that the dogs would whine and bark the entire time we were gone. How no one ever called the police on us is a miracle. My boyfriend drives a 2 door corvette that the dogs do not fit in and that they are not allowed in. This means we were incapable of driving them anywhere. I let him drive them a few times in my car, only to have it  covered in dog hair, scratched up, and drooled all over. I told him I didn&amp;#39;t want them in my car anymore, and it wasn&amp;#39;t fair to expect me to, given that he didn&amp;#39;t want them in his car either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I tried. I tried to help my boyfriend with the dogs. To exercise them more and try to train them to have better manners. But it never worked. We just didn&amp;#39;t have the time or energy that these dogs needed. We both worked more than 40 hours a week and liked to travel and go out on the weekends. I didn&amp;#39;t understand why he&amp;#39;d ever signed up for this in the first place. It was, at it&amp;#39;s core, completely irresponsible. And after many sleepless nights and gourmet dinners stolen by the dog while I went hungry, I decided to have a more hands off approach. One, I needed it for my sanity. Two, I thought maybe the burden of all of this alone would wear on my boyfriend and make him see that change was needed. It sucked, we couldn&amp;#39;t stay out late without feeling bad or coming home to a crate of dog shit and shit covered dogs. We couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere overnight unless we found someone to stay at the house. These were my young years, and I felt like I was wasting them. Like I was dealing with responsibilities that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have until I had children. I couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere without the dogs following me. Not even to the bathroom.

If you ignored them and they didn&amp;#39;t howl, they would start neurotically licking the clothes you were wearing. There is nothing more disgusting than wearing a pair of jeans that is drenched in dog drool. They ate several pairs of my shoes whole.

The only comment I would make daily was to my boyfriend, telling him without fail that these dogs lessened the quality of my life and that I was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one day, after FIVE YEARS, I snapped. I told my boyfriend I couldn&amp;#39;t live with the dogs anymore. I told him I wasn&amp;#39;t making this an &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s me or the dog&amp;quot; thing. But that all I knew was that I could NOT live with those dogs.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, a week later. I ask my boyfriend if he wrote the bio&amp;#39;s. He says he&amp;#39;s too busy with work.

And that if he didn&amp;#39;t figure out a solution to this soon, I would start looking for apartments to rent. I could only sleep on friend&amp;#39;s couches for so long. I work an office job and I need to be a functional human being at my job. He begged me to come back home. I stood my ground. I said that I couldn&amp;#39;t. That I realized how screwed up the situation was and that I couldn&amp;#39;t subject myself to it any longer. I&amp;#39;d given him a month more of me living in misery and he&amp;#39;d done nothing.

That past month, I had an average of 3 migraines a week, I was miserable. I was barely sleeping, barely eating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I stayed at a friend&amp;#39;s house that night and me and my boyfriend went back and forth via text. I stood firm. I was not coming back until they were gone. And if that was going to take some time, he needed to let me know so that I could look for a temporary apartment. He thought I wanted to break up with him. When I vehemently explained that was not the case, he finally sent the text: &amp;quot;Fine, I&amp;#39;m taking them to the shelter then.&amp;quot; I think he expected me to tell him not to. But I didn&amp;#39;t. I told him to do that if that&amp;#39;s what he needed to do. He still never attempted to re-home them properly and ended up dropping them off at the local no-kill shelter. While I was BEYOND relieved, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel like this was the grand finale in what I viewed as an irresponsible owner. He told me it was the hardest thing he&amp;#39;s ever done. I asked if he wanted to me come back home that night and he said no. That he wanted to be alone. That really fucked me up. That was when I started to worry that we weren&amp;#39;t really on the same page about this issue. I came back home the next day to a very heartbroken boyfriend. I did feel bad, it hurt to see him so hurt. And I didn&amp;#39;t hate the dogs, I didn&amp;#39;t wish them any harm. I just wanted to be free of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was in January and we&amp;#39;ve had several arguments about it since. He&amp;#39;s accused me always having hating them and that I was plotting to get rid of them the whole time. And he&amp;#39;s been depressed and gaining weight. Part of me wonders if I miscalculated? Not about me. I know I am 1000000000 time better off without those dogs in my life. I don&amp;#39;t need coffee in the morning. I&amp;#39;ve had maybe two migraines in the past six months. But I&amp;#39;m really torn up about it. I can&amp;#39;t help but be split between two different narratives and I do&amp;#39;t know which one is the real one. Part of me feels like a terrible person. That I broke up a happy family, because I was the only unhappy one. That I should&amp;#39;ve played the martyr for longer. That I should have tried harder or been less demanding about them going so quickly. And then another part of me feels angry. Angry at myself for allowing my soul to be in such distress for so long. And angry at my boyfriend for not realizing the severity. I had told him for a long time that I wasn&amp;#39;t happy and that it was because of the dogs. Why hadn&amp;#39;t he heard me? Why hadn&amp;#39;t he seen the distress I was in? Why would he expect me to stay in that dysfunctional situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it get better? Or is this going to be what breaks us? We are now engaged but I feel this huge distance between us and I feel like it&amp;#39;s something I can&amp;#39;t talk to him about. Because part of me is still so angry and part of me is still so guilty. I feel like I&amp;#39;m the bad guy. And I feel like it was completely unfair of him to put me in the situation where I had to be the one to say that enough is enough. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t win. That I either had to choose between living with these dogs or in the shadow of these dogs. I just want to be free of them, completely. I don&amp;#39;t want to live with the constant reminder of them being gone. I just want to move on with my life. How do I do that? How do I get my now fiance over this slump? I want us both to be happy, together. And I feel like what made me happy, made him miserable. I told him that there isn&amp;#39;t a time line for grieving but everything feels so tense now. I hate seeing a dog, wondering if it&amp;#39;s going to trigger him. I won&amp;#39;t send him anything dog related. I just want to slip into an alternate reality where dogs never existed. Help.&lt;/p&gt;

Last resort alternative only...  This is a MUST - the dog MUST have somewhere to go to AVOID the smells - DO NOT POISON OR HARM.

1. Number One - From the Department of Redundancy Department - Politely talk to your neighbor.  If you messed up and have had angry words for the dog, write a nice letter.
2. A dog's sense of smell is \~50 times more ""attuned"" than ours.  Get yourself some of the smells dogs detest.  Vinegar (industrial, not grocery store), citrus bleach, boat hull cleaner (citrus), bleach, pure AMMONIA.  DON'T MIX ANY OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER.  Get yourself some solvent-safe bins (I used Rubbermaid standard dish bins)...  empty the contents into the bin.  Place them as close to the dog as you can.  Keep yourself safe too.  (Don't evaporate a gallon of ammonia in an apartment).  If you have a yard, a driveway, a fence, spray the fence.  DON'T MIX ANY OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER.  Use the wind to your advantage.  These smells also work for cats, rats, vermin, etc.

I bought my first house and out of SIX surrounding houses on 10K sq. ft. lots, FOUR harbored large dogs.  These dogs used to bark at me in MY OWN HOME!  I'd turn on the TV and I'd be barked at.  I'd flush the toilet and be barked at.

Now, with my clever scent hack, all dogs keep a perimeter.  Owners cross the street on the sidewalk and they have no idea why their dog suddenly wants to.  (Vinegar works as a weed killer, so, no one will be any the wiser...  there's nothing wrong with using vinegar on your yard!)  A dog who used to bark me at MY fence won't come within 30 feet anymore.  If you can smell it at ONE foot, the dog might be able to smell it at FIFTY.  Now, the dogs have one less thing to bark at, ME.

I digress, moving forward..

I had my child 2 years ago (almost, she's about to be 2). I've had my dog since 2011, when he was a puppy. This dog was my L I F E before I was pregnant and then had my child. I was obsessed. Pictures adorned my walls, my camera roll on my phone was 1000's of pictures of him. Suddenly, at the end of 2016 I discovered I was pregnant. It was almost instantly my feelings started changing. I had terrible morning sickness and the smell of his breath would cause me to go running to the bathroom. Hearing him pant would make me sick feeling. His fucking hair all over the place, it would throw me into a frenzy. Fast forward to the birth of my daughter. The moment we brought her home, I wanted him out of my way. I can't stand his hair on her clothes. I vacuum and sweep daily. He has become a nuisance in my life. My husband loves this dog. He knows I feel this way, though. I am very transparent in my feelings. Once this dog passes away there will be absolutely no more canines in this fucking home. I am so tired of juggling the responsibility.

On top of this..my daughter is changing so much. She is inquisitive, smart, can communicate her needs (the best she can). It's amazing to see her change from a screaming potato to a fellow human with thoughts. We can take her to see the entire world and she will appreciate it one day. The dog is a dog, never changing. He just is. It feels so good to get this off my chest.

I just don't really buy the whole ""talk it out with your neighbor before escalating things"" garbage.

Even if they suddenly did know from someone knocking on their door and telling them, I very much doubt it would change a thing as most pleas with the neighbor go unanswered anyway.

Only a certain kind of personality disorder (it's likely antisocial personality disorder) allows a public nuisance of their own doing to perpetuate and one of the traits of that disorder I've noticed is they are impervious to other's emotions and needs, obviously. Notice how that these same people are quick to victim-blame when their dog harms others physically and/or emotionally and then lack remorse at the same time? Someone that is not of that personality would likely never have allowed their dog to bark and annoy others in the first place anyway. As in, they are able to empathize. An action that most dog owners seem to lack the ability to do.

TL;DR: Trying to abate a matter outside of dealing with a higher authority with a person that has antisocial personality disorder or something similar to that, is most likely a waste of your time; they aren't going to be moved by your pleading.

In some regards I feel like I’ve been pressured into accepting the dogs that others insist are in any and all situations around me for so long that I became numb and complacent to it. My natural instinct about dogs was always dislike, they scared me as a child and they still do. I can’t exactly pinpoint why, other than I’m a mellow person that has an extremely visceral reaction when someone/something invades my space and looms over me.... which many dogs do.  I always cowered and hid from dogs.  I grew up in an area where many people had large slobbery “hunting” dogs and they regularly ran amuck around kids. Sometimes I would get cornered, barked at or lunged at, and it scared me shitless. I couldn’t handle that kind of over the top unbridled energy, still can’t!  Mind you, one of my chores was to sit on the back of my Dads truck feeding a herd of 200+ bison.  My two older bros would cut the twine off the bales and break it up, and me and my younger bro would sit by the tailgate and kick the hay off while the majestic herd nibbles along with us. So I wasn’t some pussy that feared all animals!  Coyotes, moose, badgers, cougars, bears, elk.... all regular visitors that didn’t scare near as much as the neighbors dogs!  Well... maybe Moose, lol.

So, when I get to college pretty much everyone one of my friends has some sort of pedigree hunting or herding dog.  Puppies from their uncles.  Except, they’re  not using them for said tasks, except maybe ten days in the fall... the rest of the time I’m living in these houses full of dudes with big ass pedigree dogs with no jobs. Horror mutts!!!  While we all come from ranching backgrounds, I’m the only one who’s, 1) female 2) likes cats 3) doesn’t regularly wonder about how to line up 3 junk cars, light them on fire and get enough speed and air to jump a near totaled Suzuki Sidekick over them.... but I digress...  (btw, all the aforementioned participants in said story now have PHDs, so no redneck trash jokes, plz).  Anyway, while these crazy dudes I lived with were actually very respectful to me and would clock a dude out for looking at me sideways, there was one area that they refused to respect me... dog turf!  They f*ing tortured me with those mutts!  They knew I wasn’t totally into the “dribble drobble drool” and “nutsack” aspect of it all, and oh man!  You better believe that they took every advantage to rub that in my face and laugh about it. One of my “friends” had a large white “birding” lab, drooled nonstop.  He would stick his index finger into the depths of that drooling gaping mouth and grab as much drool possible then they would hold me down and wipe the drool all across my face saying *dogs name* mustache and laugh hysterically at me!  It always pissed me off and sometimes it made me cry. Sometimes I would leave and stay in my parents guest bedroom because I was so mad about getting dog drool all over me. I once went on a camping trip with them, drove over 1000 miles and three states, only to have them halfway through through the drive stop at the top of a mountain pass and “surprise” (ie, two hold me down while one rubbed dog drool over my face)me.  They were assholes, I just didn’t get it at the time. 

Fast forward... I graduate and move to “the Big West Coast City”.  I have yuppie friends and I work nights as a Chef (but I’m really an artist guys, Really!!).

I actually can’t really complain too much about the dogs I walked, but the interactions I had with others at the dog parks... Straight up f***ing Bananas!!  I would walk little doggie in and immediately be pounced on by other nutters.  They never spoke to me, never said hello, just spoke to the dog and through the dogs... “Oh, hello cute Puggle, what’s you’re name?  What do your parents do?

Today as I was hugging my dad goodbye in my driveway after he dropped me off, we heard some barking going on across the street. My dad looked past me and said 'Is that dog attacking???!?'.  


I turned around and sure enough a f-ing stocky unleashed Rot was attacking a leashed dog being walked. The owner walking her dog did a really good job keeping the rot off her own dog, but he still got a few good bites in as the other dog cowered on the ground and screamed. The rot was LUNGING for this other dogs throat while the lady screamed and held her arm in front of his mouth, bless her soul. My dad pulled out of my driveway and headed towards the altercation, ready to blow this Rot's head off with his concealed carry, but the owner ran out of the house and pulled him off the other dog just in time (darn lol), while yelling ""He's not attacking!!"" over and over. My dad started cussing him out and calling him several different types of stupid. The amount of time it took this owner to retrieve his dog was off-putting...I think these country hicks leave their unleashed rot on their porch to chill regularly; I'm pretty sure the guy was inside when his dog left the porch to attack.  


I just moved here for the summer (staying with a friend) and now I have to worry about walking out my front door every day, and am too scared to let my kid roam the neighborhood now, so obviously I called the police immediately. They came by like 20 or so mins later, got my info, then went and talked to both the victim and the shit-owners. When the cop left, the guy caught me walking in my front yard and yelled at me to mind my own business. I just smiled at him and walked inside. Came back out to help my friend hang her clothes up outside and the dude is yelling across the street to our other neighbors about his dog ""not even attacking anyone"". I interrupted him and said ""Is your dog on a leash now??"" I said absolutely not will I mind my own business, your dog just attacked someone in front of my house. We ended up in a screaming match and I don't even remember what was said bc I saw red. All I remember is him telling me to go back to (my hometown), which I have no clue how he knew where I was from. For some reason this stupid country hick is angry at ME for reporting his dog attack. In hindsight I probably should have just let it go and said nothing, dog people are too idiotic to understand reason, but the cop ended up coming back to double check on me and I let him know what went down. He said if the guy says anything to me again he'll be charged with harassment...also got to see the dog warden in the guys driveway and I walked back into my house smiling.   


Hope I don't have to see these nasty people for the rest of the summer, but unfortunately they're front porch monkeys and I bike to work. I'm nervous the victim will not press charges since she's also a dog person and will probably pity the Rot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think my time seeing an attack was so soon, but here we are.  &lt;/p&gt;

Basically I hate how we live in a very spread out manner and how everyone has their own huge yard that is constantly cut and sometimes sprayed with pesticides/weedkiller which has resulted in a huge loss of native plants, I feel like we’re affecting bee populations (alongside many other bugs) because of it and animals like rabbits and deer having to live with us because we’re using up so much space is worse than them just being completely separated from us. Also sprawl results in people having to drive everywhere and pump carbon into the air constantly which harms everything. So my usual suggestion is to make a lot of suburbs a lot more denser (less yards, more townhomes, less driving) to promote the idea of humans living closer to each other and away from animals more so both can live in peace and not affect each other in a negative way, as well as other reasons as to why it’s better for the environment (like how it’s more sustainable). Either way, it’s out of good intention for both humans and animals (it’s completely fine with you disagree with me) and honestly, fuck having to drive everywhere and mow the lawn every week. 

NOW how that relates to dogs, every damn time I talk about this, people immediately shoot it down and bring up”sorry but I have dogs and they like having a huge yard to play in”, every damn time. I guess dogs are just more important than humans and the environment around us? Also speaking of this, dogs themselves kill an assload of native wildlife as well so can we not just have them running around everywhere? Just to clarify, rural farms dogs and everything regarding that is completely fine (rural areas themselves and the dogs are very useful for killing rats), this is just about how we apparently need to keep spreading out suburbs where the majority lives just to accommodate an animal that is not only an unimportant animal to our local ecosystem, but a detrimental invasive species as well? Cats are invasive too because they kill birds for example but in my experience, the owners can just keep them inside at least. So yea I value wild animals like bees and the topic of how we’re affecting them more than damn housepets and their entitled owners

Edit: want to point out that i’m mostly just talking about environmental benefits too, but don’t forget to think about all the other benefits that would come with moving away from a spread out car centric culture, but I guess all those benefits are less important than dogs and their happiness according to dog moms, like I said, just bizarre priorities.

4) Past story

1. Ok, so my neighbor is currently campaigning for reelection in a federal job. I get it, he is of importance, but he has this dog. The second time I met this dog, it lunged at me, and tore off my jeans, and tried to go again, but he grabbed its collar. After that, both he and his wife walked the dog on a leash for about a year. Recently, they started this trend of walking the dog on a leash, if they see me.
2. I have expressed my fear of dogs, and I thought they understood. Today however, I was on my way back from school, when I saw them walking down the street with the dog. The dog just popped out of their driveway, so I began backing up. When the neighbors saw me, the wife called ""keep walking,"". I was too scared to talk, so I lifted my backpack to try and let them know it was me. They didn't leash the dog, so I kept backing up. They kept after me for half of a mile, back to my mom's house (nobody was home). Then I stood in the backyard, crying, shaking, and struggling to retain consciousness    (I have passed out from dog encounters before)                                                                                                                    Ten minutes pass, but it felt like I was there for an hour, when I go to get back home, it turns out my dear neighbors were talking with other people out to get the mail. So I waited until they turned to go back home, which they did at a leisurely pace. That cursed dog kept on darting in and out of people's driveways, so I had no idea where it was. This incident happened two hours ago, and I am only just starting to recover. My leg and eye are still twitching.
3. They always brush off my ""cynophobia"" because ""I am doing just fine with him there"" and ""Linus doesn't bother you"". Which, I put on a front of being calm around dogs, and Linus does terrify me, but I know for a fact he can't get past the fence. Their dog growls at me while he is on a leash, but I like to pretend the owners can control him.
4. There was another time, when they walked their dog and I was on my way home from school, and the dog lunged at me, and so I beat it back with a saxophone, which is now a grimy and twisted hunk of metal, but it feels like it saved my life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick sections. 1) Neighbors&lt;/p&gt;

Then I stood in the backyard, crying, shaking, and struggling to retain consciousness    (I have passed out from dog encounters before)                                                                                                                    Ten minutes pass, but it felt like I was there for an hour, when I go to get back home, it turns out my dear neighbors were talking with other people out to get the mail. So I waited until they turned to go back home, which they did at a leisurely pace. That cursed dog kept on darting in and out of people&amp;#39;s driveways, so I had no idea where it was. This incident happened two hours ago, and I am only just starting to recover. My leg and eye are still twitching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They always brush off my &amp;quot;cynophobia&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;I am doing just fine with him there&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Linus doesn&amp;#39;t bother you&amp;quot;. Which, I put on a front of being calm around dogs, and Linus does terrify me, but I know for a fact he can&amp;#39;t get past the fence. Their dog growls at me while he is on a leash, but I like to pretend the owners can control him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was another time, when they walked their dog and I was on my way home from school, and the dog lunged at me, and so I beat it back with a saxophone, which is now a grimy and twisted hunk of metal, but it feels like it saved my life.&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are stuck living with my aunt and grandmother, who own six dogs between them. There are also three cats in this relatively small house, only one of which is ours. I don't wish death upon every dog I see, however I do not care for them as house pets if they're not properly trained/care for. We had two of them before we were forced to come here (finances/family drama) and we had to give them to the pound. The only reason we had them is because we took them from my wife's folks who literally beat and starved the damned things on the daily, along with diseases that arose from being outside permanently without proper care. They weren't bad, but their issues lost us sleep and money we couldn't afford, so we let them go. That being said, I know good dogs when I see them.

&amp;#x200B;

The dogs I currently live with are very ill-behaved, but my folks are dognuts that think they can do no wrong. And if they do wrong undeniably, ""it's just how they are, you can't control that/ you started it/ leave them alone, they ain't hurting nothin"". These dogs attack each other, bark at FUCKING EVERYTHING and are spoiled with human food way too much (my grandmother literally has to cook for them when she cooks for everyone). This house is very much a 'dogs before humans' kind of place. I hate it to my very core, and even more so because my family wasn't always like this.

&amp;#x200B;

The dog that I specifically have a problem with is malformed and literally retarded. He's a chihuahua (one of the most aggressive breeds) and his parents were never fixed. So after many litters that they couldn't care for at all, the mother was too old on the last litter to not have trouble. She nearly died, and thus Doodles the Afflicted was born. This dog is one of the worst I've ever seen.

&amp;#x200B;

Day one, my wife and I walk in and all of them bark for awhile and stop (some of them know/recognize us already so no big) except for the retard. He just goes, and goes, and goes, like a malfunctioning energizer bunny (can't bark too long without choking but keeps going anyway). We tried to be nice, wife's a dog person all the way and I grew up with a couple of these dogs so of course being human I'm going to offer that olive branch first. Tried feeding him, holding him, petting him, just accepting him in general. But he never stopped hating us, not for one second. He barks and barks every time he sees us in our own house. He's always waking us up. And they never do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

They seriously take up for this dog due to his affliction, and even accuse us of beating them when they act out. I can't say one word without being seen as a ~~dog hating~~ animal murdering psychopath. Now, it's gotten worse. He actively tries to bite us whenever we walk by my aunt or grandmother, since he's always following them and apparently very protective. But when they're gone, he shuts up completely and hides like a pussy. He won't do anything, not even bark, until they get back. But when they do, he gets more aggressive. His bites don't hurt, hell he can barely bite at all, due to his malformation his upper jaw sticks out farther than the lower jaw (looks funny as hell, like a rat-dog). But it's just a constant annoyance, and constant shame if we don't react with anything but love for the little fucker.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember how my wife loves dogs? Yeah, she despises this one, which is rare. I would've ended/kicked him to the curb already if it weren't for them, because I know he annoys them too, but they won't admit it. I do not understand dog people and this sense of obligation they feel to make everyone feel like they do, and I hate their unwillingness to take responsibility for a situation they allowed to happen. So my question to dogfree is simply this, what do?

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get rid of this nuisance legally and cleanly? I may or may not do the same to some of the others, but not all of them, however this house may soon be left to me and I'm tired of seeing it destroyed by neglect. I grew up here, it's hard to see it this way, and the time is coming soon for a tipping point in this drama. What is the best way to deal with this many dogs, in these conditions, as easily and quickly as possible? Also, sorry if this post isn't up to the Reddit standard or whatever, like I said first post and I haven't lurked much but feel as though I've found a community I can vent to and discuss with.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s more specifically about what to do about the owner and the upcoming confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

They are very wealthy and just bought a new 5000 square foot house that's beautiful and easily worth $5 million.  The inside is beautiful at first glance, but has some issues.  They have two small dogs.  Granted, these dogs are relatively well behaved and do not shed, but they are still dogs.  For some reason they are only trained to shit on pads, and there are about four out at a time on the main floor.  To my aunt's credit the house is still very clean, but it's offputting walking in through the large main entrance and eying the staircase, chandelier and marble floor, only to see a pad with dog shit on it.  The dogs are also not allowed in the basement or second floor, so they have doggy gates in front of the stairs.  This was a bit inconvenient for me since I sprained my ankle the day before I left.  To top it off, although the dogs are ""trained"" to pee and shit on the pads, I stepped in dog piss the day before I left.  

My uncle's house is the nicest house I've ever been inside and 99% of the country could only ever dream of living in, but it's effectively ruined by dogs.  I can only imagine what it's like for houses with dogs that shed all over the place.  As beautiful as my uncle's house was, I was relieved to pull into my own driveway in my humble house where there's no animals and I could walk around without looking down on the floor to make sure I wasn't stepping in shit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just got back from visiting my uncle and aunt in Southern California over the weekend.  They are very wealthy and just bought a new 5000 square foot house that&amp;#39;s beautiful and easily worth $5 million.  The inside is beautiful at first glance, but has some issues.  They have two small dogs.  Granted, these dogs are relatively well behaved and do not shed, but they are still dogs.  For some reason they are only trained to shit on pads, and there are about four out at a time on the main floor.  To my aunt&amp;#39;s credit the house is still very clean, but it&amp;#39;s offputting walking in through the large main entrance and eying the staircase, chandelier and marble floor, only to see a pad with dog shit on it.  The dogs are also not allowed in the basement or second floor, so they have doggy gates in front of the stairs.  This was a bit inconvenient for me since I sprained my ankle the day before I left.  To top it off, although the dogs are &amp;quot;trained&amp;quot; to pee and shit on the pads, I stepped in dog piss the day before I left.  &lt;/p&gt;

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bsps61/dogs_in_the_grocery_sprouts_farmers_market_salad/)

I got responses from corporate and the Health Department. Corporate more or less punted saying what their policy was (no dogs) but there is not a lot they can do about service animals or verification. They did not take responsibility for *not* asking the legal questions. Though, from the County Health report someone did eventually ask the owner and made them leave, or they lied to the inspector. I left before this happened.

*County health did a re-inspection which I found out cost the store $240/hour in fees; more or less wiping out their razor-thin profits from all of my purchases I've ever made there. Complaining costs businesses money, and is probably the only thing that will change their behavior.*

**From County Health/Dept. of Environmental Health Services**

&gt;Inspector Comments: COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION  
This purpose of this visit was to conduct a complaint investigation.  
&gt;  
&gt;NATURE OF COMPLAINT-PER THE COMPLAINANT-  
On 5/24/19, the complainant observed a ""small fuzzy"" dog being carried by a customer inside the deli and salad bar self-service area at food level.  
The complainant stated that the issue was brought up to an employee to question the health risks and if the animal was a service dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;OBSERVATIONS/FINDINGS-  
The manager was interviewed and the following information was given-  
The manager has heard of this complaint and received other complainants of a similar nature.  
Per manager, the complaint was resolved. The owner of the dog was asked if the dog was a service animal. The owner replied that the dog was not. After which, the owner complied to the employee's request to retain the dog outside of the facility.  
The facility currently has a policy in regards to allowing pets (non-service animals) into the facility:  
\- Service animals must be on a leash.  
\- The owner of the dog is asked if the dog is a service animal and if any certification is available.  
\- If determined not be a service animal, the animal must be retained outside of the facility.  
Signage is available on the front entrance/ exit doors of the facility notifying customers of their policy towards animals.  
At this time, no live animals were observed inside the facility.  
&gt;  
&gt;On this date, the manager was informed on the following information as pertains to service animals: - Pets are not allowed inside a food facility unless the animal is:  
1.) A service animal\*, or  
2.) A dog under the control of a uniformed law enforcement officer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Service Animal- Dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability, or that is training to do that work or perform those tasks. The work or tasks performed by a service animal include assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, and alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence or people or sounds. “Service animal” does NOT include any other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained. Animals that provide crime deterrent effects, emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work of service animals. Cal Code 113903.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Special certification or identification for service animals:  
Service animals are NOT required to have special certification or wear special identification like tags, collars, leashes, harnesses, or vests.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Animals that are NOT considered service animals:

2.) Dogs that are NOT trained to perform tasks for the benefit of individuals with a disability. This also includes dogs used for: Crime deterrent effects, Emotional support, Well-being, Comfort, or companionship.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Locations where service animals are allowed to stay:  
Service animals are allowed to stay with their owners in dining and restroom areas.  
Service animals are NOT allowed in areas where food is being prepared, unless the food is located in a: Self-service line, or Communal food preparation area such as a shelter or dormitory.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Exclusion of service animals:  
Allergies, fear of animals, and “no-pets” policies are not a valid reason for excluding service animals from a food facility.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Additional fees:  
A customer cannot be charged more money or additional fees because they have a service animal.  
&gt;  
&gt;A copy of ""Guidelines for Allowing Pets into Dining Areas"" and ""Service Animals and Food Facilities FAQs"" has been provided to the manager.  
&gt;  
&gt;This complaint will be closed.

**From Corporate**

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to contact Sprouts. No animals are allowed in Sprouts stores, with the exception of service animals. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) limits the questions that may be asked of customers that bring animals into our stores, and there are many valid services that a service animal can perform under the ADA that might not be readily apparent. For example, a dog may be trained to detect low blood sugar. If a customer indicates that their animal is a service animal, we may only ask that the animal be removed from the store under a limited number of circumstances, such as if the animal is out of its owner's control or if the animal is not housebroken.   
&gt;  
&gt;Nonetheless, we appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention, and we will continue to advise our team members to vigorously enforce our no animal policy in our stores in compliance with the ADA.   
&gt;  
&gt;We hope this provides clarification for you and sincerely hope that you will continue to make Sprouts a part of your healthy living journey.

It's a long story, but it was the most financially responsible decision for the three of us. We split all the expenses evenly, everyone contributes to chores and upkeep, and things are generally pretty good.

The only problem is my friend's dog. I don't know what breed she is and I don't really care. She has fucking problems. She barks at everyone and everything that moves. This dog has lived in this house with the three of us for almost a year, but still will not come close to anyone but her owner (and sometimes his family, but even that isn't a guarantee). We'll call her owner ""Bob"" now, for readability.

She sheds so much hair that we have to sweep the floor every two or three days to keep the house moderately clean (which only lasts for a few minutes).

She squeaks and whines every second that Bob is home and not giving her attention.

We have to keep all the doors closed so she doesn't go in the bathroom and drink from the toilet.

We have to keep random junk and boxes piled on the couch so she won't climb on it.

We can't leave her outside for more than a few minutes at a time because she barks constantly at the neighbors' pets (all of which never make any sound until she provokes them).

She eats and drinks obnoxiously loudly, and the only place we can put her water bowl is in the laundry room right outside my bedroom; we have faux-hardwood floors and she drools all over the place when she drinks. Water + fake wood = swelling. At least in the laundry room, she can't really damage the tile floor. Still, she's so loud when she eats that she wakes me up early every single morning. I had to adjust my work schedule so that I could stay up later at night in order to keep her obnoxious pacing and eating from waking me up minutes after I go to sleep; now she and Bob are in his bedroom most nights before my bedtime.

She literally paces in circles around the house in the evenings while Bob is home, and the constant clip-clop and tapping of her claws against the floor drives me fucking nuts.

Despite being so loud and barking at everything all the time, she's scared of almost everything. Not in a somewhat cute or funny way; it's just annoying. She won't eat without Bob standing behind her to protect her unless nobody else is around. She won't go outside unless you move away from the door, and often runs into the door or door frame because she's trying to go too fast and the door isn't completely open yet. She won't come back in unless Bob opens the door and waits for her. She runs from the vacuum, the broom, the mop...everything. It's pathetic.

Of course, on top of all this, she does all the other normal dog things too. Despite being repeatedly told and shown to stay out of the kitchen and dining area, she ""sneaks"" around the house trying to find a way to go lick the entire kitchen floor any time the tiniest crumb of food is dropped. She licks and eats random flowers and bugs outside, and has twice now shat her guts out inside the house after eating something fucked up that we didn't know about. She pissed all over Bob's bed one night because she refused to go outside to relieve herself before bedtime.

Best of all, she rarely ever listens to orders from anyone — including Bob — unless treats are involved, because she is solely food-motivated.

And look...to be completely honest, I don't even hate all dogs. Some well-trained small dogs can be super cute and fun to play with. This is different though. She's the textbook definition of a bad dog. Literally, the only thing she has going for her is that she hasn't ever attacked anyone. She's such an annoying and messy dog that she's making me hate one of my closest and best friends in the whole world, who otherwise is a fantastic roommate and an awesome person. I don't want to vent all this shit to him because I'd hate to piss him off and lose him as a friend; he loves this dog.

So I'm here instead. Screaming into the void of Reddit. Thanks for listening.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a house last year with my two best friends.

So I moved to a smaller than average pisstown. Before This, I lived in the Infamous Portland Oregon, that was my home town.

I thought I liked dogs. I realized I only tolorated one dog. I hate dogs. 


Anyway. Story:
I lived in a small apartment place. In a bad part of town, according to white people (Im mexican.) But that isnt the point. 

To me, home town bad part or not. 

And I had a neighbor. An old man (about 60) and his mentally unstable grown son (35) dead mother or something. Go figure. 

I dont know what was up with the grown son, he was just an immature asinine jerk when ever someone had any constructive critism, especially about his dogs (big surprize.) He told me once about NOT wanting to get institutionalized. He sometimes gave his old dad a hard time. We all wished he was institutionalized.

ANYWAY, THE SON OF A cheuffeur  HAD TWO PITS AND BABYSAT SOME UGLY BIG DOG. SO HE OFTEN LET THEM OUT OF HIS HOME, LEASHLESS, TO GO AND DO THEIR BUSINESS AND DIDNT CLEAN IT UP. THE GOD DAMN DOGS OFTEN, I REPEAT: OFTEN SHAT ON THE DOORSTEPS OF NEIGHBORS. 
WHO WOULD CLEAN IT UP CAUSE: MENTALLY UNSTABLE ASSHOLE×2 LARGE PITS= GOD DAMN SON OF A BITCH  

ok, caps off. 

He would often baby the shits, calling them Baby Girl. Personally, I find it DISGUSTING when grown men say baby girl. Its just... Nasty. But to a nasty gross dog? Get the fuck out of here: WE ALL WANTED TO EVICT THAT NEIGHBOR. HE GAVE US ALL MORE MICE AND EVEN YELLED AT THE LANDLORD FOR THE GOD DANN DOGS. 

Ugh, I hated some of my neighbors over the years. That guy too. 

He eventually got evicted BUT THEY BOTH ALWAYS HAD THAT ""im too good for this place"" ATTITUDE WHICH WE ALL HATED THEM FOR, EVEN MORE. 

Woops, I lied 😬 more caps.

I got help when I was an older teenager and I am 29 now. I got diagnosed and treatment too late so I could never work or anything and I developed severe housebound agoraphobia. Loud noises feel like my brain is exposing with pain from the sensory stimuli receptors and outwards. It's so hard to explain. I have weighted blankets as therapy but I can't use them well in summer.

I stopped being able to talk to my mom or going outside at all for years but I am trying very hard to overcome my agoraphobia. I suffer problems from wisdom teeth like severe pain so in the last two years I made myself go to my dentist after about 6 years  but 2 years ago it was too big of a step and my agoraphobia relapsed again. My dentist also died of cancer in that time which was upsetting. In November of the following year we were able to go back to get an xray and I was able to talk to my mom a few days every month but in February my pain got a lot worse. But despite that I'm up to seeing her once a week. I also talk to her a lot on the phone literally every day.



But now I have 5  dogs that people leave outside and will yap and bark at extremely high decibels. These dogs weren't always here. I coped with the first two because they were next door andnI could pet them. We also talked to our neighbours. The 2 behind me were extremely bad and would bark all the time but we talked to the owners and they put them on the other side of the house so that is somewhat solved except when I hear them inside. But then my neighbours across the street got another new dog and now they yap at the ones on the left of me that I can pet. But then I got a new neighbour last year who would bark randomly all the time. Then he moves out and someone with an equally shitty dog moved in. Meanwhile my health is getting worse and I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown despite autism therapy I am doing. I can't handle this last one.

But how in the hell am I supposed to move in this state. We did literally everything and my parents are building me a house somewhere else now. But I dont think I can cope with summer. I am hypersensitive to heat... and every sense you can feel. We talked to the neighbours and they let us put up bark machines and its still bad. Every day I have a sensory overload and live in fear.

It's not fair. Its literally torture. Every single time I make progress on my agoraphobia my neighbouts ruin it with their dogs. I'm not sure I'm going to make it unless O can drive again or go to my parents house but doing so risks relapse. I have very severe anxiety at my parents house for reasons I wont get into but also they have dogs. Not to mention the major risk of relapse by having to move but Inhave no other choice.


What also pisses me off about my newest neighbour is that they randomly play extremely loud music. And we talked to them and they said they have their dog for their daughters therapy and they have someone with autism on their family. But O think she was full of shit or something. Idk.

It's a good show, but there was one thing about it that bugged me from a dogfree perspective.

[minor spoilers]

The show is very graphic in the way it portrays people dying of radiation sickness. It's a horrific way to die, and we see that up close in some very disturbing scenes that show pain, suffering, and the terrible way that exposure to radiation destroys skin.

And then comes a storyline about how during the evacuation, it was decided they would send hunters in to shoot and kill animals. The thinking was that the animals had become radioactive, and if they were free to roam they would expose people outside the evacuation zone to radiation.

The hunters had to kill a lot of dogs, some strays and some pets who had been left behind by people who evacuated, and what was striking to me was how the makers of the show decided not to show the dogs actually being killed. They would just show the hunters point their guns and fire, but not the deaths of the dogs.

The contrast was striking: Show a human being in horrific, agonizing pain as he dies of radiation sickness? No problem. Show a dog dying? No way.

I guess the people who made the miniseries calculated that their audience has a higher tolerance for pain and suffering of human beings than pain and suffering of dogs. Sadly, they may have been right.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HBO recently aired a miniseries called &amp;quot;Chernobyl&amp;quot;, dramatizing the 1986 nuclear disaster.

&lt;p&gt;I guess the people who made the miniseries calculated that their audience has a higher tolerance for pain and suffering of human beings than pain and suffering of dogs. Sadly, they may have been right.&lt;/p&gt;

I was watching some videos of cute reptiles with my SO a couple of days ago, when a clip of a small tortoise interacting with a dog popped up. I was visibly upset by it, while my SO was just enjoying the cuteness.

Our conversation went like this:

""That ain't cute, that's dangerous."" I said.

""Nah, the dog would never harm it. See how calm it is?"" 

""I got countless pics of ""calm"" dogs deadly harming tortoises to show you if you want. They are just chew toys in the eyes of dogs.""

He thought about it for a second and ended up agreeing with me.

While seeing dogs interact with small animals such as tortoises might look cute, to the dog that poor animal is nothing but another chew toy. I see too many pics of poor tortoises with their shells pierced everyday along with the owner's comment ""I don't know how this could happen!!

Ones that make you go “how could anyone WANT that, let alone think it’s cute?!”

A couple of days ago my roommates girlfriend brought her dog to our house while they planted grass out in the backyard. No big deal, until they were done and brought her dog, his, and my boyfriends inside. Now this girls dog isn't your typical, 60 lb lab-like brick head dog. She's some sort of English Mastiff cross. Cue the *slop slop slop* at the water bowl and current of slobber being dropped all over the floor. She was at LEAST 120-130 pounds and paced around the house shoving her head in your face and covered EVERYTHING with this nasty, bubbly saliva that I found while cleaning the next day dried into brown dust all over the couch and floor. Her eyelids and lips sagged to the point where her eyes dripped fluid and her mouth looked like a flap of flesh hanging off, and when she breathed her whole body shook and she just smelled awful. She was just about as ""well behaved"" as any dog could be - mostly just paced the floor staring at everyone, barked when the front door opened, and stood watching you eat while creating a puddle of drool on the floor. If she got in your way and you bumped her with your leg she'd jump and startle like you'd just hit her. Also, I have to include the fact that she has hip dysplasia and has already had surgery to fix one of her leg joints. 

Now don't get me wrong - pugs, french bulldogs, teacup chihuahuas, dachshunds, etc. are the awful results of horrible breeding and should not even exist - But, it seems that sometimes larger breeds wow people with their size and ""majestic nature"" and completely slip under the mutated-abomination radar. I personally think big, wrinkly dogs such as mastiffs are equally as horrific as smaller breeds - they are so heavy and are prone to so many health problems and usually only live to be 8-10 years old. I've heard that even just over-walking/over-exercising these dogs can be detrimental to their health. I can't imagine subjecting myself to such filth and sensory overload (noise, smell, and looks lol) in exchange for the company of some big, stupid dog.

I was walking back to a friend's apartment at night over the weekend, where I had parked my car. It was in a city I'm not familiar with, in an area without many pedestrians. On the way, I passed a man with a big, beefy dog on a leash - a leash that clearly wasn't properly made for leading a strong and heavy dog. It looked like two pieces of rope tied together, and it was really long, like maybe 10 feet long, meaning that there was a lot of slack in the leash and literally no way for the owner to pull back on the dog and keep it under control if it decided to jump on a passing stranger. 

Obviously, being both scared of big dogs and rationally cautious around animals that could possibly injure me, I gave the dog a wide berth - meaning that the owner could visibly tell that I was avoiding it. ""Oh man, she wouldn't hurt you!"" 

What drives me crazy is how many dog owners say that, without critically thinking about the fact that for MOST dog attacks, the owner always thought their dog ""would never do that!"" I don't care that your dog was a pit bull, I'm not a ""dog bigot"", I just value my health and safety and actively choose not to put myself in harm's way. And if you have a big dog, even if the dog has never shown a history of violence or aggression, even if your dog is a freaking golden retriever, you should never have a leash that doesn't enable you to control your dog if needed. 

And finally, if someone avoids your dog on the street, don't fucking guilt trip them into a sense of false security. It is never a bad thing to be generously careful. Your dog could have been a pug puppy and there would have been absolutely no harm done in me avoiding it on the street.

It was an all day thing so my girlfriend and I decided to go a little later once some of my other coworker's were off from the night shift. I totally forgot they had a dog and forgot to warn my girlfriend as both she and I have very mixed feelings about dogs. She used to work as a bather at PetSmart and has plenty of horror stories about dogs lashing and trying to bite her. So naturally she is a little afraid of dogs. We both have also had bad encounters with dogs in the past to feel uneasy about them. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing at all but we both feel extremely guilty about not really being 100% in love with dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

We arrived and walked in through the front door and there was already a bunch of my coworkers there sitting on the couch or standing around the kitchen because everyone made a ton of food. I walked through a small crowd of people by the front door and was immediately surprised to hear a scream and a growl. I turned around and the dog of the house was on his hind legs and literally in my girlfriend's face. I didn't think it was that bad at first and thought that he just jumped on her as some dogs do. Everyone started making excuses for the dog that he's ""stressed out from all the people around."" as if that's not a sign to maybe put the dog away for a bit in another room so he doesn't freak out? After asking her if she was okay I could tell she wasn't. About 30 seconds later she asks where the bathroom is and disappears. I was a little worried about her but figured she'd be fine if she just collected herself a bit. While she's gone for maybe a minute the dog walks up to me and sniffs my leg which naturally started to make me a bit nervous. He then immediately jumps up and goes to get in my face. Everyone's reaction was about the same and a couple of my coworkers started babying the dog as if something bad happened to *him*. I was a little irritated at that point as I was worried about my girlfriend's well-being while everyone babies the dog and acts like he did nothing wrong. Not too long after that one of my coworkers kept on making excuses for the dog but I didn't really pay much attention because I think it's a little unacceptable. Later on she told me that the dog's teeth physically touched her face and it shook her a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend then texted me that she was in the bathroom in tears because she's terrified of the dog, she didn't even want to come out of the bathroom. I went in to try and comfort her and see what she wanted to do, but she felt bad about being scared and didn't want to leave the party in fear of being ""that one person that leaves because of the dog"" which I really feel is a pretty shitty way to feel. She asked me if we could maybe see if they could put the dog in another room for a bit but she and I both had a feeling that it wouldn't go over well. I let her stay in the bathroom a bit longer because when I peaked out to check where the dog was he was just kinda sitting in the hallway near the bathroom so I knew she couldn't leave. I walked out back to the party for a minute when someone else asked me if she was okay. I replied ""not really she's terrified of the dog"" and they just couldn't wrap their head around why that would be. Hmm.... They seemed to finally understand where I was coming from when I briefly explained how she worked at PetSmart where dogs would literally lash out and try to bite her and she probably had some mild PTSD. That shut them up. We ended up being able to break away with some coworkers that I had made plans with that day to smoke at the party with. No one really checked up on her or offered any solutions to make her feel comfortable at the party and it kinda made me a little irritated with most of my coworkers that I've known for years.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in this situation? It was really hard to deal with when no one wants to take any initiative to put the dog away and instead baby it and ignore the person who is terrified and upset. I do like dogs for the most part but I recognize that they aren't people and that the culture has really gotten out of control when people who aren't necessarily in love with dogs feel uncomfortable and unsafe.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night it was one of the bartenders at the restaurant I work at&amp;#39;s birthdays.

This is my first post on reddit so I apologize if I make any mistakes in terms of what to post, tag etc. I’ve been stalking this forum for a bit and figured I’d bit the bullet and post something. ANYWAY!

My partner and I live with a roomate who recently adopted a dog. I didn’t realize at the time how difficult it would be or I wouldn’t have said yes to it. There’s a lot of different things that happen so I apologize if this post is a bit disjointed. 

The first few months the dog barked at EVERYTHING, open the door, it barked, got some water, barked. After a month of training the dog barks significantly less and is all around an ok dog. Well that is until it sees my cat. If the cat comes near the owner the dog FREAKS, barks and lunges at the cat. Every single time. But this time was the worst. Usually she (the roomate) will take dog in her room but instead grabbed it while she was sitting on the couch and let it bark and bark. Not the normal dog bark, the im gonna kill you I’m sure you all have heard.  The cat in distress runs way. I already don’t feel completely comfortable with the dog around the cat now I feel completely uncomfortable. 

Some other things is our roomate tried to insert her dog into everything. My friend was over and we were talking about my cat and she was like ‘well Frannie (her dog) did xyz’. It seems to be she’s trying to constantly one up everything in regards to her dog and my cat. Like every time I have a friend over she will bring the dog out of her room where she usual is and say Frannie wanted to say hi. When she does that she lets Frannie Jump on my friends, to the point where they have been scratched. Most of my friends love animals but it gotten bad. 

Yesterday my friend  was over and Frannie kept jumping on her as she does when anyone comes over. My roommate did little to stop the dog even when my friend  spoke up about it.  We work together and she told me she doesn’t feel comfortable coming over because of the dog. 

On top of all that she tries to put her dogs stuff ( example, the dog bed)  allll over the apartment. There is no room in the house except our bedroom that doesn’t have dog stuff cluttered int in.  Also there is dog hair EVERYWHERE and she doesn’t clean it up.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had enough and my boyfriend and I are speaking with her tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

That's what it fucking is.  You didn't rescue jack shit.  You didn't find it in a burning building or a treacherous river. You went to a person and paid money and acquired a dog, and there is a very decent chance you did it because it was a ""bargain"" compared to the cost of acquiring a pure-bred dog from a quality breeder.

I grew up in the 80's, and I guess the dog rescue movement existed back then, but even if you did *purchase a dog from a rescue group*, you weren't enough of a turd to actually characterize this as you ""rescuing"" the dog.   No. You adopted it, albeit from a rescue, but it was essentially just an adoption from a more kush environment than the pound--the foster home. To not only portray you acquisition of an animal through exchange of money as a ""rescue,"" but to constantly refer to the dog as ""a rescue"", just so everybody can fucking know--just STFU with that nonsense.  It's a dog that you ""got.""  

And having the stupidity to pay money for a *dangerous dog* which has been rejected repeatedly because it can't play well with others or attacks stuff does NOT make you a ""rescuer."" Quite the contrary, it just makes you a fucking stupid vector for destruction and suffering by bringing that beast around the rest of the civilized world.  It's like purposely ""saving"" deer ticks and bringing them into suburbia with no concern for the lyme disease, and then having the audacity to pat yourself on the back for ""helping."" Somebody needs to rescue such people form their own stupidity.

For fuck's sake.  Even people who adopt human beings out of terrible situations, even medical professionals who adopt the abandoned premie baby with serious disabilities because her parents were drug users who couldn't deal with it--even these people do not have the audacity to refer to what they've done as ""rescuing.""  

It's actually a purchase.  But I get it.  You can't insinuate that you *acquired* a dog these days without being attacked, so you damn well better use the term ""adopted"" or much better still ""rescued""--even if it's not true, just to avoid the pitchfork brigade.  So fucking stupid because quality dog breeders create quality dogs in the aim of them never ending up in shelters, but they get labeled as the bad guys--when it's really the shitty casuals who can't be bothered to spay, neuter, or even restrain their mutts, littering our country with unwanted beasts which must then be ""rescued"", who are responsible for the vast majority of basically varmits you see polluting every neighborhood in this country.  Somehow we made it evil to be a responsible and conscientious dog owner, and we now glorify people who help to perpetuate absolute shit breeds (pits, every-fucking-where)

It would be far more accurate to describe it as a ""rescue"" if you saved the dog from a shelter that actually euthanizes because of overcrowding.  But every fucking rescue I've ever heard of, the actual person who finally gets the dog (and refers to it as them ""rescuing"" it), got the dog from a person's home where his life was never in any danger.  I mean, I guess you could say that those who home these dogs temporarily, having picked them up from kill shelters, sort of ""rescue"" the dog.

I’ve noticed in the last few years people have really, really strong relationships with their dogs. I think it’s great that they care so deeply about their animals - I get it totally, I have cats and horses.

But am i being an asshole or does anyone else notice them trying to humanize behaviors or mistake them for something that they aren’t? And letting them just kind of do whatever they want with no real obedience training? I think I’m more aware of it because having horses for the last 10+ years, you have to understand their body language and how they think / work. You have to, with 1,000+ lb animals and you constantly have to be seen as the leader without question. I would never defend another horse owner or horse that acted poorly or dangerously - I’d tell them nip that shit in the bud, ASAP.

Ex: Facebook post where a dog is “crying” over a deceased owner...I pointed out that it clearly had eye problems and needed to see a vet and several people got mad, and said no the dog was sad and crying. Like several thousand people that thought a dog cries like a person?

For example, when I used to go by my uncles house his dog would put its paw over my arm. I’d correct it and say 1. I don’t like a dog jumping / touching all over me and 2. That’s a dominance behavior. He would shrug it off and say no it wasn’t, she’s a good dog?

A few weeks ago I’d commented on Facebook about being chased and bitten by a pit bull that was unleashed at a local nature park years ago. I was there running, when I ran past it and it gave chase and bit me. Several people said I clearly did something to make it bite me...Why won’t they take responsibility for their animals behavior?
 
 I was walking one of our cats on a harness (weird cat lady, i know) in my sister in laws yard the other day a woman was walking a GSD. When I waved, she ignored it. My cat got scared when it noticed the dog so I picked him up to go inside. Then she said “My dog hates cats.” Like...Okay? That was kind of a really rude thing to say, especially considering we were no where near and not bothering you.

Im sorry for the rant, this just seems like the place. I try to like dogs, but with the owners rampant entitlement and assumption that everyone else likes them, combined with not training them at all it’s really frustrating.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.

&lt;p&gt;For example, when I used to go by my uncles house his dog would put its paw over my arm. I’d correct it and say 1. I don’t like a dog jumping / touching all over me and 2. That’s a dominance behavior. He would shrug it off and say no it wasn’t, she’s a good dog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I’d commented on Facebook about being chased and bitten by a pit bull that was unleashed at a local nature park years ago. I was there running, when I ran past it and it gave chase and bit me. Several people said I clearly did something to make it bite me...Why won’t they take responsibility for their animals behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking one of our cats on a harness (weird cat lady, i know) in my sister in laws yard the other day a woman was walking a GSD. When I waved, she ignored it. My cat got scared when it noticed the dog so I picked him up to go inside. Then she said “My dog hates cats.” Like...Okay? That was kind of a really rude thing to say, especially considering we were no where near and not bothering you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sorry for the rant, this just seems like the place. I try to like dogs, but with the owners rampant entitlement and assumption that everyone else likes them, combined with not training them at all it’s really frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

First and foremost, ***this is Dogfree.  The prevailing opinion is that dog people suck, dog culture sucks, and DOGS SUCK THE MOST.

As far as we moderators are concerned, we don’t have any plans to change the way that we moderate this type of content, and this is largely for the benefit of the community as a whole.  Currently, as our sidebar and FAQ post state, dog owners who wish to participate in good faith are not disallowed.  We remove disrespectful, troll-ish activity; things you find in the [Dogpile](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/b7f82k/the_dogpile_dogfree_outtakes/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bs5xs1/the_dogpile_part_two/).  We remove content put forth by dog owners who don’t seem to want to give it a rest or by those who seem to show a general disrespect for our space; our threshold for this is lower than you may perceive.  

What we don’t want to do is overmoderate.  We sometimes feel overbearing enough just in enforcing the rules already on the books.  If we were to start moderating things on the basis of “I don’t like that,” then we stifle conversation and run the risk of overmoderating in general, making up arbitrary rules and drawing arbitrary lines as we go. If we ever found ourselves in a position that dog lovers are overtaking our sub, drowning us out, or making us feel like we can’t express ourselves freely, then yes, we’ll definitely take a more aggressive approach.  That is the last resort. 

What we ask of this sub is to remember that our mantra is “people before dogs.”  Yes, dog owners are part of the problem, but they are also people.  They are people who have come to our sub looking for a unique take or a unique form of support on a dog-related issue that they won’t find elsewhere.  It is fair game - encouraged, even! - to call them out or to engage in discussion that might challenge their thinking.  However, we can do this in a [kind, civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/8tj6b3/mod_message_lets_stay_civil/) manner.  

On the minority of posts that we’re referencing here, we can achieve a balance.  Honest discussion is healthy.  Civil debate is interesting.  Finding common ground is constructive and might just lead to some small change in this world which, at the end of the day, is what we are after.  

As we have watched the conversation evolve over the past couple of days, we have observed a variety of opinions about whether or not people who preface their posts with “I love dogs but” should be welcome in the first place.  Even within our own sub’s constituency, we have a wide variety of opinions on all matters, both meta and dog-related.  At the end of the day, the larger we grow, the harder it is to make this sub everything everyone wants it to be.  It’s not a one-size-fits-all sub and never has been; if it could be, believe us, it would be.  We’re all going to have to give and take a little, learn when to engage and learn when to simply scroll.

Just know that we mods have your back.  We’ll never let the sub get to a point where the boldface statement above doesn’t apply.   We can still offer support to people who aren’t 100% dogfree while simultaneously maintaining a place where we can vent and discuss our opinions freely. 

For our own information, please click the link below to take a quick 30-second survey.  We’ve heard from a vocal bunch, but for our own purposes, we’d like to know where this sub as a whole stands on this issue.  We can’t promise any immediate changes, but it will help us in making decisions as to how we approach moderating this sub in the future.

Then, it started barking. ""Sorry, he usually never barks unless he wants attention. He's very quiet unless there's people around."" (Sure, Jan, I believe you). 

Then the other people around the table: ""Oh, don't apologize, you never have to apologize for a dog!""

""It's just barking. He could bite me and I wouldn't need you to say sorry!""

""Hell, he could *kill* me and I'd just be like, what a great way to die!""

I am a new user to reddit and I am so glad that this sub exists. I need to let my store out of my chest and hopefully get some advice and comfort here because people here seem really logical. The other dog subs scare me to be frank with you. 

Please bare with me. This rant is going to be long and disorganized. 

Ironically I am actually an animal/dog lover and I work in the veterinary field. ( I do also totally understand that not everyone likes dogs and it’s totally ok because People have their preferences! ) When come to owning a dog, I do have preferences over the breeds and temperatures of the dog. I currently have two dogs and a cat. My older dog is really a well behaved, low-maintenance and quiet dog which is perfect for me. The other one is obnoxious and I am pulling my hair out. 

So the store goes like this. My sister in law ( husband’s sister) is the most irresponsible and lazy person I ever met. She insisted on getting this female pitbull mix puppy when she has no job, two young kids and her partner can’t make ends meet either. She refused to take any time to walk and take care this puppy. Puppy was locked in her garage for 4 months straight and she picked up a tons of bad habits along the way. We ( husband, mother in law and me) tried to have conversations with her about the dog but she got offended and wouldn’t talk to us again. 

Then after a year, she moved out of California out of sudden and we found this poor dog ended up in one of the high-kill shelters near our city.

Husband was concerned about her safety in the shelter and wanted to bring her home ASAP. I agreed with him. The puppy seemed savable and I would like to offer her a chance to be later REHOMED. Yes. REHOMED. 

Before husband headed out to the shelter to pick her up, I talked to him about some expectations I would had while the dog is under our temporary custody.

First of all, I told him that she is only going to be with us temporary. After she adjusts and is ready for a new home, we would arrange something for her. I mention this because my husband is a huge pitbull fan. He met the puppy before and I am sure he probably would want to keep her if given opportunity. But I really couldn’t take in another dog especially a young dog of high energy breed. I simply don’t have the time, energy and patience for it. I am a part time student preparing for veterinary school. I go to schools for 3 days and work 4 days and I am not even joking.

Secondly, I know this sound super selfish and stupid but I am picky about the breed and temperature of the dog I would have. I prefer health-looking and agile dogs.Brachycephalic breeds like pugs, bulldogs, pit bulls won’t  be my choice not only because they have a tons of health related issues. I just simply don’t find their features appealing.  I told husband that this is another reason that I cannot have this dog permanently because I know I won’t enjoy her. He seemed understanding.

Lastly, I asked him to keep the dog downstairs ( carpet upstairs) and off the furnitures because I knew from experience that she won’t be housebroken and probably has a lot of behavioral issues that need to be fixed gradually.

Ok. He agreed and off he went. He brought home this scared poor dog that just won’t stopping peeing all over the place. Wow. The situation was worse than I ever imagined. Husband insisted on being the dog upstairs to sleep with us for the first night because he believed that she was traumatized. And for sure, More accidents upstairs on carpet. I was upset and husband gave me this suck it up attitude that made everything worse. Dah! I know it’s not the dog’s fault that she pees everything. But what I can do. I am a woman and I do get upset when I smell urine on my carpet.

That is just the first night. I became more and more frustrated because the dog is soooo hyper/barks at wind/destructive/licks everything and leave slobbery smell all over my house/ still has a lot of accidents here and there/actually smell horrible 3 days after bath etc and my husband is not helping either. I am angry at him for his nasty “ too bad” attitude and for him refusing to rehome her unlike what he preciously agreed. He SPOILS her so much. Right after I disciplined her for licking the couch non-stop, husband budges in and start petting her and scolding me for being mean to her. That’s a fucking positive reinforcement for unwanted behavior. It’s making it so difficult for me to discipline. 

So now the dog drives me bloody mad unless she is laying down and not whining or panting or drooling. It has been a while and I don’t think things will get better. For example, In the car, she is even worse. She is so fucking excited at the road and she is pacing back and force on the back seat and barking at air. Even the car seat cover won’t protect the leather since she is moving so much and fold the cover onto itself. It hurts me to see the back of my beautiful brand new Tesla model 3 looks dirty and dusty and just disgusting. My house is  a mess too. I have little time picking and cleaning after her and husband doesn’t seem to be bothered by the mess. I am seriously stressed out by all of this.

Errrr. Thank you so much for your patience. That’s a lot of venting.

I have talked to my husband. He basically thinks that I am this unloving unmotherly crazy women that has no compassion for animal. 

I have reached out to friends and family. None of them seems to understand the stress And since a lot of my friends are dog lovers, I feel like I am being judged. 

However, deep down, I don’t think having preference for dogs you have to live with is wrong. The dog does not match with my life style. She made me miserable.I am torn apart because I feel guilty for not liking a dog for some petty reasons like noise and smell.
I am torn apart because I blame my husband for neglecting my feelings, however I don’t not want to hurt him since I knew he has bonded with her and forcefully removing her would cause trauma to the relationship. 
This is driving me insane.!!

If you had similar experience I would love to hear your advice. Generally I would appreciate all feedbacks from everyone!

Thank you again for letting me venting here.

First, SuperMarioLogan.

I know he's controversial and all, but this is relevant, because I saw him make some nice little jabs at pit bulls and their advocates.

In one video, he has Craig, the Devil of the SML universe, decry All Dogs Go to Heaven, having him state ""That movie is bullshit! You think a pitbull that mauled a five year old is going to heaven? Not likely!""

And in another video, a character ends up accidentally creating a Piranha Plant that acts very much like a savage, aggressive dog. It's impossible to control, it's constantly snapping and biting at people, with clear intent to kill, and though I could be remembering wrong, I'm fairly sure it did actually end up killing two characters. The cops are called to shoot the Piranha Plant dead, and Bowser Junior, like a classic pitbull nutter, hops on a soapbox and starts making a speech about how the plant deserves another chance to prove it can love...only for the plant to immediately start mauling him halfway through the speech, causing him to plead for the cop to shoot it. I'm fairly certain this is meant to be an analogy for pitbulls and their stockholm syndrome induced owners.

I doubt many of you guys know or like SuperMarioLogan, but it is nice to know that a YouTuber I enjoy understands pit bulls are bad.

On a similar note, a Lets Play channel called OneyPlays had the main host, Chris O'Neill, openly, freely and shamelessly admit that his dog was completely and utterly unlikeable until he successfully trained it. Don't remember the playthrough, but it stuck with me because he at the very least gets that untrained dogs are literally vermin.

When she moved in with me and left her old dogs at home, I knew this day was inevitable.

Naturally we “adopt” a pit-bull.  He’s only allowed in the living room and kitchen, but he started climbing on the couches and she absolutely adores him.

First night with him I get serious sinus issue and notice crust forming in my eyes.  Now my eyes feel like they’re constantly swollen.  The worst part is that I’m not sure if it’s allergies or the lack of sleep I’m dealing with.  Since she leaves early and comes back late for work a few days a week, I’m the one left taking care of him morning and night.

Last night I had to take him out in a thunderstorm to relieve himself.  Then I wiped down his smelly dog body while he proceeded to still track dirt all over the beautiful hardwood floor.  I’m sure his nails will make sure that any finish disappears off the floor in no time.

Then I lay on the couch trying to relax while he continuously tries to jump up with his damp paws.  Then he decides to chew some pillows instead of his bone, so I have to distract him to stop.  I end up rewinding a show 5 times because I can’t have more than a minute before he does something stupid.  Finally he jumps on the table from an ottoman before I’ve had enough and crate him.

I used to love coming home after a long day, now I’m pissed off wondering when this will all be over.  The living room smells like dog, a smell I can’t stand.  And I can’t walk barefoot anymore since my feet stick to the floor and hit random pebbles he tracks in.  I used to leave the shoes at the front door, now I invite the dirt to where I live.

I’m still trying to figure out the appeal and to love this thing, but I don’t get it.  He does dog things and exists.  They’re not aww! cute! to me.  They’re the behaviors of an animal that wants to be outside.  My GF gets lonely and scared when she’s home alone, I do not.  I really don’t get any happiness from this dog.  His “unconditional love” is granted to any owner who feeds him, what’s the point?

(I'll use gender-neutral ""they"" here because, tbh, it really doesn't matter for the point, but if anyone cares - was a girl, and so am I.)

So a while ago I sorta hit it off with someone on Tinder. Got along pretty well for the first text messages exchanged, and when it came to the ""So, when are you free?"" part, they mentioned they'd have to see when they can get someone to take care of their dog first.

...first red flag, but I didn't want to be a total ass. For all I know, and I did not ask because I don't want to enable dog nut convos (I really don't care), it could have been a relative's dog they took in temporary, or something. Went ""all right, just hit me up"" and did keep texting.

A day later came the second red flag - a very insecure, easily ""the wrong word might just give me a breakdown"" triggered person, in their words. Possibly exaggerated, but before proof, I tend to believe people what they tell. My mind pretty much went ""ESA...?"" at that. Or just living baby blanket, same thing. Ouch.

The third red flag was when shallow conversation topics got hard to keep a chat going and I asked for their hobbies - *none*. That's a major red flag in general imo, because if I was a fan of people who have nothing really to spend their time with, I could just bond with my plushies. (Hint: One of my preferences is person with an own life, not dependent on me 95% of the time)

So at that point told them I'm not interested and deleted her number and everything.

Honestly? It would be a lie to say I'm not somewhat bummed out. (I'm ""cursed"" with very bad luck in my non-existent love life, so not gonna lie, it was a harder decision than it should have been lol)
But in the end, thinking rationally about it... It was the right decision overall, definitely, and I'm not just telling myself that to feel better.

Ideally a date would lead into a relationship, and you cannot have a relationship with someone who has a pet and 100% avoid the pet. Even if you do not visit them, they have the fur or anything on them. Or bring it, if dog, for a surprise visit to make you change your mind. Or guilt-trip you into accepting the dog.
And I wouldn't.

The alternative? A partner giving up their pet for you, and honestly, that's nothing I'd approve of either. I would drop a person who'd expect me to just drop a hobby of mine because they simply don't like it, because those things are part of my life. I don't really want to be that much influence on someone and their decision. It'd also feel kinda manipulative and toxic, tbf.

If it's a pet that was gotten after getting together, though, that's different and *should* be rehomed if one person doesn't like it, imo at least. Or if partner doesn't like the pet you'd like, making a compromise that's usually just not getting the dog.

I like cats and I like birds - but I'm fine getting neither if I had a partner who has an allergy or simply doesn't like those animals, is fine.
Can still interact with cats I find randomly, and watch birds, is cool. 

Just my two cents, really, and also I'm just kinda glad I can be stubborn enough to actually not end up in a dog nut relationship out of mere hopes of ""I may dislike dogs for the very core of what they are, but maybe I can tolerate their dog"".

TL;DR: Almost had Tinder date as self-claimed forever alone. Had dog, fragile &amp; unstable, ""no hobbies"" (self-claimed) and gtfo to avoid dog nuttery for sure.

Also wondering, any of you had similar experiences lately?

It seems like, in my experience, dog nutters, and especially the nuttiest nutters, seem to have a very strong preference for large dogs.  Pibble parents come in for a lot of flack on this sub, but I also see it a lot with German shepherds, as well as various other breeds and mixes of large dogs.  (Some of my worst dog experiences were with a husky and a golden retriever.)

When I think about dog nutters, I've had more bad experience with dogs than I can count, and yet I can only think of three cases where I had bad experiences with smallish where the owner didn't promptly take control of the situation and actively prevent it from recurring.  And one of those owners wasn't so much a dog nutter as a really crunchy hippie type who took in stray animals literally off the street and didn't believe in housebreaking or neutering.  And another one is a fake service dog I'm counting because, while she quickly reigned the dog in and apologized, she kept bringing in her poorly-trained wiener dog in a fake vest.  Only one of those three encounters was really a canonical dog nutter experience, where the owner made excuses and refused to do anything beyond call the dog's name.

Don't get me wrong, I don't *like* small dogs, but I can tolerate them *a lot* better than the large dogs.  I'm not scared of them, I don't usually find they yap any more than larger dogs bark and growl, I can shrug them off when they try to jump on me or sniff my crotch, and if I'm wear long pants, they have a hard time even licking me.  I'd even consider dating someone who owned a small dog, on the understanding that ""I don't care how sick you are, I'm not walking that thing.""

But a lot of dog nutters seem to hate small dogs with a passion.  They generally call them ""rats,"" or ""rodents,"" as if they were insulting the dogs rather than the rodents.  They talk about what ""real dogs"" are, which inevitably means being big.  Any dog that can fit in a purse is not a ""real dog.""  ~~Dog nutters~~ ""Real dog people"" often seem to be way more hostile to small dogs than I am to large dogs, and I'm terrified of and grossed out by large dogs.

He was fine.  A good dog, you might say.  Never barked, tore up anything, etc blah blah. I liked him okay and that was the extent of it.  He was never our “fur baby”, just an amusing play thing, and once we had our daughter he leaned his place and we would have tossed him out if he hurt her, which he didn’t.   We made sure he was fed and not neglected.

Well this month has been absolutely shit.  Health problems all around, hospital stays, surgeries, car problems, you name it.  It’s shit but we got through it, because my husband and kid are incredible.  Everyone is emotional and the husband is handling it all like a badass because I’m laid up in the hospital for days. 

Then the fucking dog has to be put down.  

I’ll admit.  I was sad.  I was worried about my daughter but I underestimated her maturity and she understood it was right.  My husband is the one who handled it and got a bit teary as expected.  

Here’s the thing though guys, and I’ll only admit it here.  I was happy when I got home to not have to let him in and out while recovering, or feed him.  He was old and annoying to be honest, made a lot of body noises etc, messing with my sleep.  We couldn’t stay out all day/night.  We had to make arrangements when traveling.  It’s been a nice couple of weeks, there I said it.

I cried for maybe 5 minutes, mainly out of stress and worry for my family’s feelings.  I thought of the funny shit he used to do and smiled.  I made my peace with the situation.

It’s nice to know there’s other people out there who aren’t into dog worship. I don’t know what happened. I remember when dogs used to be pets, then they became family  but now they are beyond family in a sense, almost like gods that demand praise while their owners bow down. It’s really gross. 

I don’t have anything against dogs. In fact I used to have one when I was younger. He passed away and I had two cats that passed as well. All good pets but I never thought of them as anything else. I took care of them and we had good times, that’s it. I know some owners like to consider their pets as family but that’s just not true. Sure they are part of it but pets will always be just pets regardless of how much you gloat on Facebook about your fur baby. 

After my cats passed I didn’t want pets anymore. I liked having them but I’ve always been a clean person and they are a responsibility and liked the peace and cleanliness around the house after they were gone. It was refreshing and at this point in my life I can’t imagine going backwards ever.  Never getting pets again and never want to be with someone who has em. You can’t be a dating prospect of mine and have a dog, that’s a automatic no no regardless of how nice you are. We can be friends but that’s it, ain’t going to your house either, we can meet at a coffee shop or something, preferably without the mutt either. Dog owners have just become this annoying persistent expanding sphere of entitlement. They bring em everywhere, put em in carts at the store, hair, noise, crap on your lawn, bite people etc. I wouldn’t even be writing this if they just lived in their own neighborhood. A neighborhood for pet free people and one for the 4 legged poop machine factories. I’m unlucky though and live in a neighborhood where people don’t care about being decent. 


I know not all dog owners are irresponsible. Just saying on my side, I got stuck with annoying neighbors who can definitely do better. One thing I have to look out for when tend to the lawn is shit and I hate the fact I have to do that. I wish I could walk in a yard in peace and not worry. Even if they clean it up with a bag it irks the hell out of me. I treat my yard like an extension of my self. Like for example, if you were to vomit on my shirt but then wipe the vomit off with a specialized absorbent rag that would take most of it off, yeah that’s nice but still gross and inconvenient as hell. Wouldn’t won’t you puking on me period just like I don’t want someone’s dog taking one paw on my yard and having a chance to piss or crap. I take the time to care for my yard and like to keep it that way. I understand not everyone is like this but I wish owners were more considerate of people like me. I wish the owners would just let their dogs piss and shit in their own yards since they don’t mind living in the same household with them and sleeping in the same bed with dog paws that have some nice dirt from outside along with god knows what else and nice slobbery kiss goodnight. That shit is gross. 

Can’t even be fully honest with these people. One time I told someone online that I wasn’t a fan of dogs. That was it, I literally said just wasn’t a fan of em. And she said wow... you’re giving me bad vibes. I can’t take someone who thinks not liking dogs is indicative of being bad  person seriously. You can get away with saying you don’t want kids or even hate em but say you don’t want dogs and ooooo the fingers start judging. Cause dogs are beyond human worth and we should model ourselves after hairy parasites that can’t help but always be at our side because without us they couldn’t survive. 

At least children will one day, providing you feed them enough vegetables, become productive members of society or at least try to. Dogs are forever stuck in the baby stage. If pet owners were honest about their pets being pets then it wouldn’t be so bad but they insist they are family and using words like unconditional love, loyalty. Dogs are literally parasites, not a bad thing but it is that way. Domestic ones anyways, which I do feel bad for. I for one think it’s immoral to have animals as pets. Which might seem hypocritical after I said I used to have them. It’s not a viewpoint I had forever but developed and learned over time after my period without pets. They should be running in the wild and playing the game of life not becoming fat fucks and medicated with depression anxiety and getting dressed in a elf suit for the Christmas card photo the owners are gonna share on Instagram. What’s a good ethical reason on why people should keep them in their household anyways, rhetorical question. 

A lot of breeds can’t even survive anymore in the wild. But that doesn’t mean they are fully dependent on us. The Day domesticated dogs cannot fully function without a human being is going to be a sad ass day.  People use them as a form of emotional masturbation. You know what emotional masturbation is ? That’s someone who loves to get off on the feels, while using something cheap as a the catalyst, in this case the dog. For example “my significant other dumped me but my doggo will always be there for me”  

The one thing I noticed about a lot of pet owners is they are emotionally frail. Not all but most. Bad at relationships too which is why dogs are great. No matter how much of a fuckup you are, dog will think you’re number one. Even though that dog will show the same amount of affection to someone else as long as you give him something to eat. You don’t owe it to yourself to be better at something or consider you’re a person that might have faults, what matters is the dog period. Which keeps the bad habits going. Human relationships ain’t easy but it ain’t hard either. It just takes time an doing and that sort of experience can’t be compared to animal that licks its own asshole. 

As a human my obligations and responsibilities are towards other people. I wish pet owners could give the same attention to humans like they do their pets. They might see something worth looking at. Yknow I also firmly believe if pets could talk English, pet ownership would go down almost completely. Because dogs can feel things too, they can be happy but can also be not content and irritable. And the illusion of dogs being loyal and the embodiment of love would break right there. Owners coming home from work will then feel worried and slight anxiety on having to deal with a dog who’s going to be vocal about their needs and express possible unhappiness. That’s when the relationship would become too human for them and not enough escapism.  Dogs can already express negative emotions without words it’s just most owners don’t even know these sort of things. They do that mommy speak sort of thing and represent their dogs point of view which is bad parenting btw if it was actual parenting. Yknow the whole shtick when they do their dogs voice like if they are the ones speaking “I’m sorry I broke the plate mommy” yeah that weird thing. Emotional masturbation at its finest. On the opposite side of the spectrum human relationships are just handicapped when compared to dogs because human relationships actually take work. Keyword work.  

At the end of the day I don’t care if people have pets. I just don’t like living by em because they are a annoying inconsiderate liability in our neighborhoods and public spaces. I don’t need pets and they don’t need me. I love the company of people and nothing can beat that. It feels good to get it off my chest for the first time in a place where people can understand. And if someone who is a dog lover or owner reading this. Don’t take it in a bad way. It’s just me being honest and i wouldn’t treat you with less respect as a person without a pet.

Turns out, it's two pits that look the same. But they rarely bark and don't really bother us thankfully. I walked over today to introduce myself since we moved in recently and this is the first time I've seen the owner outside. My fiance loves dogs so I figured here pet a dog whatever let's meet our neighbor.

The second I reached her porch to introduce myself, I noticed dog shit. Everywhere. I stepped on stones across the yard, and I'm glad I did, because there were shit bombs covering the whole front yard. Months of shit. The porch had shit all over it.

And then it hit me. The smell.

Dear god that introduction went quick as fuck. After we got back to my house even my fiance was like ""Jesus that was bad"" AND HE'S A DOG NUTTER","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I know I posted a bit back about buying a house with a pit owner across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it&amp;#39;s two pits that look the same. But they rarely bark and don&amp;#39;t really bother us thankfully. I walked over today to introduce myself since we moved in recently and this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve seen the owner outside. My fiance loves dogs so I figured here pet a dog whatever let&amp;#39;s meet our neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second I reached her porch to introduce myself, I noticed dog shit. Everywhere. I stepped on stones across the yard, and I&amp;#39;m glad I did, because there were shit bombs covering the whole front yard. Months of shit. The porch had shit all over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it hit me. The smell.&lt;/p&gt;

When [a dogfree member posted](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bu5cub/i_love_dogs_but/) to complain about the epidemic of ""I love dogs, but"" posts increasingly cluttering the sub, one dog-lover offered the opinion that these posts were not actually a problem, and said something that perfectly encapsulated the attitude behind dog-lovers' posts here:

&gt;""this is just a forum where you can vent about dog related issues, and other's with dogs may have those same issues as well.""

\^ This attitude, right here, is *exactly* what I'm sick of. NO, this is not ""just a forum where you can vent about dog related issues"". What part of ""DOGFREE"" do you people not understand?

r/Dogfree, as the name implies, is a sub for *the dogfree.* The only other people this would include are those who long to be dogfree but are trapped living with dogs they resent.

Yes, dog-lovers are [permitted to post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bnuc4n/welcome_to_our_community_please_read_our_faqs/) (""Anyone is welcome to post here, even those who love dogs, so long as you are posting here in good faith without trying to convert anyone""), but it apparently needs to be spelled out to you that this does not in fact mean that dog-lovers are part of r/Dogfree's actual intended userbase.

I understand that this is the only space that actually calls out dog culture and that some dog owners are also sick of dog culture. But when the topic can't come up without some dog-lover (or more) piping up about your dogs and how you love dogs and how you train them and what your dogs are like, is that respectful? Is that posting in good faith? Is that what the sub r/Dogfree is for? What about when the sub's front page is filled with posts from dog-lovers, bumping down numerous posts from the dogfree? And what about when dog-lovers [take over entire posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bo8os2/weekend_with_a_nutter/) on this sub so the comments are filled with almost nothing but inane chatter about your dogs? To add insult to injury, that last post I referenced almost appeared to have been created for that purpose (or at least that became the backup plan when not enough dogfree people gave asspats).

If you want to talk about dog culture from the perspective as a dog owner that badly and that often, instead of taking over this space, perhaps you should make one specifically catering to your needs and post less often in this one out of respect for the sub's actual purpose. Dog-lovers have been using this sub as your space for a long time, so why hasn't that happened?

LOL, just kidding, as if we don't know: We wouldn't be there to validate you. No more, ""No, you're a *good* owner! You're *nothing* like those *dog nutters*, am I right? Damn dog nutters, a group that definitely excludes you! You post here, so you are surely not one of them!"" You love to tell yourselves you're so different from the ""dog nutters"", when what you're all doing to this sub is no different to any other example of dog-lovers invading with your dogs to take over every single place, no matter how inappropriate, and convert it into a place for dogs and the people who love them. You want to talk about dog culture? THIS IS DOG CULTURE. This sub is the one solitary place that outright refuses to provide dog people the narcissistic supply to which they feel entitled. Just the one. So what do you do? The same thing dog-lovers do to every space that doesn't centre you: invade.

When &lt;a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bu5cub/i_love_dogs_but/""&gt;a dogfree member posted&lt;/a&gt; to complain about the epidemic of &amp;quot;I love dogs, but&amp;quot; posts increasingly cluttering the sub, one dog-lover offered the opinion that these posts were not actually a problem, and said something that perfectly encapsulated the attitude behind dog-lovers&amp;#39; posts here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;this is just a forum where you can vent about dog related issues, and other&amp;#39;s with dogs may have those same issues as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^ This attitude, right here, is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what I&amp;#39;m sick of. NO, this is not &amp;quot;just a forum where you can vent about dog related issues&amp;quot;. What part of &amp;quot;DOGFREE&amp;quot; do you people not understand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/Dogfree""&gt;r/Dogfree&lt;/a&gt;, as the name implies, is a sub for &lt;em&gt;the dogfree.&lt;/em&gt; The only other people this would include are those who long to be dogfree but are trapped living with dogs they resent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, dog-lovers are &lt;a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bnuc4n/welcome_to_our_community_please_read_our_faqs/""&gt;permitted to post&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;Anyone is welcome to post here, even those who love dogs, so long as you are posting here in good faith without trying to convert anyone&amp;quot;), but it apparently needs to be spelled out to you that this does not in fact mean that dog-lovers are part of &lt;a href=""/r/Dogfree""&gt;r/Dogfree&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s actual intended userbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is the only space that actually calls out dog culture and that some dog owners are also sick of dog culture. But when the topic can&amp;#39;t come up without some dog-lover (or more) piping up about your dogs and how you love dogs and how you train them and what your dogs are like, is that respectful? Is that posting in good faith? Is that what the sub &lt;a href=""/r/Dogfree""&gt;r/Dogfree&lt;/a&gt; is for? What about when the sub&amp;#39;s front page is filled with posts from dog-lovers, bumping down numerous posts from the dogfree? And what about when dog-lovers &lt;a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/bo8os2/weekend_with_a_nutter/""&gt;take over entire posts&lt;/a&gt; on this sub so the comments are filled with almost nothing but inane chatter about your dogs? To add insult to injury, that last post I referenced almost appeared to have been created for that purpose (or at least that became the backup plan when not enough dogfree people gave asspats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk about dog culture from the perspective as a dog owner that badly and that often, instead of taking over this space, perhaps you should make one specifically catering to your needs and post less often in this one out of respect for the sub&amp;#39;s actual purpose. Dog-lovers have been using this sub as your space for a long time, so why hasn&amp;#39;t that happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOL, just kidding, as if we don&amp;#39;t know: We wouldn&amp;#39;t be there to validate you. No more, &amp;quot;No, you&amp;#39;re a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; owner! You&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; like those &lt;em&gt;dog nutters&lt;/em&gt;, am I right? Damn dog nutters, a group that definitely excludes you! You post here, so you are surely not one of them!&amp;quot; You love to tell yourselves you&amp;#39;re so different from the &amp;quot;dog nutters&amp;quot;, when what you&amp;#39;re all doing to this sub is no different to any other example of dog-lovers invading with your dogs to take over every single place, no matter how inappropriate, and convert it into a place for dogs and the people who love them. You want to talk about dog culture? THIS IS DOG CULTURE. This sub is the one solitary place that outright refuses to provide dog people the narcissistic supply to which they feel entitled. Just the one. So what do you do? The same thing dog-lovers do to every space that doesn&amp;#39;t centre you: invade.&lt;/p&gt;

Growing up, I had four cats. Once all but one passed on, my parents moved to dogs. They first got a yorkie poo, who was actually rather  well behaved. At that time I was slowly coming to realize that even if it’s my own dog, I’m still not a fan. That dog passed on and now they have a shih tzu. That dog is the worst.

Irregardless about How you feel, about fast food workers, we gotta admit that McDonald's is one of The Largest employer, world wide. I work there. As a cashier. A trainee, and a single person who moved to a shitty part of the usa south. 


So it is Memorial day weekend. It was busy, to say the least. 

Then, during a half hour of quiet: a dog owner comes in, and seeing me at the desk, he comes to me. Typical.

And then he asks me: Can I bring my dog in here? It is a:
-puppy
-german shepherd
-it is dog on hot outside
-I'm training it


And I said: 
No, because: X Y Z 


That felt so good, because saying No is awesome. 

(Reasons, because there are several reasonS:
-It is a food establishment: no one wants physical contamination from dog dander and fur. 
-There are children present: and dogs are unpredictable fur demons. 
-It is a dog and will probably shit and piss *somewhere*. It would be TERRIBLE to have caused a disgusting mess that *must be* cleaned by hand, because the fancy floor machine cannot clean shit and piss.
I also love my coworkers and I could not do that to the present maintenence staff. I love them, also. 
-I dont give a shit about service dogs, because I know most people buy a fake vest online, for their dumb ass non-service-dog Dog. I dont care that it is an Emotional-Support-Animal: get it the fuck out of here.

Let me explain.

So when I was about 10, I didn't really have any friends and basically all I would do is just lock myself in my room and play video games. Anyway, one day, my mum comes into my room and asks me what I want for my birthday (it was about 2 weeks away), and I ask her if I could get a bearded dragon, with terrarium etc. She says she'll think about it and a few days later she tells me that they were too expensive, terrarium was pricy, needed heat lamps etc... She asks me again if there was something else I wanted and I say ""I guess a cat?"". She says that she'll try, ""but it will have to be from a shelter"". Fast forward to my birthday, I come out to the living room, and my mum says happy birthday etc. gives me this really fat tabby cat She asks me what I want to name him, and at the time we had the Garfield movie on DVD, and I absolutely digged that shit, So I named him Nermal of course. Anyway, this cat was a sweetheart and I loved him so fecking much, he'd always cuddle and sit in front of my keyboard when I played on my PC, this cat was pretty much my life.

So, fast forward about 6 months, my mum lets him out, which I had told her many times not to. A few hours pass and I go looking for him (on the times he was out he'd usually just sit on the patio), I go around the block and after a small gander I find him dead in the bushes, lifeless and covered in blood. I instantly tear up and start breaking down, I ran back home, covered in tears and she tells me to get a bag to put him in. I get a bag, go back there and I find a dog chewing on him. I scream at the top of my lungs and the dog runs off. I put him in the bag and walk home, crying my eyes out all the way. I get home and she tells me to put him in the bin, I say no and she grabs the bag and chucks him in. I was devastated and I cried myself to sleep for many nights after that. I hated my mother for what she made me do, and I don't talk to her to this day.

TLDR: Cat had gotten lost and then attacked/killed by a dog. Mum made me put him in a bag and walk home.

Sorry for bad punctuation/format etc, typing this on phone.

Edit: Totally unexpected but someone gave me gold, I don't want to be a cliche reddittard, but thanks so much, I just hope more people see just how shit dogs and parents can really be.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hate for dogs doesn&amp;#39;t come out of nowhere, I have a reason.

I’m currently staying at their house for the summer (boyfriend is 25 and I’m 22 and at university). The dog is the neediest creature I’ve ever seen in my life. My boyfriend’s mum goes out to work early in the morning and comes home late. My boyfriend’s dad sometimes works from 1-11pm, and when he does, he leaves at about 12:30pm. The dog is fine until that point, but as soon as dad leaves, dog will run around the house whining for about 5 minutes. When he realises nobody is there, he just howls.

I made an account on reddit just to ask for advice on a dilemma I'm having. This is gonna be a long one, so sorry.

I've lived here with my parents since I was 14 and now I'm 30. I've had the luxury of growing up with parents that don't want dogs, so I've been dog free all of my life. It's been mostly quiet here except for the occasional dog bark until now. About a year and a half ago, my quiet neighbors right next door moved out and sold the house to someone that owns 2 or maybe 3 shitbeasts. I know there's at least 2 but it sounds like 3.

Let me tell you about these fucking shitbeasts. They bark continuously for 5-6 minutes straight every 15-20 minutes all fucking day and night long. One of them is a breed that has an absolutely horrible howling sound that sounds like someone crying in pain. **It is driving me absolutely fucking insane.** I have crippling depression and social anxiety already and it's making my life even more miserable.

So, obviously the solution you would think is to call animal control and/or the police on them. Not so fast, my parents do not want me to do anything and/or rock the boat with the neighbors. My dad does not want to deal with the police nor does he want to piss off the neighbors. He's paranoid because he smokes weed and grows it. He's had a medical license and it's now legal here in Michigan. But that doesn't matter, weed makes you paranoid and in his mind he thinks it still gets the attention of the police and will have them looking for things to bust you with. Plus, he's the type that doesn't like to snitch on anyone. My parents should support me in my mental illness but they're not.

But wait, that's not the only thing. This neighbor is somehow involved with one of the city's building inspectors that's very respected from what I've heard. I don't know if he's family or if the bitch neighbor is dating him but I see him over there all the time, sometimes with city owned vehicles. So my dad especially does not want to piss off this neighbor and have the city inspector possibly retaliating against him. Isn't that bullshit though? That the city inspector is letting this bitch have her dogs annoy the neighborhood. I suspect that this is the reason it's not being dealt with. Either the city is showing favoritism towards this neighbor or no one is making complaints because they're afraid too. We have anti-barking and noise ordinances here in the city that doesn't require more than one neighbor to make a complaint.

I suspect it's favoritism because I have went against my parents and made anonymous reports on the city's website and by phone, but the shitbeasts are still barking. The next steps would require me to shed my anonymity. I am ready to go to war with this neighbor and the city, even through the courts if I had to but I can't as I've just explained why. I have a lot of camera video showing these fuckers barking. I have extensive medical documentation from my psychiatrist and therapist showing that this is exacerbating my mental illness and causing me to lose sleep. I would definitely win through the courts. I would so love to bankrupt this bitch, even take her house with a judgment; getting that building inspector fired would be a bonus. My only other option is to move but I can't. I don't have any money. I am currently fighting for Social Security disability. I just went to an appeal hearing a few weeks ago and am waiting for a decision.

My ex has 3 dogs total. 1 large male, 1 large female, 1 small male.

One day, his ex was taking a nap after work in her bed. She thought the dogs were all out in the living room with dude. They weren’t. The large male dog jumped up in the bed (they often slept with this dog) and fell asleep. 

My ex comes in the bedroom to wake his girlfriend up and the dog gets “scared” as he is awoken. Next thing you know, he’s diving down for the girlfriend and bites her nose to the point it’s almost hanging off! My ex took her to the ER but lied and said it happened while they were rough playing and not sleeping peacefully. Never once thought of getting rid of the dog or putting it down even though it bit one of its owners for no apparent reason.

The dog continued to live with them even though the girlfriend had to get fucking plastic surgery on her face.

Tiny but has 2 pit rotweiler mixes.  Too large to walk both at the same time so she has to take them on separate walks, but still struggles.

Sleeps in a twin sized bed sandwiched between both.   Doesn't own any sheets or blankets because they tear them up too easy.  Uses a cheap sleeping bag to cover themselves and changes it every couple months when it's too torn up.

Dogs wouldn't sleep with us when I was over, but smelled naaaaaaaaasty.

Barked all all all all night

A chihuahua, so small, but bit all her friends too.  Bit with out provocation, out of no where.  Tore the glasses off my face once trying to bite me.  Woke me up with bites.

Isn't it kinda hella weird to be sandwiched by two animals spooning you like a bf ?

Why would you voluntarily choose to live without sheets/blankets?

Why would you sleep in a bed with anything that woke you up every hour ?  

Why would you keeps something that bit all your friends ? 

And no, the dog will sleep on my side of the bed isn't a compromise.

Like, LOVES dogs. She wants to run a dog boarding business when she retires. We had a few dogs when I was a kid, and I remember really loving Wrinkles (a sharpei mix) and Scooby (a dachshund). We used to take the puppies from the strays around my uncle's house and keep them in our backyard until we found them new homes, and I remember loving the puppies.

But then I hit middle school, and my mom discovered an outlet for her passion: fostering dogs. It started small, just one or two at a time. But by my freshman year of high school, we were fostering 10+ at a time, not counting our own three dogs, and we pet-sat our neighbors' three dogs fairly often. There were times when we had 18 dogs in the house, for weeks at a time.

All of these dogs were on rotation, no one of them staying at our place more than a few months (and usually just a few weeks). ALL of them were untrained, many were not housebroken, and ALL of them barked. Incessantly. My stepdad's lab learned to go to the front window, bark at nothing until all the other dogs were freaking out, then sneak into the kitchen and eat food off the counter while we were trying to calm the howling horde. That was the BEST-behaved dog we owned or fostered.

We fostered one little mutt named Dolly who was deaf. She couldn't hear herself bark - so naturally, she barked NON-STOP. I mean *non-stop.* If she was awake, she was barking. She would stop in the middle of eating to bark.

One of our own dogs, Zeus, had the most shrill bark you've ever heard. Now here it's relevant to know that my mom is partially deaf, particularly to high and low-pitched noises. One day she said, ""You know what I like about Zeus? He doesn't bark!"" Man, I wanted to strangle her.

Then there were the fluffernutters - the three little white mutts that we pet-sat with aggravating regularity. Those fuckers HOWLED. A little during the day, but mostly at night, all night long. And if I can rant a bit about ""dog culture"" here - all three of them were sick, and their owners spent TENS of THOUSANDS of dollars keeping the poor things barely alive because they wanted each of their kids to have their own pet. Fuck a college fund, amirite?

There were constant dog fights at our house. How could there not be, with that many dogs? It was great for an anxiety-ridden, stressed-out high schooler. And the fuckers ran away ALL the time. We had to keep a baby gate a few feet away from the front door, which was a pain in itself. But you'd be amazed how ineffective the thing was - we might as well not have had it, the damn things got out so often. I'm a notorious insomniac who HATES being woken up because I get so little sleep to begin with. I cannot begin to tell you how many times my mother woke me up in the middle of the night to chase down a damn dog. Or asked me to walk the dogs in the middle of the night because ""you're not sleeping anyway."" I HATED walking the dogs. I absolutely cannot stand when they pull, and we had to walk so many at a time that they would regularly pull you to the ground and skin your knees.

Oh yeah, and who had to walk ALL the dogs every morning, afternoon, and night? Me and my brother. Who had to pooper-scooper the backyard once a week? Me and my brother. Who had to feed and water the dogs? Me and my brother. Who had to clean up the piss and shit when they went inside the house? Me and my brother. It was my mom's idea, my mom's passion, but my brother and I did ALL the work.

Flash forward a few years. Of course, now that my brother and I are out of the house, my mom doesn't foster dogs anymore (but she still owns two). I swipe left on every Tinder profile that has a dog pic. I have to explain my whole Tragic Backstory to everyone who owns a dog because they just cannot comprehend why I wouldn't want to own a dog. When I was looking for apartments, I had the choice between the one I'm in and a cheaper one very close by. I chose this one despite a $100 difference, because the other place had a dog. I told my roommate this when I moved in. I thought I had escaped and was free. But then, a few months later... my roommate went and got a dog.

The whole two-hour ride to the shelter, I tried to talk her out of it. I begged her to get a cat instead. On the way back, defeated, I asked her if we could at least have a ""no dogs in the kitchen/on the couch"" rule and she agreed. Of course, the very next day I come home and she's cuddling with the damn thing on the couch. It quickly became apparent that this dog would receive no training and abide by no rules. She let it chew her pillows, her vintage stuffed animals, even her shoes (but would get mad if it chewed her ""good"" shoes - how the hell is it supposed to know the difference?). And of course it chewed my things, too. It pissed on my bed three times (I can't close my door because my cats need access to their litter box). That thing was constantly in the way, in the kitchen, on the couch, everywhere.

I also told my roommate when she got the dog that I eschewed all responsibility for it. I told her I would not walk it, feed it, or water it. If she was going out of town, she'd better board it. Of course, that didn't last long. She'd go straight from work to the club and call me asking me to walk and feed it. What was I supposed to do, let the thing piss in the house and go to bed hungry? If I tried to remind her that I didn't want any responsibility for this dog, she'd get mad and say that she ""couldn't help it"" that she wouldn't be home in time and it ""wasn't fair to the dog"" for me to not take care of it.

Then the last few months. The damn thing suddenly decided that it didn't want to do its business outside, so it took to shitting and pissing in *my* room. Now I keep the apartment clean, but sometimes my laundry covers my bedroom floor for a week or so before I motivate myself to pick it up. Who cares, it's my room. Except the dog decided it would shit in my room, and then *bury its shit under my clothes.* The litter box is in my room so it always smells faintly of shit and piss. So I wouldn't notice by smell until I either stepped in it (thereby grinding poop into my clothes) or picked up my room. I picked up one T-shirt that had been sitting there for no more than three days - a very sentimental T-shirt, mind you, hand-painted by my favorite local band who are also my friends, on the very night we met - and what do I find? A giant, dark piss-stain on the hardwood floors. I almost lost it. The good news is that the apartment complex isn't going to charge us for it, and the shirt took well to dry-cleaning, but I still have to look at that ugly stain in my bedroom for the next year and think, ""Ugh, that's the piss-stain. That's where the dog pissed on my fucking floor.""

Now for today: My roommate is moving out in one week, and I absolutely cannot wait to be dog-free again. It has been a long and arduous journey, and I will NEVER understand why anyone would ever want to own a dog (especially when cats are so much better), but at least it will be over soon.

That thing was constantly in the way, in the kitchen, on the couch, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also told my roommate when she got the dog that I eschewed all responsibility for it. I told her I would not walk it, feed it, or water it. If she was going out of town, she&amp;#39;d better board it. Of course, that didn&amp;#39;t last long. She&amp;#39;d go straight from work to the club and call me asking me to walk and feed it. What was I supposed to do, let the thing piss in the house and go to bed hungry? If I tried to remind her that I didn&amp;#39;t want any responsibility for this dog, she&amp;#39;d get mad and say that she &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t help it&amp;quot; that she wouldn&amp;#39;t be home in time and it &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t fair to the dog&amp;quot; for me to not take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the last few months. The damn thing suddenly decided that it didn&amp;#39;t want to do its business outside, so it took to shitting and pissing in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; room. Now I keep the apartment clean, but sometimes my laundry covers my bedroom floor for a week or so before I motivate myself to pick it up. Who cares, it&amp;#39;s my room. Except the dog decided it would shit in my room, and then &lt;em&gt;bury its shit under my clothes.&lt;/em&gt; The litter box is in my room so it always smells faintly of shit and piss. So I wouldn&amp;#39;t notice by smell until I either stepped in it (thereby grinding poop into my clothes) or picked up my room. I picked up one T-shirt that had been sitting there for no more than three days - a very sentimental T-shirt, mind you, hand-painted by my favorite local band who are also my friends, on the very night we met - and what do I find? A giant, dark piss-stain on the hardwood floors. I almost lost it. The good news is that the apartment complex isn&amp;#39;t going to charge us for it, and the shirt took well to dry-cleaning, but I still have to look at that ugly stain in my bedroom for the next year and think, &amp;quot;Ugh, that&amp;#39;s the piss-stain. That&amp;#39;s where the dog pissed on my fucking floor.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for today: My roommate is moving out in one week, and I absolutely cannot wait to be dog-free again. It has been a long and arduous journey, and I will NEVER understand why anyone would ever want to own a dog (especially when cats are so much better), but at least it will be over soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my rant!&lt;/p&gt;

I went off to college last summer so I decided to make the drive, even though I knew his dogs would probably be there. I thought it would be worth spending time with him.

So I get there and the dogs are jumping on me right away, whatever... I've been to his house before and they calm down in a couple minutes. Of course, this happens every single time anyone walks in the door - its not a huge deal, but definitely still ridiculous. We had some great food and drinks that night, it was fun overall.

But what really started to leave a bad taste in my mouth was at 6 AM the next morning. I was sleeping in a room with my friend and his sister. Their mom woke up around 6 which also means the dogs, who sleep in their room, are also up. Of course, the first thing the dogs do is burst into our room (door was cracked), one of them literally hopping on my bed and walking on me. My friend, her sister, and their mom all said ""[Dog name] no!"" in a disapproving tone, but nothing else. They had to tell it to get down multiple times before it actually moved. Eventually got the dogs out of the room, so we closed the door and went back to sleep. 

How the fuck do you have such a weak response to that? You invite someone into your home, and then the dogs burst into the room at 6 AM the first morning, one of them jumping on to your guest's bed and walking on him. And they brushed it off like it was nothing. I know dogs aren't very smart, but I've also been around calmer dogs that have actually been taught not to do shit like that, so I know it's possible to train them at least that much. If your child jumped on a guest who was in bed sleeping at 6 AM, they would be in so much fucking trouble.

We went out on the boat that day, and of course the dogs had to come. The sensation of being on the boat calmed the dogs down a bit, but this was when I really started to notice the dog worship from my friend's family. We anchored the boat down and chilled for a few hours, having food and alcohol in some waist-deep water. They went on for hours and hours the rest of the day about how their dogs were so smart, cute, protective, etc. Y'all know the drill. I just couldn't believe the sheer amount of time they spent talking about the dogs. I'm lucky that, before heading to the lakehouse, I told my friend I'd need to leave in the middle of the weekend to get some work done (which I do, but I could've afforded to stay longer). They are still at the lake, probably going on an on about the dogs as I type this.

Honestly though, if there's anything good I can take from this weekend, it's that I've been able to identify my general dislike for dogs and complete dislike of dog worship. Wasn't sure how I felt before this wekeend, but now I just don't want anything to do with that. I wanna be clear that I don't have much against my friend here, since he isn't that much of a dog worshipper. Just sucks that the rest of his family is how they are.

Now, I have no problems answering this question, so to the OP of the post that was just deleted (or anyone else who's curious), please see below for my response as to why I hate (most) dogs:

Dogs are disgusting. They stink, and they stink up anything they come into contact with. They drool, they track dirt/mud/snow/filth in from outside all over your house. They shed their nasty, greasy, stinky hair all over the place. They piss and shit in the house because they're ""excited"", ""upset"", and other bullshit reasons like that. They lick you with their nasty, bacteria laden tongue that was likely up their ass just a moment ago.

Dogs are obnoxious. Always barking at people, barking at other dogs, barking at their own damn shadow. The sound of their whining makes me want to gouge my own eardrums out. The only thing worse is that hideous high-pitched yelp they do. And don't even get me started on growling and snarling. Not to mention the constant begging for food and attention. Always following you around, bothering you. Sometimes I just want to be left the hell alone. Dogs cant seem to grasp this. Also, their mouth noises are the worst. Splashing and slurping up water and food, chewing their nasty feet and nails, gnawing their own bodies, and loudly giving themselves oral.

Dogs are aggressive. Most of them have food aggression, possessive aggression, stranger aggression, or all of the above. They're just aggressive by nature and the majority of them should be put down for this reason in the interest of public safety. 

Dogs are a burden. I have no urge to base my daily routine and vacation planning around the needs of an animal that literally contributes nothing to my life. 

To OPs follow up question, yes, I've met a very small handful of dogs that I've liked, but none I'd ever allow in my house.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was recently another post on here asking why we don&amp;#39;t like dogs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have no problems answering this question, so to the OP of the post that was just deleted (or anyone else who&amp;#39;s curious), please see below for my response as to why I hate (most) dogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs are disgusting. They stink, and they stink up anything they come into contact with. They drool, they track dirt/mud/snow/filth in from outside all over your house. They shed their nasty, greasy, stinky hair all over the place. They piss and shit in the house because they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;excited&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;upset&amp;quot;, and other bullshit reasons like that. They lick you with their nasty, bacteria laden tongue that was likely up their ass just a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs are obnoxious. Always barking at people, barking at other dogs, barking at their own damn shadow. The sound of their whining makes me want to gouge my own eardrums out. The only thing worse is that hideous high-pitched yelp they do. And don&amp;#39;t even get me started on growling and snarling. Not to mention the constant begging for food and attention. Always following you around, bothering you. Sometimes I just want to be left the hell alone. Dogs cant seem to grasp this. Also, their mouth noises are the worst. Splashing and slurping up water and food, chewing their nasty feet and nails, gnawing their own bodies, and loudly giving themselves oral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs are aggressive. Most of them have food aggression, possessive aggression, stranger aggression, or all of the above. They&amp;#39;re just aggressive by nature and the majority of them should be put down for this reason in the interest of public safety. &lt;/p&gt;

So, in the spirit of that, I figure I’ll share some memorable moments of my own with the wonderful DoGgO I used to have.

**Top 5 Memorable Moments with My Dog**

**#5 - Company Pisser**

Last December-ish, my boyfriend had some family members come visit from out of town. They, along with his parents, decided to stop by for a bit as the family from out of town hadn’t yet seen our home.

Our wonderful shitbeast spent the entire time barking and growling at the guests, jumping away from them like a tweaker anytime they attempted to be friendly with it, and generally acting like a complete
cuntwipe.

As I was standing there talking to one of the family members, I hear an unmistakable sound coming from a few feet away. I turn around to see the worthless mutt standing there taking a piss. A waterfall stream of piss. On its own bed. Looking me right in the eye.

Needless to say I locked the beast up in its crate in the outbuilding, where it stayed the duration of the visit. The cherry on top of the sundae? It took a second spite piss in its crate and then laid right down in it.

**#4 - Duck Shit Disaster**

I’ve got a small flock of ducks and chickens. I generally clean their coops each weekend, but this particular Sunday I had plans to visit my parents. I figure, no problem, I can clean the coops in the morning and then head out.

I let the shitbeast outside so it can run around and burn off some of its energy while I work on the coops. After dumping all the soiled hay back behind the barn, I stop for a minute to sit down and take a
break. Shitbeast disappears.

I walk around hollering for it (to no avail), looking around, and finally after a few minutes, I find it. Laying in the soiled hay pile behind the barn. Chowing down on duck and chicken shit.

After yelling at it and hauling it back into the house, I start getting ready to go to my family’s. I load the mutt into the car (my
mom was obsessed with this thing and always insisted I bring it to their house), and head off.

Not ten minutes into the drive, I hear a horrible sound coming from the back of my car. There’s no where I can pull over, nothing I can do, as the beast goes *“hurk, hurk, hurk, blech”*, vomiting up a mess
of half-digested chicken and duck shit all over the back of my car. The stench was something straight from hell. The stain remains to this day.

**#3 - Biohazard Zone**

Our mutt never did get properly housebroken (and believe me, it was
not for lack of trying...at least on my part). It would soil when left unsupervised, whether crated or not, which eventually led me to crate the monster in one of our outbuildings during the night and if we were away from any period of time.

Well, I go outside early one morning to release the beast, only to notice that it had shat all over its crate (not an uncommon
occurrence, and no, the dog had nothing medically wrong with it). Disgusted, I let it out so I can start making preparations to wash it and the soiled crate.

I go back inside, tell my boyfriend the dog soiled in the crate overnight, and to not let it back in the house until it’s been bathed,
and that I’m going to get its food and feed it outside.

Guess what my boyfriend does not two minutes later. Seriously. Just Guess.

OPENS THE FRONT DOOR AND LETS THE SHIT-COVERED DOG BACK IN.

The beast comes running through the main living area of the house, leaving shit-prints everywhere it goes as it proceeds to contaminate the entirety of my home with its filth.

I throw open the door, scream at the mutt to get outside, and oh so politely ask my boyfriend WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU??? DID YOU NOT SEE THAT THE DOG WAS COVERED IN SHIT YOU IDIOT???

His response: “I thought it was just pee.”

I don’t think I ever felt more homicidal in my entire life.

**#2 - Christmas Morning Surprise**

Remember when I mentioned above that the dog was crated outside at night? Well, this is the incident that led to that.

Christmas Eve, I decide to go to bed early, knowing that the next day is going to be a busy one. Baking, driving 80+ miles to go see family, everything else that comes with the holiday. I let the dog out to go
to the bathroom, it goes, I let it back in, then hit the sheets.

Then next morning, I wake up, open my bedroom door, and am immediately
assailed with an unmistakable stench. That vile, putrid odor that smells like it could just as soon be the decaying, rotten crust
between Satan’s balls.

It was the stench of dog shit. Diarrhea over the entirety of my house. On CHRISTMAS MORNING.

The best part?

After me yelling at the dog and locking it outside, boyfriend legit asked me, “why are you so upset?”

**#1 - The Best Day Ever**

If you’re still with me, you’re probably thinking that nothing can top the things I mentioned above. That no memory could possibly stand out more than those.

Well, you’re wrong. There is one that stands out above the rest.

The very best memory I have with the dog....

..is the day **I got rid of it**.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m always hearing dognutters babbling on about the fond memories they have/had with their mutts.

The dog is actually really quiet, not nosy, etc. It’s almost like a cat, but the owner (particularly her male cousin- not so much his wife) is just a garbage, self-centered, scoff-law dog owner.

The insanity started this morning when we went down to some train tracks and he brought the dog in tow and had the leash and harness in his hand but never securing the dog-not even once. He was even worried the loud horn would frighten the dog but never considered the safety of his pet or the strife of the conductor or passengers should the unexpected have happened. Instead, it appeared much more important he keep the dog off the leash in a public area for show.

Later we went to a nearby National Park and he decided to take the dog along because “He likes to be a part of his pack.” Ok, but he isn’t allowed on any of the trails, so the poor thing had to sit inside a hot car and walk a bit in the parking lot while my friend and I hiked and felt rushed to finish because her cousin had to stay with the dog at the vehicle.

Still at the park, they settled into an open parking space just chatting and eating snacks. I never stood in the spot, instead being considerate and standing on the sidewalk. A car drove by slowly to park (as it was getting crowded) and as he sped off because the fucking family and dog were just loitering there, the female cousin laughed to us, “Ha! Find another spot! The dog is parked here!” 

When they were just ignoring the dog a bit and left his leash lying on the ground while it sat in the parking space, I took his leash and walked him a little. When I walked close to people, I kept him on a short lead because I didn’t want him to interact with anyone. I don’t just assume a curious dog and his teeth are something everyone wants to interact with. The cousin saw me keeping him close and joked that I was “choking” his dog and then made cracks to the dog as such: “Don’t worry! We’ll trip her later. She can’t choke you like that and get away with it!” Yeah, hahahaha, buddy. Pardon me for surprising you with responsible behavior.

We went into town for lunch after the park and, already working with limited options because the town is so small, had even more limited options because we had to consider if the place let smelly dogs loiter about the dining area.

The rest of the day was stopping at open spaces while the dog just ran amok off-leash. We were in a National Forest when the dog (again, totally free) started approaching another dog that was clearly in distress and acting VERY defensively. He was cowered and pointing at their dog and looked like if he hadn’t been on a leash (which we couldn’t see until later) he would have killed all of us. The cousin was stupid enough to ask if their dog was friendly. Like- no dude. I have literally never seen a less friendly looking dog.

I have another day and night with this idiot. Ugh.

Edit: Forgot to mention that while at the restaurant the owner said dogs are ok on the patio on a leash. They couldn’t even manage that, getting annoyed with me when I tried to hold onto the leash because they just had it attached to the dog and let him wander around freely. 

I’m not a dog owner, but I’m certain that’s not how a leash is meant to work.

Edit 2: I am now sitting in the car while they let the dog run around on a field that specifies very clearly that dogs aren’t allowed. They joked it was ok because a few feet down on the fence it doesn’t specify as such. What the fuck? This guy is an environmental worker just like I am and he and his family have fucking no regard for the environment the minute it impacts them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I am on a road trip with a friend and for three days we are staying with her cousins who happen to have a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand, you love those shitbeasts for whatever reason and are sad they're probably going to be put down. Today she called me and informed me that she went and picked them up from the shelter because she ""loves them more than anything"", and is bringing them here.
I have told her numerous times in the past that not only am I ""not a fan"" of dogs (my nice way of saying I despise them), but I am also highly allergic. I should also state that for the last two months, I have been having severe allergic breathing problems, and it is completely consuming my soul. I have racked up over 4,000 dollars in doctors bills and still have made 0 progress. Now I have to deal with this bullshit. I can't fucking breathe at ALL as I'm writing this. I have told her about my breathing problems and how incredible miserable I am due to such. I guess these shitbeasts matter more than my ability to breathe, so in less than a month, I already have to find a new place to live because of FUCKING DOGS.

I will never understand why people ""love"" these fucking things so much.
Rant over. I love this community and it's so relieving sometimes to know that there are other people who feel as I do about dogs, because whenever i say ""I'm not a dog person"" to 99.9% of people, they look at me as if i have actually just killed God himself and pissed on his corpse.

I stayed at a buddy's place (and loved on his cats and chinchillas the whole time) after telling her she had a week to make a decision, a roommate or the dogs. After I returned, she tried to guilt trip me as being the reason for getting rid of the dogs. Doesn't work on me at all. I'm still a little salty, and now I have to spend the entirety of the day wearing a full face respirator and vacuuming and de-dogging the entire house. Side note, shortly after I got back she made the statement ""sorry but I care about those dogs more than I do about you"" so that's pretty cool to know that I'm less valued than disgusting, ugly, disposable, stupid animals.

**Background**

The study looks at the policies of 20 large institutions part of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and compares their policies for animals in a hospital setting. It generally identifies four common types of hospital animal access: 

*Animal-assisted activities* 

&gt;Personal pets of volunteers that have been trained (""therapy animals"") and meet certain standards, in general ""required to be &gt;1–2 years of age, be fed a fully cooked diet for the preceding 90 days, not be in estrus \[heat\], have lived with their owner in a residence for &gt;6 months, and be housebroken, well mannered, obedient, easily controlled by voice command, and restrained by a short (4–6 feet) leash or lead"" and ""Almost all policies required that the animals undergo regular (usually annual) evaluation by a veterinarian confirming their good health, that they be up-to-date on vaccinations, and that they have normal laboratory work (2 policies required routine negative stool cultures prior to participation).""   
&gt;  
&gt;12 (of 20) policies required ""a nationally or regionally recognized organization to approve the animal for registration and certification of its training as an animal-assisted activities animal. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;20 of 23 institutions had policies that excluded certain patients based on medical risk, but participation is not mandatory.

*Service animals*

&gt;18 of 23 submitted policies on service animals ""Most policies mentioned that service animals are not pets, and a few institutions specified that comfort and companionship animals are not service animals. Although most policies specifically allowed dogs, some also allowed the use of cats and miniature horses. A few institutions considered emotional support and seizure alert animals to be service animals.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""a physician order and permission from the Infection Prevention and Control Department were often required.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Areas that policies often listed as off-limits included operating rooms, post-anesthesia areas, heart and vascular procedure rooms, intensive care units, family birthing areas, pharmacy, central sterile processing, food preparation areas, nurseries, medication rooms, diagnostic areas, dialysis units, playrooms, **rooms where the patient has a roommate, rooms that house patients with documented animal allergies or phobias, and around patients with altered mental status** or post-splenectomy patients.""  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, the rules for visitors were the same as patients though some excluded them in higher risk wards such as ICU, oncology, or isolation.

*Animals in research*

&gt;1/3 had policies for animal research (like lab mice for medical study or animals used specifically for scientific research). ""...when research animals must be present in patient care areas, animal visits must be scheduled to minimize overlap with patient care activities. Policies also detailed how animals should be transported safely in the facility. For example, small animals should be caged and covered with drapes or opaque material.""

*Personal pet visitation*

13 of 23 institutions had policies that allowed pets in some circumstances, but the requirements varied.

From Table 5 (Summary of Policy Requirements for Personal Pet Visitation)--

|Situation||Allowed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Did not allow personal pets||4/23|
|No response or did not submit policy and procedure||6/23|
|Allowed personal pets||13/23|
|Allowed only dogs and cats||6/13|
|Allowed dogs only||2/13|
|Specified age (&gt;1–2 y/o) and duration of ownership (&gt;6–12 mo)||5/13|
|Did not specify type of pets||5/13|
|Excluded many types of animals||3/13|
|Visitation prohibited for patients in isolation, ICU, or immunocompromised||6/13|
|Case-by-case determination||8/13|
|Allowed pets for extenuating circumstances||6/13|
|Specified duration of visitation (1–2 hr)||5/13|
|Required certification of pet’s immunization status and good health||5/13|

""While most institutions outlined prerequisites necessary to allow personal pet visitation, some only required permission from the nursing manager and attending physician.""

**Frequency of Allowed Access**

""A total of 337 SHEA members and members of the SHEA Research Network (21.7% response of 1,550 members) responded to the survey regarding their institutions’ policies for AHC (Table 6).""

* 95% allowed service animals in some capacity. (83% Internationally)
* 89% allowed animal assisted activities of some sort. (67% Internationally)
* 40% allowed personal pet visits of any kind. (20% Internationally)

Of those that allowed animals, their access was limited by location for patients and employees. Though conditionally permitted by policy, they had not necessarily been used/permitted there in practice.

|Area in Healthcare Facility||Explicitly Disallowed in Location (N=335)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Intensive care unit||230 (73%)|
|Operating room||293 (93%) |
|Kitchen||211 (67%)|
|Pharmacy||280 (89%)|
|Step-down units||123 (39%)|
|Recovery room||271 (86%)|
|Central processing||290 (92%)|

**Of particular note to DF:**

""Appropriately designed studies are needed to better define the risks and benefits of allowing animals in the healthcare setting for specific purposes"" and ""... insufficient studies are available to produce generalizable, evidence-based recommendations (Table 2); therefore, wide variations exist in policies and practice across healthcare institutions.""

""... because animals have, in general, been excluded from hospitals, experience gained by means of case reports and outbreak investigations is minimal (Table 2). However, general knowledge of zoonotic diseases, case reports, and limited research involving animals in healthcare facilities indicate cause for concern.""

""In a review of “pet-facilitated therapy” as an aid to psychotherapy, Draper et al14 noted that although a literature review conducted in 1987 revealed more than 1,000 articles on the human-animal bond, only 6 controlled studies evaluating the therapeutic value of animal- assisted activities had been reported as of 1983. These studies concluded that the benefits of animal-assisted activities relied heavily on anecdotal reports and the widespread attachment of persons with animals. In a critical appraisal of the literature from 1986 through 1997, Allen15 concluded that most reports describing the effects of human-canine interactions fell into the lowest category of scientific studies (ie, descriptive studies and expert opinion)."" *Newer studies are using controlled experiments, but their findings take time to inform policy. Policymakers and advocates may make decisions from older, less rigorous research.*

""Further, while visitation with pets can be restricted, in theory, to only the individual patient, in practice, this may not be the case, as pets could encounter various HCP, visitors, and patients during their time in the facility. Therefore, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the implications of visitation of a personal pet are guaranteed to be restricted to an individual patient."" *Said otherwise, pets should only come in contact with the patient, but it is irresponsible to think that this is how it will actually happen.*

""**Pets should, in general, be prohibited from entering the healthcare facility, including pets of HCP, patients, and visitors.** Exceptions can be considered when the healthcare team determines that visitation with a pet would be of benefit to the patient and can be performed with limited risk to the patient, other patients, and healthcare facility as a whole.""

Among several recommendations for policy, exceptions, inappropriate conditions, the paper specifically discusses transport of animals and the location of visits.

* Visitation is best performed outside of the medical facility whenever possible, consistent with facility rules for leaving the facility under proper supervision.
* If outdoor visitation is not possible, visitation should beperformed in a private room.
* If visitation must occur in a multi-bed room, **explicit permission from the roommate (or roommate’s guardian) and the roommate’s physician must be obtained prior to arrival arriving.** Animals should be taken directly to the site of visitation, avoiding areas of heavy traffic.
* The person transporting the animal should prevent the animal from coming into contact with other patients or HCP. \[medical staff, nurses, etc.\]
*  The pet should be transported in a carrier whenever possible, or on a leash that is &lt;2 m (6 ft) in length. 
* Animals must not be allowed to roam freely in the visitation area.

**Discussion**

In general, if you or someone you know is planning to be hospitalized or you know what facility you are likely to be taken to, check ahead about what policies are in place. If you are afraid of animals, have allergies, or have a general objection to animals let facilities staff know to make sure that is in your chart. Make sure your nurse knows so that signage is posted on your door to not bring in ""therapy animals."" If you have a medical need to be isolated from animals and you aren't sure they will be taken into account, make sure your nurse knows. If they are dismissive call the charge nurse. These issues may not be readily apparent to nurses.

If you see anything that appears unsafe, against policy, illegal, let medical staff know immediately. People can and do sneak in animals.

If you share a room and you have the slightest hint that someone is trying/thinking about bringing in an animal let staff know. Even if it is allowed, if you object your opinion matters. Even if you cannot stop the visits entirely, you might be able to be moved to a different room, though the more quickly you make your objection known, the better the chance the hospital can respond to it in a timely and beneficial manner.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking at another thread about someone wanting their dog in a hospital setting.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While most institutions outlined prerequisites necessary to allow personal pet visitation, some only required permission from the nursing manager and attending physician.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency of Allowed Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A total of 337 SHEA members and members of the SHEA Research Network (21.7% response of 1,550 members) responded to the survey regarding their institutions’ policies for AHC (Table 6).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95% allowed service animals in some capacity. (83% Internationally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;89% allowed animal assisted activities of some sort. (67% Internationally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% allowed personal pet visits of any kind. (20% Internationally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of those that allowed animals, their access was limited by location for patients and employees. Though conditionally permitted by policy, they had not necessarily been used/permitted there in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of particular note to DF:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Appropriately designed studies are needed to better define the risks and benefits of allowing animals in the healthcare setting for specific purposes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;... insufficient studies are available to produce generalizable, evidence-based recommendations (Table 2); therefore, wide variations exist in policies and practice across healthcare institutions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... because animals have, in general, been excluded from hospitals, experience gained by means of case reports and outbreak investigations is minimal (Table 2). However, general knowledge of zoonotic diseases, case reports, and limited research involving animals in healthcare facilities indicate cause for concern.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In a review of “pet-facilitated therapy” as an aid to psychotherapy, Draper et al14 noted that although a literature review conducted in 1987 revealed more than 1,000 articles on the human-animal bond, only 6 controlled studies evaluating the therapeutic value of animal- assisted activities had been reported as of 1983. These studies concluded that the benefits of animal-assisted activities relied heavily on anecdotal reports and the widespread attachment of persons with animals. In a critical appraisal of the literature from 1986 through 1997, Allen15 concluded that most reports describing the effects of human-canine interactions fell into the lowest category of scientific studies (ie, descriptive studies and expert opinion).&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Newer studies are using controlled experiments, but their findings take time to inform policy. Policymakers and advocates may make decisions from older, less rigorous research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Further, while visitation with pets can be restricted, in theory, to only the individual patient, in practice, this may not be the case, as pets could encounter various HCP, visitors, and patients during their time in the facility. Therefore, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the implications of visitation of a personal pet are guaranteed to be restricted to an individual patient.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Said otherwise, pets should only come in contact with the patient, but it is irresponsible to think that this is how it will actually happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Pets should, in general, be prohibited from entering the healthcare facility, including pets of HCP, patients, and visitors.&lt;/strong&gt; Exceptions can be considered when the healthcare team determines that visitation with a pet would be of benefit to the patient and can be performed with limited risk to the patient, other patients, and healthcare facility as a whole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among several recommendations for policy, exceptions, inappropriate conditions, the paper specifically discusses transport of animals and the location of visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitation is best performed outside of the medical facility whenever possible, consistent with facility rules for leaving the facility under proper supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If outdoor visitation is not possible, visitation should beperformed in a private room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If visitation must occur in a multi-bed room, &lt;strong&gt;explicit permission from the roommate (or roommate’s guardian) and the roommate’s physician must be obtained prior to arrival arriving.&lt;/strong&gt; Animals should be taken directly to the site of visitation, avoiding areas of heavy traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person transporting the animal should prevent the animal from coming into contact with other patients or HCP. [medical staff, nurses, etc.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The pet should be transported in a carrier whenever possible, or on a leash that is &amp;lt;2 m (6 ft) in length. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animals must not be allowed to roam freely in the visitation area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, if you or someone you know is planning to be hospitalized or you know what facility you are likely to be taken to, check ahead about what policies are in place. If you are afraid of animals, have allergies, or have a general objection to animals let facilities staff know to make sure that is in your chart. Make sure your nurse knows so that signage is posted on your door to not bring in &amp;quot;therapy animals.&amp;quot; If you have a medical need to be isolated from animals and you aren&amp;#39;t sure they will be taken into account, make sure your nurse knows. If they are dismissive call the charge nurse. These issues may not be readily apparent to nurses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see anything that appears unsafe, against policy, illegal, let medical staff know immediately. People can and do sneak in animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you share a room and you have the slightest hint that someone is trying/thinking about bringing in an animal let staff know. Even if it is allowed, if you object your opinion matters. Even if you cannot stop the visits entirely, you might be able to be moved to a different room, though the more quickly you make your objection known, the better the chance the hospital can respond to it in a timely and beneficial manner.&lt;/p&gt;

She told me that the manager won't remove them and that she could get them, but it wouldn't do any good; but that she agrees with me that it is unsanitary. I told her ""That is really unsettling, but I suppose there isn't anything I can do. I'll write the health department. Maybe they will do something.""

By the time I went back they were gone, so I don't know what happened. It is a rather large store.

It was after hours on a Friday afternoon so I couldn't get someone at County Health on the phone, but I did draft a letter I am going to send to the management/corporate/health department.

I am going to post to yelp and whatnot. This is **NOT OK.**

================

To whom it may concern:

I am writing about an unfortunate incident that occurred on 2019-05-24 around 1700 at the Sprouts Farmer’s Market (Store #XXX) in XXXXXXXXX, California.

I observed a dog being carried in the deli and salad bar area of the store by a store patron. The owner was carrying the animal and used the salad bar while holding the dog at food-level. Upon seeing this, I spoke to a store employee who referred me to the head cashier. She asked if it was a service animal, in which I replied “I doubt it, given that it is a small fuzzy dog being carried by hand; and even if it is, it is grossly unsanitary to be carrying it unleashed, especially at the salad bar. Generally speaking, I think it is against the law to permit non-service animals into grocery stores.”

The employee was sympathetic but stated that management does not remove people who bring dogs into the store as a general rule, and that she could get the manager, but that it would not likely do anything as it has not been enforced in the past. I thanked her for her candor and stated that I would follow up with corporate and the county health department.

I believe this to be a grossly unsanitary and illegal practice. Per California Health and Safety Code 114259.5-- “**Except as specified in this section, live animals may not be allowed in a food facility.**” Even in the distant possibility that this animal is a service animal per the ADA or H&amp;S 113903, the conduct of the animal owner excepts access per H&amp;S 114259.5(b)(4) “In areas that are not used for food preparation and that are usually open for consumers, such as dining and sales areas, service animals that are controlled by a disabled employee or person, **if a health or safety hazard will not result from the presence or activities of the service animal.**” (emphasis mine.) Customers handling open food products, especially those intended to be eaten without further processing such as salad bar items, while holding or handling a dog is clearly a hazardous practice.

This establishment sells food in open containers (such as the salad bar and bulk foods), and provides an indoor dining area for the purpose of on-premises consumption, increasing the risk to consumers.

I understand that access for disabled persons is important and legally difficult, but not impossible, to verify. I am a disabled person myself and am sensitive to the needs of the community; but the practice of the store is contrary to posted signage (see attachment), accepted standards of food service, California law, and common decency. It is the responsibility of store employees and management to comply with applicable law to ensure that food safety is not compromised and that facility operations are conducted in accordance with applicable law. I believe the management has not only failed to do so, but by its policy of not questioning if animals are service animals or removing non-service animals; *routinely* *and willingly fails* to follow state law by excluding non-service animals or ensuring that lawful service animal owners conduct themselves and their animals in a legal and sanitary method. Management has chosen the route of least effort and/or ignored the law for profit (given it is in the same center as a pet store).

I am requesting that management enforce its policy as written, comply with applicable law, and that the health department will use its regulatory powers to enforce compliance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I was at the grocery Sprouts Farmers Market and a woman and man were shopping together. The lady was wearing a shower cap and the man was carrying a small ratty white dog--&lt;strong&gt;WHILE USING THE SALAD BAR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to an employee who referred me to the head cashier. I told her what happened and she asked if it was a service animal. I said &amp;quot;I doubt it, given that it is a small fuzzy dog being carried by hand; and even if it is, it is grossly unsanitary to be carrying it unleashed, especially at the salad bar. Generally speaking, I think it is against the law to permit non-service animals into grocery stores. (I know it is and had the section memorized).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me that the manager won&amp;#39;t remove them and that she could get them, but it wouldn&amp;#39;t do any good; but that she agrees with me that it is unsanitary. I told her &amp;quot;That is really unsettling, but I suppose there isn&amp;#39;t anything I can do. I&amp;#39;ll write the health department. Maybe they will do something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I went back they were gone, so I don&amp;#39;t know what happened. It is a rather large store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after hours on a Friday afternoon so I couldn&amp;#39;t get someone at County Health on the phone, but I did draft a letter I am going to send to the management/corporate/health department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to post to yelp and whatnot. This is &lt;strong&gt;NOT OK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To whom it may concern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing about an unfortunate incident that occurred on 2019-05-24 around 1700 at the Sprouts Farmer’s Market (Store #XXX) in XXXXXXXXX, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observed a dog being carried in the deli and salad bar area of the store by a store patron. The owner was carrying the animal and used the salad bar while holding the dog at food-level. Upon seeing this, I spoke to a store employee who referred me to the head cashier. She asked if it was a service animal, in which I replied “I doubt it, given that it is a small fuzzy dog being carried by hand; and even if it is, it is grossly unsanitary to be carrying it unleashed, especially at the salad bar. Generally speaking, I think it is against the law to permit non-service animals into grocery stores.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employee was sympathetic but stated that management does not remove people who bring dogs into the store as a general rule, and that she could get the manager, but that it would not likely do anything as it has not been enforced in the past. I thanked her for her candor and stated that I would follow up with corporate and the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

My gf (25) and I (25) recently broke off our 3 year relationship mainly due to the fact that I couldn't deal with her dog (indoor golden), which caused me to start spending less and less time with her. I wish I would have told her before she got this dog that it would ruin our relationship, but I just didn't know at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always grown up with a dog (lab), but we only let it in the house in the mornings or a little bit in the afternoon. We've always had a decent amount of land so we left our dog outside during the day and it would sleep in the garage or dog house at night, whichever she (dog) was feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few months with the dog in our lives and it got to the point where I didn't want to go over to see her as much because her house smelled like dog and there was hair everywhere, she tried to vacuum, but there was still hair everywhere.  I used to always go over to her house for the weekends and spend the night before the dog and then she would do the same and come over to my place for the next weekend, we had a pretty good thing going. When she got the dog she could never come over and stay overnight on the weekends because she didn't want to leave the dog, which meant I had to always go to her place to spend the night on the weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I accepted it (me having to go over to her place on the weekends) because the dog made her happy, but it got to the point where if the dog woke me up I would be in the worst mood. It would put it's head on the bed and just breathe in your face until you either got up or turned over.  There's a few things I really value in life and one of them is quality sleep. We talked about this and we decided that no dog in the bedroom and not on the furniture. Another part that really frustrated me was the affection she would give the dog. I think she hugged and kissed and let that dog lick her more than me, which I didn't think was acceptable, it's nasty to me too because we all know what dogs lick. Then the day came where I was at her place making us dinner and she comes home from work, walks in (door is right at the kitchen) and goes straight to hug and kiss the dog. To say I wasn't pleased with this is an understatement. Here I am making us dinner (I love to cook) and you come in and hug and kiss the dog before me, not acceptable. We talked about this and she understood why I felt that way.

&amp;#x200B;

The no bedroom and no furniture rules helped, but I would always feel nasty and dirty when going over to her house. So the cycle started where I would just want to spend a weekend at my place and want to sleep in my bed, but this started to create problems because we wouldn't see each other enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for her family. She's always grown up with goldens, her parents have 2, nothing wrong with that. I really try to avoid going over to her parents house though because it's 5x as hairy as my gfs house was and then they have....THE SIGN. Let me tell you what this sign in their KITCHEN says...""In our house dog hair is not only a fashion accessory, it's also a condiment."" I can't being to tell you how much this grossed me out when I first saw it and one day I actually had some in my food, I was sooo grossed out. So I really prefer to not go over there, which has caused problems since I never seemed excited for family events.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if that is too much detail? Oh well, I'm already this far. Her dog is also in a breeding program so she doesn't own the dog until it's done in like 5-7 years, but she does get to keep her golden for free at the end of the program. I'm not going to get into detail here, but that dog is a huge liability if something happens and it's not able to breed. I'm talking a full year salary for an average college grad! Another part of the agreement is to take the dog to the breeder when it's time and just randomly throughout the month for potential buyers to see what the litters parent look like. It's actually a really good program for people buying the puppies.

&amp;#x200B;

So all of this put together really put a strain on myself and I didn't think that I could be happy if we moved on to engagement and marriage. I love this girl so much and when we ended things it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and I'm still struggling with the decision. I wish I could go back before she got the dog and tell her this would ruin everything because I still love her, but let her go mainly because of dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not really sure what I'm looking for, but its been extremely difficult coping with the idea of a dog ruining this great relationship with the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Dogs completely ruined the 3 year relationship that my gf and I had built and we ended it even though I still love her greatly.

I can't express enough how relieved I am that there is a dogfree community on Reddit, a place filled with dog lovers. Due to some reasons, I am using a throwaway account to post this - I don't want to receive hate on my main account just because I don't like dogs. This is going to be a long post, so I apologize for it. Sorry if I post this twice, my first post was removed and I deleted this. Well, here we go-


As I said, I'm a cat person. I think that cats are very clean animals and I absolutely love them! I used to live with two cats - one of them which was a eight year old Persian cat, named Margaery - until a couple of years ago, when my dad decided to adopt a dog. Since my house is small, the dog was small too: he got a small Shih Tzu, which he named... well, whatever. I'll just name him as Dog #1. 



Dog #1 is always sick somehow and my dad has spent up to $500 in medical bills ever since he adopted him. I didn't paid too much attention to the dog because, well, I don't really like dogs - then, the dog started trying to have sex with the old Persian cat. She was a very frail cat and was always quiet, loved sleeping on people's laps and rarely meowed - I had to shoo away the dog since he was hurting her. But he never stopped trying, so my dad decide to give the cat to a family friend, where she would definitely be safe. I wasn't too happy with it, but I got over it. 



For some reason, even though my dad tried to train him, Dog #1 always pees and shits whenever he wants. Dad takes walks with him everyday and yet he everyday on the living room - which is next to my room. Nice, right?



The nightmare started last year, when my mom decided to adopt three dogs. I don't have a good relationship with her and this definitely made it worse. All three dogs are shih tzus, and I hate them for so many reasons. Dog #2 has respiratory issues and he's aggressive, constantly fighting with Dog #3 who's simply annoying and barks at everything. Dog #4 is a female dog and is very old, but she's the one I hate the most: She's tiny and can't do anything by herself. If she wants to get on my mom's bed, she'll growl and bark until someone puts her on it, and if she wants to get down, she'll growl and bark until someone puts her down. If you're eating and she's close, she'll growl until you give her a bite of whatever you're eating. And she's FULL of fleas!



My house stinks and I never bring any friends home because I'm so embarassed. The dogs always bark like hell at any slight noise, and they never stop barking, not even if you tell them to shut up. When I try to get Dog #1 out of my room so he won't pee on it, he growls at me. And Dog #4 is always on my room even though I shoo her away - sometimes I find fleas on my bed because of her and my legs are full of flea bites. 


I can't wait to move. I plan to move with a friend and split bills, I just hate dogs so much and I can't stand to be near them - their bark is so annoying. Thankfully, my cat takes no shit from no dog and tries to claw whoever tries to hurt her, but my family hates her so badly. Whenever she meows, my mom loudly tells her to shut up - but when her shitty dogs bark, she doesn't says anything.



The dogs always pee on the bathroom floor, it stinks so bad. It's such a disgusting and strong smell. Sorry if it doesn't seems like a bad situation, but I can't stand it anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, Reddit!

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I&amp;#39;m a cat person. I think that cats are very clean animals and I absolutely love them! I used to live with two cats - one of them which was a eight year old Persian cat, named Margaery - until a couple of years ago, when my dad decided to adopt a dog. Since my house is small, the dog was small too: he got a small Shih Tzu, which he named... well, whatever. I&amp;#39;ll just name him as Dog #1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog #1 is always sick somehow and my dad has spent up to $500 in medical bills ever since he adopted him. I didn&amp;#39;t paid too much attention to the dog because, well, I don&amp;#39;t really like dogs - then, the dog started trying to have sex with the old Persian cat. She was a very frail cat and was always quiet, loved sleeping on people&amp;#39;s laps and rarely meowed - I had to shoo away the dog since he was hurting her. But he never stopped trying, so my dad decide to give the cat to a family friend, where she would definitely be safe. I wasn&amp;#39;t too happy with it, but I got over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, even though my dad tried to train him, Dog #1 always pees and shits whenever he wants. Dad takes walks with him everyday and yet he everyday on the living room - which is next to my room. Nice, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nightmare started last year, when my mom decided to adopt three dogs. I don&amp;#39;t have a good relationship with her and this definitely made it worse. All three dogs are shih tzus, and I hate them for so many reasons. Dog #2 has respiratory issues and he&amp;#39;s aggressive, constantly fighting with Dog #3 who&amp;#39;s simply annoying and barks at everything. Dog #4 is a female dog and is very old, but she&amp;#39;s the one I hate the most: She&amp;#39;s tiny and can&amp;#39;t do anything by herself. If she wants to get on my mom&amp;#39;s bed, she&amp;#39;ll growl and bark until someone puts her on it, and if she wants to get down, she&amp;#39;ll growl and bark until someone puts her down. If you&amp;#39;re eating and she&amp;#39;s close, she&amp;#39;ll growl until you give her a bite of whatever you&amp;#39;re eating. And she&amp;#39;s FULL of fleas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My house stinks and I never bring any friends home because I&amp;#39;m so embarassed. The dogs always bark like hell at any slight noise, and they never stop barking, not even if you tell them to shut up. When I try to get Dog #1 out of my room so he won&amp;#39;t pee on it, he growls at me. And Dog #4 is always on my room even though I shoo her away - sometimes I find fleas on my bed because of her and my legs are full of flea bites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to move. I plan to move with a friend and split bills, I just hate dogs so much and I can&amp;#39;t stand to be near them - their bark is so annoying. Thankfully, my cat takes no shit from no dog and tries to claw whoever tries to hurt her, but my family hates her so badly. Whenever she meows, my mom loudly tells her to shut up - but when her shitty dogs bark, she doesn&amp;#39;t says anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogs always pee on the bathroom floor, it stinks so bad. It&amp;#39;s such a disgusting and strong smell. Sorry if it doesn&amp;#39;t seems like a bad situation, but I can&amp;#39;t stand it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason dog nuts become so unreasonably offended when people don't like dogs is because they know deep down that their dogs are nasty creatures, and they the owner are likely nasty themselves. They know. That's why they get so triggered and angry when they're called out on it. Because people see them and their worthless mutts for what they truly are.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason dog nuts become so unreasonably offended when people don&amp;#39;t like dogs is because they know deep down that their dogs are nasty creatures, and they the owner are likely nasty themselves.

Being surrounded by people who love dogs gets... tiring, to say the least. 
What’s up with carefree owners who let their dogs freely roam the streets? I hate it so much. 
They let their vicious dogs roam around, killing whatever they’d like. It makes my blood boil! 
I’ve lost 4 wonderful (outside) cats to these damn creatures. Sadly, the dogs always get away before I can get a good look at them and call the pound on them. 
I’ve been so bothered lately by dogs ever since I was told that my cat got killed by one. But heaven forbid I say I don’t like dogs in front of a dog owner! 
Dog enthusiasts love to claim “dogs are all friendly!!! hehe! cats are just mean!” no! not all dogs are friendly! It takes a LOT of training to get your dog to do basic things like not pee everywhere or not to jump on people (or hump for that matter)... dogs are just plain annoying! I just can’t deal with the high energy of a dog. Sure, cats can be mean but that’s no reason to get so worked up about someone having a different opinion and preferring another animal more.
These owners take it as a challenge when I politely say that I’m not fond of dogs and get weirdly defensive... I get you have an emotional bond to your animal but just because you love them, doesn’t mean other people will enjoy them or have to enjoy them!
Dogs are so smelly and just... nasty. 
I know this is a very dramatic thing to say but dogs ruin almost anything they can get their jaw on! Taking the life of a small and innocent creature, hurting people and children, tearing couches/destroying furniture.. going # 1 and # 2 all over the place? Like...????? What a destructive thing to let inside a home! They stink the whooole place up to top it off! 🤢
Just let the people who don’t like dogs be. It’s usually for a good reason that we don’t like dogs! 
It’s nice that these people care a lot about an animal’s life! It makes me glad to see these people put so much love into taking care of their dogs but please keep your smelly mutt away from my butt! (ba dum tssh!)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that I’ve finally found my safe spot with this Reddit! Being surrounded by people who love dogs gets... tiring, to say the least. 
What’s up with carefree owners who let their dogs freely roam the streets? I hate it so much. 
They let their vicious dogs roam around, killing whatever they’d like. It makes my blood boil! 
I’ve lost 4 wonderful (outside) cats to these damn creatures. Sadly, the dogs always get away before I can get a good look at them and call the pound on them. 
I’ve been so bothered lately by dogs ever since I was told that my cat got killed by one. But heaven forbid I say I don’t like dogs in front of a dog owner!

**\[Comment\] How dare we not support aggressive dogs?**

Whatever who's not supporting this animals should be a shame because animals are what you made them so you should instruct yourself and stop being ignorant. People like you guys disgust me I think you guys should burn in hell not support animals we have so many problems with pits because they getting owned by ignoring people just like you so shut your trap and get a f\*\*\*\*\*\* life cuz you probably don't even own a pet because you guys cannot even take care of yourselves.

Title: Why do you people even hate dogs so much???

Post:

Pretty much everyone on this sub thinks a dog will maul them to death for no reason. Im a proud owner of a pitbull (or as you call them “shitbulls”). My dog won’t maul you to death, I think you need to learn that. My dog just wants to be friendly and you guys think it’s a killing machine. Dogs have been proven to be so helpful to humans but this sub just can’t take the facts, huh?

They’re loving, kind and gentle animals but you guys seem to worship the cats instead. You say that we’re “dog nutters” and we worship dogs while your over there with your cat shrine. Cats will not love you, they’re just using you for food. If you were dying a cat would do nothing about it, a dog would save you.

This sub is constantly full about rare articles about dog attacks happening, most of them are misunderstood, it’s not the dog’s fault it’s the “victim’s” fault. Dogs will never attack without reason or warning (where as cats constantly scratch). These poor dogs are put down for attacking when they feel threatened. You don’t put down humans for self defence...

Why are you scared of dogs attacking anyways? Toasters kill people but you don’t see people stop using toasters....

This is my opinion which is based on facts

P.s. God made dogs mans best friend for a reason, you don’t see cats being mans best friend, do you?

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Comment\] On a post about the increasing amount of pointless dog-related news.**

OMG sooooo sick. It’s 2019, ALL news should pertain to ME and me alone. Fuck the fact that the overwhelming majority of people enjoy dogs and stories like these. I don’t want to understand them and I WILL NOT TOLERATE OTHER OPINIONS

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Post\] Get your bingo cards out for this one (Spell-check lit this one up like a Christmas Tree).**

Title: just a dog lover trying to find some common ground

Post:

ok hi so i found out about this reddit from markiplier and i spent a few minutes looking st this subreddit. im definitely not against yall disliking dogs, but it seems like this subreddit was made out of ignorance? i have a dog and its honestly the sweetest most pure thing in my life. i understand some of you were traumatized by a dog, causing you to develop a phobia. but have u considered maybe trying to change that mindset? im not saying its easy to get over a phobia but if you could just be more openminded about dogs and the benefits they give to humans then maybe just maybe you can start to tolerate dogs a bit more.

if you were bitten by a dog and have trauma becos of it, have u considered maybe getting some help to get over it?

another thing i see is a lot of you thing dogs are gross. that is very true. my dogs eats stuff off the street, he licks other dog’s piss etc, but you must remember dogs are animals??? lol. just like lions or wolves in the wild, they roll around in elephant poop and self clean their assholes.

i dont want to seem like im attacking you guys. not liking dogs is totally fine. but there is a quote that i like very much that says, “there are no bad dogs, just bad people.” its unfortunately that there are violent dogs in this world, but from what i see in this subreddit, you guys dont actually hate dogs, but you hate the root of the problem. which is a lot of the times, humans. pitbulls are a great example. pitbulls were bred to fight, greyhounds were bred to race. but in reality they are really chill dogs. saying that pitbulls are violent and ugly is just judging them based on their appearance??? and thats not right

is it so can i just ask yall a favor, just give dogs a chance. so many of them are so loving, loyal, funny, intelligent animals. a lot of you are just unfamiliar with dogs, you never had a dog that had a positive impact on you. if you just expose yourself and try to understand these creatures, i think you wouldnt have to waste your energy on hating an innocent dog

**Response to this post from our very own** u/AlterEgo1081

No - we don't just dislike owners, we hate dogs.

No - our minds aren't changing.

No - we've given them a zillion chances.

No - we don't like your dog either.

I'm just giving you a brief summary of the responses that you would get from the sub so that I can save them all some time. We get ""concern"" posts like the practically daily, and it's not what the sub wants, so sorry that you spent time on it. This sub simply may not be for you.

**And OP's response to** u/Alterego1081's **comment:**

thank you for responding truly. im sorry that you hate dogs, but i dont think i wasted my time on this subreddit. i respect your preferences, but it just seems your mindset is a bit stubborn thats all.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Post\] Shut the sub down. We're the problem after all! Mystery solved.**

Title: Your the problem

Post:

You sound like the problem. The owner says the dog is fine. The neighbor says the dog is fine. The cop says the dog is fine. Even by your own description, it sounds like the dog tries to play with you. Your just an idiot

I bet you moved to the neighborhood, and now want everyone to live by your rules instead of adapting to thiers!!

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Comment\] Another one who thinks he/she/they has us all figured out.**

Exams are stressful and dogs are really good at helping people calm down your all just a bunch of fucking pricks who hate dogs

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Post\] Let’s tone it down a bit guys. We really do make every dog seem that bad. /s**

Title: just don't be irrational

Post:

not every dog is a bad dog its just stereotypes pitbulls can be dangerous but, look at it this way is it wrong for you to defend yourself is it wrong for dogs to be scared and irrational at times? no its not so i understand if you don't like dogs i just wondered if you could not make it seem like every dog is bad ?

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Comment\] So what I’m hearing you say is that it’s not my fault I’m a dog-hating asshole; it’s my parents’ fault.**

Stop hating the dog and hate the owner okay you guys act like it's the dogs fault all the time but it's those dumb neglectful owners. Think of you being adopted but you are treated terrible and forced to be a jerk... it's not your fault

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Comment\] I guess we don’t explain what’s wrong with dogs well enough. We’re such sorrow jerks.**

I find this sub Reddit hating the dogs actions and not the owners... I thought this place would be people explaining what's wrong with dogs and what they prefer but no... it's just a dumb hole that's filled with a bunch of sorrow jerks... But no just people bringing out anger on all dogs when just one ruined there life.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Post\] The incel argument again, huh?**

Title: It’s amazing how delusional this sub is

Post:

I just see a bunch of articles of dogs killing people or other animals, as if humans haven’t killed way more animals and people than dogs have. Everyone here is so bitter and if you participate in a subreddit dedicated to hating dogs, you’re in no place to call other people “nutcases”. It’s fine to not like dogs but this sub takes it to another level. You’re like a bunch of incels, but instead of hating women you hate dogs and shit on everyone who owns one.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Comment\] From the same person who posted the incel argument above.**

&lt;p&gt;Title: just a dog lover trying to find some common ground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok hi so i found out about this reddit from markiplier and i spent a few minutes looking st this subreddit. im definitely not against yall disliking dogs, but it seems like this subreddit was made out of ignorance? i have a dog and its honestly the sweetest most pure thing in my life. i understand some of you were traumatized by a dog, causing you to develop a phobia. but have u considered maybe trying to change that mindset? im not saying its easy to get over a phobia but if you could just be more openminded about dogs and the benefits they give to humans then maybe just maybe you can start to tolerate dogs a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you were bitten by a dog and have trauma becos of it, have u considered maybe getting some help to get over it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another thing i see is a lot of you thing dogs are gross. that is very true. my dogs eats stuff off the street, he licks other dog’s piss etc, but you must remember dogs are animals??? lol. just like lions or wolves in the wild, they roll around in elephant poop and self clean their assholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i dont want to seem like im attacking you guys. not liking dogs is totally fine. but there is a quote that i like very much that says, “there are no bad dogs, just bad people.” its unfortunately that there are violent dogs in this world, but from what i see in this subreddit, you guys dont actually hate dogs, but you hate the root of the problem. which is a lot of the times, humans. pitbulls are a great example. pitbulls were bred to fight, greyhounds were bred to race. but in reality they are really chill dogs. saying that pitbulls are violent and ugly is just judging them based on their appearance??? and thats not right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is it so can i just ask yall a favor, just give dogs a chance. so many of them are so loving, loyal, funny, intelligent animals. a lot of you are just unfamiliar with dogs, you never had a dog that had a positive impact on you. if you just expose yourself and try to understand these creatures, i think you wouldnt have to waste your energy on hating an innocent dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to this post from our very own&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/AlterEgo1081""&gt;u/AlterEgo1081&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No - we don&amp;#39;t just dislike owners, we hate dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No - our minds aren&amp;#39;t changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No - we&amp;#39;ve given them a zillion chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No - we don&amp;#39;t like your dog either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just giving you a brief summary of the responses that you would get from the sub so that I can save them all some time. We get &amp;quot;concern&amp;quot; posts like the practically daily, and it&amp;#39;s not what the sub wants, so sorry that you spent time on it. This sub simply may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And OP&amp;#39;s response to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/Alterego1081""&gt;u/Alterego1081&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;comment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you for responding truly. im sorry that you hate dogs, but i dont think i wasted my time on this subreddit. i respect your preferences, but it just seems your mindset is a bit stubborn thats all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Post] Shut the sub down. We&amp;#39;re the problem after all! Mystery solved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: Your the problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sound like the problem. The owner says the dog is fine. The neighbor says the dog is fine. The cop says the dog is fine. Even by your own description, it sounds like the dog tries to play with you. Your just an idiot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet you moved to the neighborhood, and now want everyone to live by your rules instead of adapting to thiers!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Comment] Another one who thinks he/she/they has us all figured out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exams are stressful and dogs are really good at helping people calm down your all just a bunch of fucking pricks who hate dogs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Post] Let’s tone it down a bit guys. We really do make every dog seem that bad. /s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: just don&amp;#39;t be irrational&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not every dog is a bad dog its just stereotypes pitbulls can be dangerous but, look at it this way is it wrong for you to defend yourself is it wrong for dogs to be scared and irrational at times? no its not so i understand if you don&amp;#39;t like dogs i just wondered if you could not make it seem like every dog is bad ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Comment] So what I’m hearing you say is that it’s not my fault I’m a dog-hating asshole; it’s my parents’ fault.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop hating the dog and hate the owner okay you guys act like it&amp;#39;s the dogs fault all the time but it&amp;#39;s those dumb neglectful owners. Think of you being adopted but you are treated terrible and forced to be a jerk... it&amp;#39;s not your fault&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Comment] I guess we don’t explain what’s wrong with dogs well enough. We’re such sorrow jerks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this sub Reddit hating the dogs actions and not the owners... I thought this place would be people explaining what&amp;#39;s wrong with dogs and what they prefer but no... it&amp;#39;s just a dumb hole that&amp;#39;s filled with a bunch of sorrow jerks... But no just people bringing out anger on all dogs when just one ruined there life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Post] The incel argument again, huh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: It’s amazing how delusional this sub is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just see a bunch of articles of dogs killing people or other animals, as if humans haven’t killed way more animals and people than dogs have. Everyone here is so bitter and if you participate in a subreddit dedicated to hating dogs, you’re in no place to call other people “nutcases”. It’s fine to not like dogs but this sub takes it to another level. You’re like a bunch of incels, but instead of hating women you hate dogs and shit on everyone who owns one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Comment] From the same person who posted the incel argument above.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with liking dogs more than people though. Not everyone likes people.&lt;/p&gt;

A Virginia woman died of rabies after being bitten by a dog infected with the virus in India, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed. It happened last spring, after the 65-year-old returned home from an extended stay in India for a yoga retreat. 

Doctors questioned her family about animal exposures and her husband told them that she had been bitten on the right hand by a puppy outside her hotel in Rishikesh, India, about 6 weeks before her symptoms began. He said his wife cleaned the wound with the help of the tour operator but did not seek further medical treatment. She did not receive a rabies pre-exposure vaccination before the trip, and had never been vaccinated against rabies.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman's condition continued to worsen, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. On May 11, eight days after the woman's first symptoms appeared, rabies was confirmed. Experimental treatments failed to work, and the woman died 10 days later.

This was before I realized just how bad dog nuttery has gotten.

I had just moved in with my new husband at the time  (divorced now). He had 4 medium size dogs. One terrier type dog and the other 3 were English Springer Spaniels. 

I brought my then 3 year old daughter over for the first time and she was just walking around the house when one of the spaniels nipped at her. I told my then husband. His response? ""My Dogs Don't don't do that!"".

But I know what I saw so I held my daughter as long as I could but at one point I had to set her down again and I had asked my then-husband to put the dogs outside while my daughter was there. Well he did but when I was in the bathroom he let them back in. We were all in the living room and sure enough that little spaniel comes up and nips at my daughter again. I look at my then husband and I said ""see I told you that dog nipped at my daughter"". And he said ""well your daughter shouldn't be so hyperactive around my dogs"". She was 3!!

Another problem I had with those damn dogs is they would get in my underwear drawer and chew up on my underwear. I addressed this with my then husband and his response was ""my dogs don't do that!"" 

Those dogs would get into the bathroom trash can and tear up the toilet paper and have it strewn about the house and when I would gripe about it he would, of course, say ""my dogs don't do that!""

What kind of BS nuttery is this? How can a person be so delusional? The dog nipped my daughter and it was her fault even though she was 3 years old. The dogs chewed on my underwear but then husband said his dogs wouldn't do that, well I guess I must have chewed on my own underwear then because apparently that's more plausible than his damn dogs doing it. And then his dog's obviously got in the bathroom trash but oh no his dogs couldn't possibly have done that even though they were literally the only ones in the house that would do such a thing. This dog nuttery is getting out of control. How can a person be in such denial about how bad their dogs are?

I’ve composed the following message on paper that I’ll pass out to houses around my neighborhood that have outdoor dogs.

“Dear Dog Owner,

I am a nearby neighbor and I recently noticed your dog barking continuously at certain times of the day. Most often I hear the barking between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.. I don't know if you are home during these hours or if the dog only barks when you are away. Since I work at night, the barking is very disturbing and disruptive for me. If you could please work to keep your dog quiet, I would appreciate it greatly. I am afraid if it continues to be disruptive for me I will need to call Animal Control.

Thank you,

However what baffled me more is the  following comment where they just skip a beat about being wrong about calling someone something inflammatory that they aren't into spouting some nonsense about dog attacks being 80% chihuahuas and i quote ''  I watched now. XD You said dogs kill people but 80% of dog's attack are chihuahuas but chihuahuas are so weak to kill a human. I guess we need 20 chihuahuas to kill a human. '' what kind of non sequitur is this? It's borderline comedic, ignoring insulting someone and going straight to well  chichis are harmless therefore nothing bad is clearly being done by dogs.  So i decided to go hunting for statistics to demonstrate my point and found an handy website  [https://www.maxlawsc.com/dog-bite-statistics/](https://www.maxlawsc.com/dog-bite-statistics/)  that essentially has clear information of number of reported incidents, severity of incidents reporting in hospitalisation and fatality statistics. Essentially there are more reported fatalities for dog attacks annually than there are fatalities in school shootings annually( for example 43 to 22 respectively in 2014 ) with the exception being 2018 according to the data provided by  [https://www.chds.us/ssdb/](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/) and 2018's result is more anomalous and is likely due to increased media coverage leading to increased copycat events . That alone is an insane statistic, never mind higher averages of fatalities per year and number of reported incidents, so the likelihood of being caught in one of the events is significantly higher with less safety precautions around it for animal attacks. Coming on here and seeing the sheer quantity of reports of attacks/murders by these monsters is really highlighted by the insane stats on display. So to have all of that trivialised by '' well muh chichi is harmless so your attack stats are invalid '' is disgusting. Dog culture is truly nuts and i didn't know what to classify this as tag wise so i just went with culture since it's sort of a commentary on how blind people really are to dangers of having predators near the children and eldery. Besides being straight up disgusting which is subjective, they are unhygienic, smelly, noisy, clingy and flat out dangerous. Is there a reason to have these foul shitbeasts in our society?

Two people allowed to enter Wayside Elementary School as volunteer readers earlier this month have criminal records, according to the Kern County Superior Court.

&amp;#x200B;

Ann Ardell has seven entries in the online court system, while Jeff Jones has 13. While each had several arrests involving crimes such as theft, trespassing and obstructing an officer, many of these offenses were dismissed and neither person saw much jail time, according to court records.

&amp;#x200B;

Ardell and Jones brought two dogs that appear to be akita or chow mixes to the school on May 9 during a trip to read with second-grade students. After the reading, students were given permission to pet the dogs. One of the students, 8-year-old Leilani Rivera, was seriously injured after being bitten in the face by one of the dogs.

We bought our first one from a pet store (A) and our second from some weird people that couldn't take care of him anymore (B). That's fine, two dogs are manageable. Shit hit the fan when we moved to a new house before my first year of high school and my mom got into dog fostering.

Basically, my parents got attached to too many of the dogs we fostered. My dad and I finally convinced my mom to stop fostering after the ninth one, partly be aide of all the other dogs we had and partly because the other two dogs we were fostering at the time really tore the house up, including chewing on furniture and eating the blinds. So all during high school I had the luxury of 6-9 untrained dogs pissing and shitting all over the house and hearing them all bark at the top of their lungs when someone leaves, when someone opens or closes a door, or just randomly because they feel like it. Only about half chip in for the random sessions, so they sound less hellish which is nice I guess. Now even the slightest boof is enough to stress me out and distract me from whatever I was doing. I wrecked my voice trying to get them all to shut up to no avail, so I started slamming doors and pounding on walls to get their attention which my mom didn't like lol (recently I found clapping very loudly can help, too). Even she yells at them to shut up, but they don't listen to her/can't hear her over their own barking. This is especially fun when I'm on the phone with someone. Btw I have adhd so I need the least amount of distractions possible to function properly :^). This made trying to get any homework done in high school fucking obnoxious. Eventually I just stopped giving a fuck to be honest. 

Having so many dogs is part of the reason I don't have a social life. I can't have people over with nine dogs barking at them while pissing and shitting all over the place, including on the sitting room couch and armchair! I basically have to keep my home life a secret from people because holy shit. It's petty, but I think all the cortisol pumping through my veins from all the horrible noises has affected my appearance, especially my skin. I'm not even 20 and I have permanent eyebags and probably other signs of premature aging.

I love my mom but she's one of those people that does nothing to train animals, spoils them with table food and letting them in bed, and anthropomorphizing them. She thinks the dog is smiling because he's panting with his mouth open wide, when he's actually stressed from scrating his ass all day because he's allergic to grass of all things. Other than a horribly unhygienic living situation, the dogs have food, clean water, are groomed, and are taken to the vet when needed, which is better than nothing.

I don't hate these dogs at all, we just shouldn't have so many of them at once. They're good dogs at heart (except maybe one), never snapping at humans and would do pretty well in a more structured environment. We really need to rehome at least half of them though. It sucks because the dogs are attached to each other and the family, but living like this isn't healthy for anyone. Most of the time whenever giving them away is brought up, it's kind of brushed off with an ""awww"", but it's something we really need to do. Nobody should have so many dogs, period.

Tl;Dr: Nine barking dogs that piss and shit everywhere and it's really affected my life in a negative way.

Also I put a lot of blame on my mom for things because she's the worst offender, but I don't think my dad and I are completely blameless either. We all need to take responsibility for our situation.

I live in a small lake community an hour north of Houston. For the past few months, a pack of 6-7 small dogs have been terrorizing the neighborhood. They would come on to our property repeatedly, and we would shoo them off. They're not large dogs. They appear to be mainly beagle and terrier breeds. However, today it got much worse. I was the only one home and my neighbors were not home. The dogs went crazy running through my neighbor's property. I went out to yell at them, and they barked at me, sending me back inside. Then I heard a cat. I listened to the cat being killed. At this point, I went on the community's facebook group and let the neighborhood know that the dogs were loose again and that a cat had died. I could see them playing with the cat's corpse through my kitchen window. The cat must have tried to find refuge under my neighbor's house at some point, because the dogs broke the skirting and were also running around underneath it.   


After posting it to the Facebook group, a different neighbor got home from work. She does animal rescue, both wild and domestic animals, and she saw my post and came over. She likes dogs, and has fostered four on her acreage, but is tired of this group of malnourished dogs running around with a pack mentality. She puts on gloves and discovers the cat is just a little kitten, maybe 8 weeks old. We go to confront the owner of the dog. It's a woman who doesn't speak English and we need to involve a high school student as a translator. The dogs' owner says she doesn't want the dogs anymore but is not sure what to do. As people often dump dogs here, I don't find her story implausible. She likely kept taking in dumped dogs, and now we have this mess. And my guess is she likely sees animal control as law enforcement, and has been hesitant to call them herself. But my neighbor was pretty adamant that these dogs need not get outside of the yard again, as they have been reaping terror on the neighborhood and she now has to bury a kitten. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, we got back to our part of the neighborhood, and at this point my elderly neighbors who owned the property where the kitten died are back. I let them know what happened, and I found out it wasn't their kitten, and now they also have to  repair their skirting where it was ripped. And then a few hours later, I heard the mamma cat show up. She's been crying for a few hours, looking for the kitten. I don't know what to do, I think they may be stray/feral themselves. I put out some canned chicken for her on a little plate, hoping I can slowly get her to trust me so I can take her to SPCA.   


But I'm still left with a chance the dogs may come back. If they do, I won't be able to get animal control out here by the time they will run back off the property. This leaves me with the option of live trapping them. So now, I get to google how on earth I can live trap a pack of 6-7 dogs.

Now, I've grown up with dogs so I've always been relatively chill with them, although it has grown more apparent to me in recent years just how much of a burden they are to own. The simple things like wanting to go for a late night drink or crash out of town for a night become logistical nightmares. Anyway, I was due for a second date with this chick today. The weather was nice but it turns out she owns a young dog and didn't want to leave it at home alone due to her fucked up family not wanting to ever dog-sit (despite already owning 2 other dogs?) so I suggested going for a walk and letting the dog tag along. No harm in that right? Naturally, that was my first mistake. Dogs suck.

I've always carried the opinion that dogs reflect their owner on some level. If they're unruly, in my experience it's typically due to one of several possible flaws on the part of the owner. The bad behaviour could result from anything: laziness, insecurity, coddling, aggressiveness - you name it. Now, call me judgemental and/or crazy (because you wouldn't be wrong tbh) but from negatively associating the dogs behaviour with the owner, I almost always end up involuntarily psycho-analysing the person on some level through semi-dramatic leaps in logic such as:

*You don't care about your dog harassing people in public, you probably don't care much for manners and the boundaries of others;*      
*Your dog chokes itself to death because you haven't leash trained it, you're probably one of those anti-discipline types and use your pet as glorified toy.*      etc.

Anyway to cut a long story short, badly behaved dogs stress me out and it should go without saying that this girl's dog was a nightmare. Not the best date ever but she's smart/witty company so 6/10 - less dog next time.

As for the dark bit, the main reason I felt compelled to rant here however is that during the walk back home, my date divulges a little more about her family situation. At the risk of sounding incredibly callous, the TLDR is that her family environment is incredibly toxic and abusive in various ways. Now I wouldn't wish her situation on anyone because from what little she shared it sounds vile and naturally that's only the tip of the iceberg so I do feel guilty complaining about this. However, I still can't quite get my head around the ignorance involved with bringing a dog into an environment which is that unhealthy, made worse by her nMom forcing her to keep the dog locked in her room like 24/7. Like why the fuck would you do that to yourself or the dog? She's clearly dealt with a lot of emotional issues both in the past and present, but why would a dog be a suitable crutch in a situation like that? Even if her reasoning is for companionship and a form of emotional support, it's just restricting her and fucking her over in the long-run as it becomes 10x harder to rent with a pet, as well as all the money she's sinking on it's injections and insurance. But hey, she refuses to give up the dog under any circumstance even though it's clear her life would be far easier if she re-homed it and focused on her mental health and moving the hell away from her parents ASAP.

Needless to say, the behaviour of the dog suddenly became a lot more explainable once I'd learned about the environment it was being raised in and the difficulties the girl is going through. I suppose I just find it equal parts upsetting and baffling that someone could be so seduced by the prospect of dog ownership when you're knowingly bringing the poor thing into an unhealthy and borderline abusive environment and actively contributing another layer of difficulty to your already fucked up situation.

I just found this sub and thought I'd do a first post about this recent encounter with a small dog.

I invited a friend over to a family BBQ and they brought their pug (if I knew they were going to bring it I would have never invited them... they didn't ask because I usually tell them to leave it home unless we're at a park or somewhere open). I'm pretty straight forward with this friend, but they are also sensitive so I try my best to not be so blunt although at times I can be a dick.

My immediate family is pretty germophobic, and don't believe dogs should be in the house because they smell awful, jump on furniture, drool, and get their hair, shit and piss particles on everything (I agree). Anyway on to the point, there's something about little dogs that just irks me and this experience served to reinforce these feelings. I can tolerate bigger dogs like labs that are well groomed and well behaved, but most dog owners are neglectful when it comes to their hygiene and training.

I find that smaller dogs with short hair have a stronger, more concentrated stench. When this friend shows up at the gate, carrying the pug in arms, my family just stops talking and looks over lol I already know what they are thinking. The kids at the gathering instantly get hyped up which in turn gets the dog hyper as hell. My friend sets it down and I notice a cloud of loose fur falling onto the deck. As soon as it's on the deck this thing darts to the kids and you can already smell it- stinks like doritos mixed with dirty gym socks. 

In no time it starts jumping on the kids, darting back and forth from the deck onto the grass, it's tongue sticking out and gasping for air because it's a pug and they are just genetic experiments on par with chihuahuas. When it finally calms down the thing squats and decides to take a shit exactly in the spot where the kids are playing. If I didn't catch it happening they would have stepped in it, because my friend made no effort to clean it up so I went to grab a bag and some paper towels which I handed to them (I imagine their yard is full of turds, something I've noticed other dog owners allow when their dog is outside). 

Food was ready at some point and kids were told to wash their hands because they were touching the pug and letting it lick them. Friend repeats the common myth about ""dogs mouths are cleaner than a humans"" and I interrupt and tell them no, that's a myth. I could tell my friend was annoyed by that lol. While we were all eating- the thing kept begging for food and getting up close to everyone, getting on its hind legs and digging its sharp claws into people's laps. Friend makes no effort to correct the dogs behavior ""oh he doesn't do this at home"" (bullshit) 

Some of us finish and go into an enclosed gazebo, as does my friend who of course lets the dog inside where it jumps onto the sofa and sets its little black asshole on the cushions, the thing recently took a deuce so naturally turd particles are now on the cushions. We're all hanging out in the gazebo with the smelly dog unable to sit still, moving off the sofa to the floor, knocking over decorations, back to the sofa and so forth. I try my best to ignore it but eventually air my grievances about how annoying the dog is. 

A little later we all went into the family room/basement which has a clean freshly poured concrete floor. As soon as we are all inside, the dog which was just outside seconds ago decides to squat and take another shit on the fucking floor ""oh he doesn't normally do this at home!"" Again bullshit, I can tell at this point that the thing is so poorly trained it probably shits and pisses inside all of the time. In fact I've been to this friends place and I remember the dog having ""accidents"" on more than one occasion so yes this does happen at home. I hand my friend another bag to clean up after it, and not a second later the thing hops onto the sofa with it's exposed little asshole on the clean cushions. Didn't want to be an ass again but aired my grievance about the dogs anus on the sofa. I could already see the hair it was dropping all over the sofa. At that point it was the end of the night so I was just glad it would be leaving soon. 

Before my friend leaves they said something like ""I feel like no one likes my dog"" I actually laughed out loud and I reassured them that it's nothing personal we just think dogs are dirty and annoying for the most part. I didn't have the heart to just say ""don't ever bring that thing around me again"" but if they didn't get the hint I'll have to be more blunt the next time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the poor flow in the writing and documenting of the experience. I just found this sub and thought I&amp;#39;d do a first post about this recent encounter with a small dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invited a friend over to a family BBQ and they brought their pug (if I knew they were going to bring it I would have never invited them... they didn&amp;#39;t ask because I usually tell them to leave it home unless we&amp;#39;re at a park or somewhere open). I&amp;#39;m pretty straight forward with this friend, but they are also sensitive so I try my best to not be so blunt although at times I can be a dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate family is pretty germophobic, and don&amp;#39;t believe dogs should be in the house because they smell awful, jump on furniture, drool, and get their hair, shit and piss particles on everything (I agree). Anyway on to the point, there&amp;#39;s something about little dogs that just irks me and this experience served to reinforce these feelings. I can tolerate bigger dogs like labs that are well groomed and well behaved, but most dog owners are neglectful when it comes to their hygiene and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that smaller dogs with short hair have a stronger, more concentrated stench. When this friend shows up at the gate, carrying the pug in arms, my family just stops talking and looks over lol I already know what they are thinking. The kids at the gathering instantly get hyped up which in turn gets the dog hyper as hell. My friend sets it down and I notice a cloud of loose fur falling onto the deck. As soon as it&amp;#39;s on the deck this thing darts to the kids and you can already smell it- stinks like doritos mixed with dirty gym socks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time it starts jumping on the kids, darting back and forth from the deck onto the grass, it&amp;#39;s tongue sticking out and gasping for air because it&amp;#39;s a pug and they are just genetic experiments on par with chihuahuas. When it finally calms down the thing squats and decides to take a shit exactly in the spot where the kids are playing. If I didn&amp;#39;t catch it happening they would have stepped in it, because my friend made no effort to clean it up so I went to grab a bag and some paper towels which I handed to them (I imagine their yard is full of turds, something I&amp;#39;ve noticed other dog owners allow when their dog is outside). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food was ready at some point and kids were told to wash their hands because they were touching the pug and letting it lick them. Friend repeats the common myth about &amp;quot;dogs mouths are cleaner than a humans&amp;quot; and I interrupt and tell them no, that&amp;#39;s a myth. I could tell my friend was annoyed by that lol.

I pulled her away from them first which left my Lab in the line of fire. The dogs were aggressive. Nipping at me and my dogs. Thank god Loki (my lab) is trained because I think the other dogs would be dead.

She grabs them and pulls them back and hooks them in their leads. She then yells at me! Why? Because my smaller dog had been barking at her dogs. Now she was just standing next to me.

At this point I just turned and walked away.

The next day, once again walking my dogs. And the same dogs come running out at us. This time the fat lady and her even fatter husband were sitting on the porch. And they laughed. Once again dogs didn’t listen to them.

 **NORTH DIGHTON, Mass. —**

A 14-year-old boy was mauled to death Thursday by several dogs while working to take care of animals that were on the Dighton property.

Ryan Hazel, of Rehoboth, was driven to the home on Maple Swamp Road at 6 p.m. by his grandmother so he could take care of several animals that were on the property.

After more than an hour passed, Ryan’s grandmother became concerned and called the victim’s parents, who were out of state at the time. The parents called a neighbor who went to check on Ryan and found him suffering from traumatic injuries

I am at my wits end. My dog is so sweet while everyone is around and when we leave she’s an absolute terror. I had to leave for work stuff for an hour and a half today. She’s been getting kennelled because she will get into anything and everything while we’re gone. And no matter what we do she still tears stuff up. 

Today she was in her entirely metal kennel (Huge kennel,more than big enough) for an hour and a half and we came home, she like tore her way out of the kennel. Bent the hell out of it (I’m still baffled at how) and then proceeded to get into the trash (there wasn’t much trash because we try to keep it out.

Got into my yarn bag and pulled my yarn out across the floor (it’s kept in a bag under a side table). She was fed and let out and everything this morning before I left.

She doesn’t tear up ANYTHING or get into ANYTHING if we’re home. I’m sure it’s got something to do with separation anxiety but I’m at my wits end. The kennel with a tv on has been our solution but now what? If she can just break out of her kennel. I can’t just padlock the thing shut 😰

5) They are destructive. They chew up belongings, they stink up houses, they dig up yards, their waste poisons the environment.

6) All of the above is not only a nuisance for the dog’s owner, but for everyone else who has to interact with it (whether willingly or not).

7) Improving any of the above requires a great deal of time, work, and/or money that could be better spent on…practically anything else.

So what do they do? THEY GET A FUCKING BEAGLE!!

 Other than the barking, this dog is really ok and doesn't make other obnoxious sounds or smell awful. It also is well trained in other aspects and won't bother you for food or anything. I often get along well with him and pet him when he runs to me, but the barking is enough to drive me insane. I seriously would be in jail because it barks while in the car and I would have thrown it out the window. 

 So they took the dog to my house this weekend since they were visiting from out of state. Even though the dog was never allowed on my mom's furniture, sure enough this week was special. The dog was allowed to use our living room couch, that our dogs are never allowed on, as a bed. Also the dog used the pillows on the couch for it's dick, ass, and drool to be all over. I made sure they were thrown in the wash and also bitched at everyone about it. 

 For my sister's birthday this weekend, we decided to go to a really large and beautiful park with some food. My brother and his fiance just had to take the dog with ""mommy and daddy"" to our family picnic. I told them it's gonna bark the whole time....and I was right. See, we never really have nice things like this as a family and since we live in a trash city, we rarely get to spend a nice day out in such beautiful nature like this - which is about an hour away. As you can tell, this would have been 10X better if only there was some consideration for everyone's peace and sanity. 

  Every single animal - dog, goose, duck, you name it... was barked at like the dog was being murdered in cold blood. It's a beagle, so there is no little ""woof, woof!"", but instead all very obnoxious ""ARRRWOOOooOOwooOOO!!"" while it pulled and struggled to run off it's leash. Everyone and their mother, the ducklings, the geese, crows and deer, possibly even the fish, cleared the area for the stupid alarm dog crying over other animals walking by. I guess it's kinda cool if you are one of those anti-social pricks that thinks dogs are better company than humans. In this case, people were trying to relax and catch fish or were also having a family picnic but soon had to pack their shit up and leave because my brother can't control his fucking dog. There was also nice people that we were happy to socialize with and their faces changed when the dog barked. Other dog owners whose dogs were trained were looking at us like ""wtf?"". We received a lot of nasty looks. Their dogs did not even bark back. One of them, a big dog that could probably kill him, just stopped and tilted it's head and looked at him like ""whoa there"". One lady walked up to us and commented that she heard him from the entire opposite end of the park and that he was way too loud. 

 My sister has a 3 yr old daughter and a 9 month old baby boy.  Even my niece lost her shit and yelled at the dog to shut-up and kept wanting to go somewhere else.  I took my niece away and we took pictures and raced up the hills. My brother and his fiance were really embarrassed, as they should be. My brother lost his shit, cursed and kicked the dog once. It's like they couldn't even sit down and enjoy their food because they had to drop it every time they took a bite to attempt to control the crying shitbeast. During the walk back to the car, my sister's husband was talking out loud about how he could never deal with a dog. They definitely heard him too and just kept quiet. 

  Then when we get to my sister and her husband's house, don't they allow their dog on their couch? I am surprised my sister's husband didn't say anything because usually he tells them not to. My sister never tells anyone anything because she is a push-over.

I stumbled across this sub a few weeks ago and I'm so glad I did. I feel like I'm the only person I know that hasn't jumped on the "" good boy bork bork"" bandwagon.

I don't hate dogs. If I see one on the trails I run, I'll ask to pet it. When my neighbors dog gets loose I'll tie her up in my carport and give her water til they can get her. That being said I have zero desire to have a dog. I had one when I was growing up and when she died that was just it for me. 

The reason I won't chug a lug lug on the dog nutter train is because of my mother and her dog ""rescue"".

She was and is an awful person with whatever cluster b mental disorder shes afflicted with. She has destroyed every house she has lived in with all her rescues. At one point she had upwards of 25+ dogs, mostly pits and mostly inside the house. The rest were in a labrynth of kennels in the back, side and front yard. They were not taken care of. You could smell her house before you ever saw it. 

Of course, the guy she had been living with finally had enough and left. He was the one paying the bills and when he stopped the house got foreclosed on. 

So me and all of you would think this was a huge Vegas blinking neon sign that something has got to change. But it didn't. Of course not. Because mental illness and dog nutters are one and the same. 

What ended up happening bc she refused to give up the dogs (and cats, there were a fuck ton of cats inside and out) was she got her ""friends"" from the ""rescue"" groups to help her move to the place she was moving to. 
And all hell broke loose. They saw the condition of the house, the animals, the cages and went apeshit calling her a hoarder, threatening to get the authorities involved and just running a smear campaign against her ( she called it a smear campaign, I say the truth hurts). They took about 15 dogs and fuck knows how many cats. 

After all that, do you think she got a little sense knocked into her head and realized there was a problem?

Nope. She got moved Into the place she's at now with whatever dogs were left and immediately began adopting more dogs. The house is filthy and nasty, the dogs do nothing but bark and destroy the house. She grifts money online for dog food because she won't actually pay for dog food herself. She uses her EBT to buy them hot dogs when the grifts don't come thru. She won't get them rabies shot bc she's anti vax (yes! Even animals can get autism! /s).

There's a lot more, but I don't want to really dwell on it that much. Im disgusted by how she lives. She looks and smells like ass and dog bc they took over the house. Her life revolves around taking the dogs out. Feeding the dogs. Laying at the alter of dog worship and lighting candles for the great DOG GOD. It's the most absurdly sad thing I've ever witnessed.

That's all I got for now. I'm so glad there are others like me that can't deal with this toxic dog worship culture.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

The boy was attacked by the border collie while his family ate lunch at the Carlei Green Vineyards in Beaconsfield Upper, resulting in him needing plastic surgery to repair a tear duct.

His mum said he was upset when “he looks in the mirror and says ‘bad doggy, bad doggy’” and “I have a scar, and don’t look beautiful”.

The injury has affected the family so much, they refuse to put photos of him on Facebook for fear of upsetting relatives and friends.

The owner of the winery, Sergio Carlei, this week pleaded guilty at Dandenong Magistrates’ Court to a charge of owning a dog that attacked or bit a person causing serious injury.

The boy’s family was enjoying lunch in the outside area of the winery’s pizzeria at around 4.45pm on March 10 this year when the owner’s black and white border collie named Diesel came wandering.

As the child approached the dog, it turned and bit him on the face, causing severe damage to his eye.

The boy was taken to hospital where he underwent plastic surgery to a cut under his lower right eyelid, which required a stent in damaged tear ducts, and a puncture wound to his right upper eyelid.

Diesel was taken to the pound, where he has stayed. A decision about his future has yet to be made.

The mother’s harrowing victim impact statement was read out in court.

She said her son had to have an artificial tear duct inserted into his face and full recovery would take many months.

She said he was now scared, upset and angry, and they missed his previous bubbly personality.

She said other kids told him “he looks scary” and even now couldn’t talk about the incident because it made her cry.

Carlei, a chiropractor, said he was extremely sorry for what had happened and had put in place measures to make sure it never happened again.
He said he had watched CCTV of the attack, which had now been taped over, and saw Diesel “protecting its food source” and the bite happened simultaneously as the child “embraced” the dog.

The court heard he had pleaded guilty to a previous local law charge of allowing a dog (not Diesel) to rush at a person, incurring a $500 fine, just a few weeks before this attack.

Magistrate Julie O’Donnell said his responsibility to ensure the safety of the public on his commercial property was very high, and he had failed.

Carlei was fined $5000 and has to pay council costs of $2547. The maximum penalty that could have been imposed was a fine of around $6400.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A three-year-old bitten on the eye by a dog at a winery has been left so scarred he cries when he looks at himself in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

My first post here and a throwaway account. I need to rant because I’m going insane. 

I’ll try to sum it up so I don’t ramble on forever. First off, I don’t necessarily HATE dogs. I like certain breeds if they’re well trained. But I’m definitely a cat person, always have been. 

I’ve been dating my bf for awhile now and he has a dog (some sort of mixed breed idk for sure what she is). I’m 13 weeks pregnant, and ever since I’ve gotten pregnant, I can’t stand this fucking dog. She’s not even really a bad dog and is pretty well behaved. She just annoys the everloving shit out of me. 

His mom lives in the same apartment complex and she has the dog a lot (I guess she’s both my bf and his moms, not just my bf’s dog). This dog is fucking obsessed with her and can’t go a day without her. I mean this stupid mutt wakes up at 7am every day and whines at the door until she comes to get her for the day. I have a hard time sleeping as it is because I’m sick and have back/hip pain, so being woken up by this stupid mutt drives me up a wall. 

Her bark is another thing. She’s pretty good with not barking too much, but holy fuck when she does, it’s OBNOXIOUS. If anyone comes to the door she barks like mad. Sometimes she’ll do an even more annoying little “ruff” when she hears something. 

Even just the sound of her claws on the hardwood makes me mad. The carpet is stained from when she was a puppy and wasn’t potty trained yet, so we have to deep clean those and I’m sure the stains won’t come out. 

Honestly I feel guilty saying it but I hate this dog. I wish I would never see her again. I feel like such an asshole for saying it because my bf and his mom love her so much, and I used to, but I just can’t take her anymore. I hate coming home and having to deal with her. I hate looking at her. My blood boils when she’s around. I don’t want to raise a baby with her around. Thankfully his mom has agreed to have the dog for awhile once the baby is born. I just want her to go away. We also have a cat and I think I would go insane without her! We cuddle every night and I can tell that she’s not a big fan of the dog either haha. 

Thanks for letting me rant.

I always hear that dog people are delusional, and this time was no exception. After realizing she just stepped in dog poop, the professor said “Oh it’s ok! I still love her!” With the biggest smile on her face. Absolutely not the reaction I would have if I just stepped in a pile of shit.

Today, May 17th 2019, me and some friend were riding around the neighborhood. They had bikes while I had a scooter. One of them said that they saw a dog and we went to go check. Yup. There was a dog. It looked to be a pitbull-lab mix. There was only a tiny fence separating the dog from the road. You couldn't really call it a fence, it was only some chicken wire that was around a foot high. We didn't think too much of the dog, so we ended up riding away. Next thing we knew, we heard barking.

We began to go as fast as we can. They ended up leaving me behind since I was too slow. The dog was on my heels the entire time. I swear, I have never ridden a scooter that fast before. I managed to get back over to where we lived, all in one piece. My dad approached the mutt and scared it away.

We never got to see the owners, but they probably would have blamed us for making their ""precious doggo"" mad. I hope we won't have to see that dog ever again.

They all know we're not dog fans but we don't protest too loudly...if we did, we'd have no friends :( So after dinner we all head into the living room and start chatting. In comes Doggo dropping the tennis ball in one of my friend's lap and she throws the ball and gets the toys out...So for the next hour we had to listen to dog stories and play with the dogs. The best story of the night was one of our friends telling us the story about how her lab ate a tampon and they spent $5k on surgery to have it removed from his intestine. I'd have put that dog down so fast! $6k!!! Are you kidding?!! UGH!! Finally, I got up and gave the 'well, it's getting late...' and my husband and I left. When does this dog craze end.

So during dinner of course both dogs rummaging around under the table stepping on our feet, licking our legs and putting their snouts up on our legs begging for food. Sadly all 3 couples are dog lovers. My husband and I are not. They all know we&amp;#39;re not dog fans but we don&amp;#39;t protest too loudly...if we did, we&amp;#39;d have no friends :( So after dinner we all head into the living room and start chatting. In comes Doggo dropping the tennis ball in one of my friend&amp;#39;s lap and she throws the ball and gets the toys out...So for the next hour we had to listen to dog stories and play with the dogs. The best story of the night was one of our friends telling us the story about how her lab ate a tampon and they spent $5k on surgery to have it removed from his intestine. I&amp;#39;d have put that dog down so fast! $6k!!! Are you kidding?!! UGH!! Finally, I got up and gave the &amp;#39;well, it&amp;#39;s getting late...&amp;#39; and my husband and I left. When does this dog craze end. I can count on one hand people/friends I know that either do not like dogs or are apathetic to them. Everyone else...dog lover/fanatic. So discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

As selfish as it seems to sound to dog lovers, I enjoy sleeping in on free days or lounging around the house without worrying about having to feed, bathe, walk or otherwise entertain a dog. They can be cute in social settings, but I personally didn't want one.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have anxiety and while it seems like dogs/pets can have a calming effect on some, dogs send my anxiety into overdrive. I'm constantly aware of them and I'm never able to feel ""alone"" while they're around. I feel most at peace and in control with my anxiety either alone or with a very close family member or my SO, so there's that. I've expressed this to my SO but if you're familiar with dog people, you know they'll do their best to convince you that you haven't met the dog for you, you just need time and you'll love them, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, My SO and I went to an animal shelter yesterday just to ""look"" (here's a tip to anyone neutral on dogs but don't want to be dog owners — ""looking"" at an animal shelter is a trap with a dog lover. Guaranteed you'll walk out of there with a dog by the end of the visit). Now I may not be a dog person but I am a fan of other, smaller pets — think turtles, birds, maybe hamsters. I'd like to tell you I'm the owner of a cute little turtle or something, but if I was I wouldn't be here. Nope, we got a dog. Like a fool, I was hoping my SO's sentiments of 'warming up' to the dog would ring true, but it didn't. All it did was reinforce that I definitely don't want to be a dog owner.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 48 hours since we adopted it. In that 48 hours, I have:

* Lost precious sleep, both last night and the previous night.
* Felt trapped. I can't so much get up to get some water without having it pop its head up to track what I'm doing.
* Had my germophobe tendencies pushed to the limit. So much hair...
* Felt massive resentment, guilt and remorse at having gone against my gut (and tossing money to the wind via adoption fees, pet stuff, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I told my SO that this isn't going to work, regardless of the dog. He knows about my anxiety and after years of struggling, I've done well keeping it under control for the past two months or so. But this dog situation has compromised that. He's understanding and tomorrow morning, he'll be taking it back. I'm super excited about making up for lost sleep this weekend. Unfortunately I'm on dog sitting duty until then.

No matter how I twisted my question in Google I got very vague answers, most of the links were focused on how to make your dog friendly office work and other stupid stuff. There was even some infuriating links on how to sneak your dog into work, as if they need any other excuses.

I was trying to find two areas of dogs in the workplace, not only people having them in the office and having to put up with them,  also people like servers and store staff who seem to be required to clean up dog shit these days.

The government website I looked at had a lot of vague health and safety rules, but nothing specifically targeting dogs or dog waste. There was a little bit about safety should you work at a kennel or a veterinarian's office but those are dog specific jobs where no one should be surprised at having to deal with this stuff. There doesn't seem to be any legal protection for servers, flight attendants or store staff who are now expected to also be kennel attendants. IMHO these people did not sign up to deal with dog waste and should not be required to do so.

It seems the laws need to catch up to nutter culture and provide protection to people in the public service sectors, not to mention people with allergies who have a job they like and should not be forced to go on the job hunt because of dogs in their office.

I'm thinking we need to put pressure on our elected officials to address this problem. I really feel for people like the student putting themselves through school with a serving job and feeling like they have to clean up dog s*** or lose their job. Servers already get to clean up after the drunks that threw up in the bathroom, they really don't need any more disgusting jobs.

There was even some infuriating links on how to sneak your dog into work, as if they need any other excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find two areas of dogs in the workplace, not only people having them in the office and having to put up with them,  also people like servers and store staff who seem to be required to clean up dog shit these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government website I looked at had a lot of vague health and safety rules, but nothing specifically targeting dogs or dog waste. There was a little bit about safety should you work at a kennel or a veterinarian&amp;#39;s office but those are dog specific jobs where no one should be surprised at having to deal with this stuff. There doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any legal protection for servers, flight attendants or store staff who are now expected to also be kennel attendants. IMHO these people did not sign up to deal with dog waste and should not be required to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the laws need to catch up to nutter culture and provide protection to people in the public service sectors, not to mention people with allergies who have a job they like and should not be forced to go on the job hunt because of dogs in their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking we need to put pressure on our elected officials to address this problem. I really feel for people like the student putting themselves through school with a serving job and feeling like they have to clean up dog s*** or lose their job. Servers already get to clean up after the drunks that threw up in the bathroom, they really don&amp;#39;t need any more disgusting jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR we should pressure our officials for laws to protect people from dealing with dogs in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

After that the dog hates her, growls at her and dropped the dudes homework in the toilet with jealousy.

&gt;  
&gt;When drifts of fluffy snow bury [New England](https://www.boston.com/tags/new-england-travel), it’s time to plan a winter escape — and there’s no need to leave canine companions behind. Vermont’s Green Mountains are a snowy wonderland of rolling peaks, full of cozy inns and trails that are as fun for pets as humans.  
&gt;  
&gt;For some, the first stop is the [Paw House Inn](https://www.pawhouseinn.com/), a Rutland, [Vermont](https://www.boston.com/tags/vermont-travel), bed and breakfast that’s designed for doggy whims. Guests dine on “woofles” in the dog-friendly dining room or stay warm with their pets in the dog-friendly beds, which are equipped with staircases for easy entry. Rooms at the Paw House Inn are available from $155, with a $10 surcharge if you *don’t* bring a dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another favorite for dog owners is the [Kimpton Taconic](http://www.taconichotel.com/) hotel in Manchester, Vermont, where canine guests are greeted with locally-made, organic dog treats from [Wagatha’s](https://www.wagathas.com/), a bakery that whips up dog biscuits in seasonal flavor. Rooms, which start at $169 with no pet fee, come furnished with comfy pet beds and bowls, and concierge services include pet walking and pet sitting.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But should you bring your dog along for the day, the mountains are full of canine-friendly activities.  
&gt;  
&gt;“For winter, there’s just so many places to go,” said Paw House Inn co-owner Mitch Frankenberg. “Our guests take their dogs on snowshoeing trails, hiking trails, fat biking trails, and to some of the cross-country ski areas that allow dogs.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fat bikers and cross-country skiers put pets through their paces on 26 kilometers of trails at [Mountain Meadows XC Ski &amp; Snowshoe Center](https://xcskiing.net/). Trail passes start at $19, with rental skis and bikes available onsite.  
&gt;  
&gt;For an ice skate that’s worthy of a side trip, head to [Lake Morey Resort](http://lakemoreyresort.com/activities/winter-activities/) in Fairlee, which has the longest maintained ice skating trail in the U.S., with rental skates available from $10. While people gear up with a pair of skates, dogs come ready-made to hit the ice, skittering across the frozen surface alongside their humans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not all dogs are content to simply go along for the ride. There’s a thriving [skijoring](http://www.skijorusa.org/aboutskijoring/tabid/954/default.aspx)community in Vermont, with skiers who kick and glide in tandem with their dogs, linked to the animals with a sturdy harness. Participants can bring their own skijoring equipment to Mountain Meadows, then take off across the trail system using the combined speed of skier and dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even would-be dog owners have the chance to experience a snowy canine adventure by dogsledding through Vermont’s rolling forest trails. Deep in the state’s Northeast Kingdom, award-winning dogsled racer Jim Blair runs [Eden Dogsledding](http://www.edendogsledding.com/), using “free range,” never-chained Alaskan huskies for tours of a custom-built trail system. Private dogsledding tours start at $495 for two to four people. In the more southerly mountains of central Vermont, [Peace Pups Dogsledding](https://www.peacepupsdogsledding.com/about-ken) explores the forest near Lake Elmore with a team of Siberian huskies, and even offers dogsledding lessons for would-be mushers. Peace Pups dogsledding outings start at $300 per sled, which accommodate up to three passengers, with mushing lessons from $550 per person.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whichever activity you choose, Frankenberg insists that bringing your dog on vacation is a win for both of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;“And when you go back home,” he said, “your dog should be more tired than you.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just randomly found &lt;a href=""https://www.boston.com/travel/travel/2018/01/25/you-can-treat-your-dog-to-a-snowy-vacation-in-vermont?s_campaign=bcom%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, while looking for something entirely different....

Once out of curiosity I clicked on a link to a fund-raising site posted as comment on fb on totally unrelated post, about make up or sth. And I found out, that it's fund raising for a sick dog. 11 year old dog that has mouth cancer. And dog's owners have raised rougly 4000 $ already, and are aiming for 4700 for now. (Also, I'm not sure how much this is for people in US, but in my country, Poland, it's like 4 months of average work paychecks, or year worth of renting a small apartment in one of the bigger cities). I mean, people spend money on a stupider things, so fine, but asking strangers for money? Well, anyone can do with their money as their please, but isn't it weird, donating to a cause like that? A dog is quite old as it is, and there's no guarantee it'll recover, and even then it will probably live like a year or two longer. Even if someone loves dogs or animals, there are dogs dying from much easier to treat diseases, there are overcrowded shelter with dogs living in awful conditions. Imagine how many dogs could be helped for the amount of money that is spent on one and maybe won't even work. Dogs don't think like people, it's not like the old person who wants to be there for their friends and family, has plans for future, things to achieve, passions. 

Like, wouldn't it be more reasonable to have a dog on painkillers or sth as long as it's working and it can live comfortably and then let it go... And spend all that cash on sth else. I'm not even touching things like donating to hospitals, research, saving wildlife or whatever. Fine, you love dogs, but still so many dogs could be helped for that amount of money. It's a free world, and anyone can donate whatever they won't, but I just don't undrstand.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she continues to leave the dog here. Nobody asks if I’m ok with it. Just assumes that everybody loves dogs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

I finally typed in ""I hate my dog"" on google and was so blessed to find this community.   


  
When I met my boyfriend I knew he had a dog. He was a very laid back dog. Did his own thing, lounged around, didn't make messes. He was ideal. I'm not 100% a dog hater, but I'm busy and I don't exactly have time for one. I already have a toddler, so the idea of picking up after a dog as well seemed like too much. Fast forward a few years, and we deciede to move in together. The dog comes. I've grown to like him. He doesn't bark, doesn't climb on furniture, is good with my son and is 100% potty trained. Everything is running smoothly.   


  
THEN, my boyfriend decides to surprise me with a ""family"" dog. A puppy that can grow up with my son and that we can raise together. \*insert eyeroll\* I HATE THIS DOG. I've hated her since day one. She's a pitbull, she is constantly chewing on shit, she whines when she's alone for more than 5 minutes. She greets you by jumping on you. She gets into the trash. She is everything you can hate about a dog rolled into one. We've had her for almost 2 years now. She still isn't fully potty trained. If you let her outside, she can come right back in and piss on the floor 15 minutes later. She's the dumbest dog I've ever met. I've constantly dropped hints about rehoming her and he acts devastated about it. I've completely stopped interacting with her, so all the responsibility is on him and he doesn't seem to mind the constant messes and shit we have to deal with from her. He refused to get her fixed, and we just found out this piece of shit is pregnant. Evidently he let her outside one day while she was in heat and nature took it's course (our backyard is fenced but occasionally strays dig under or find a way in). I refuse to deal with puppies. I refuse. I told him to rehome her or he and her can go stay at his moms house or a friends house until she has those damn heathens and he gets rid of all of them.    


  


He says I'm playing favorites because I don't mind his older dog (of course not, he doesn't make my life living hell) and that she will be heartbroken if we rehome her. This dog is an idiot. She will get over it. Then he says something bad will happen to her and her puppies because of her breed, well I didn't pick her breed and I'm sure we can find a nice sancturary for her to go to. There a plenty of pitbull rescuses all over. She's not aggresive or violent, she's just a complete pain in the ass 24/7 and apparently that's not a good enough reason to put her out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying, I felt so guilty for hating this dog.

I've explained to people that I'd like to use my life savings to buy a plot of land in the country and create a home for myself as well as multiple cats. I'd ideally like to take in cats that have been abused or neglected or are about to be killed in a shelter and give them a non-shelter environment to be socialized and then adopted out in. I want to do this partially to help save cats, but also because I feel like I could help people to take better care of their cats. I'm even interested in becoming certified as a cat behaviorist and offering advice for anyone struggling with their cats behavior.

Sounds pretty professional right? Sounds like I have deep passion for helping cats and people who own them and care a lot for this animal. So WHY after clearly stating that I want to do this for cats am I constantly being bombarded with stupid questions? The ones that irk me the most are these two:

""Why dont you open an all animals sanctuary?""

and

""Oh BUT you should take in dogs too, why dont you take in dogs,, you're in the country theres lots of room,,, make a dog sanctuary""

I'm not even gonna touch the all animals sanctuary question bc I dont have 10 million dollars, nor am I prepared to study zoology or whatever you would need to to open that.

 But the dog nutters are AWFUL to me about this. They constantly try to ""persuade"" me to also make facilities for dogs. And get offended or brush me off when I say that I dont have a passion for dogs, only cats. Like it's my life and I dont want to take in dogs!! I dont even want a personal pet dog!!!

First off dogs are extremely expensive especially when you're taking care of many of them and I really dont have the money for that many dogs. But like the thing that gets me the most is,, I've never really owned a dog? I dont know anything about their body language/care/socialization. I literally do not know how to take care of a dog and yet people are up my ass about ""needing to take the wittle puppers in too"". I clearly am not the person to open a dog sanctuary!! I know about CATS. Why would I open a sanctuary on a pet I know nothing about??? 

Not to mention that having dogs in my CAT sanctuary would literally destroy what I'm trying to create!! I want to take in ""problem"" cats and socialize them properly and you want a dog running around a bunch of scared/aggressive cats?? Many of those cats will not even be able to be adopted out to a home if it has a dog/kids in it because it's not suitable for the cat! It may become aggressive or scared because of the dog and some cats even have past traumas concerning dogs?? Not all animals are compatible?? Just because YOU like dogs doesnt mean I'm suddenly going to drop my entire life goal for them. There are plenty of people out there who know lots about dogs and want to help them, go talk to them about it.

Sorry for that being so long, I'm just so sick of telling people about my passion only to be belittled because I didnt want to take in dogs. And because of Dog Worship Culture I know this is going to be a problem when I actually do open the sanctuary.

Backstory: My mom took in this chihuahua as a stray a few years ago. I told her it was a bad idea, tried to talk her out of it, but she felt too bad for the dog. Fast forward a few years later, and my mom and I get a house together. I beg her to not bring the dog because he is going to ruin the brand new carpet in the house. She promises he won’t. Lo and behold, the brand new carpet is absolutely fucking ruined and disgusting one year later from the dog using the bathroom in the house. In retrospect, I guess he’s a pretty good dog. He doesn’t chew anything up or bite, but he does use the house as his personal toilet despite being let outside and having puppy pads in the house. 

My mom also can’t afford to take him to a vet so he has a lot of problems, including glands, so he leaves a shit stain wherever he sits. Not to mention worms and fleas. He acts like he is starving all the time even though he eats like a king. 

I just seriously hate this dog. My mom doesn’t want him either but will not surrender him to a shelter because iT’s CrUeL. And absolutely nofuckingbody will take him. I’ve offered money to people to take him. I have a feeling we will be stuck with him until he dies which is probably a ways off. We expected him to die a long time ago, and he’s still going strong. I seriously can’t fucking deal with it much longer. He’s probably more miserable here than he would be at a shelter because no one likes him, but my mom is irresponsible as fuck and won’t do the right thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel really bad for hating an animal.

&lt;p&gt;I just seriously hate this dog. My mom doesn’t want him either but will not surrender him to a shelter because iT’s CrUeL. And absolutely nofuckingbody will take him. I’ve offered money to people to take him. I have a feeling we will be stuck with him until he dies which is probably a ways off. We expected him to die a long time ago, and he’s still going strong. I seriously can’t fucking deal with it much longer. He’s probably more miserable here than he would be at a shelter because no one likes him, but my mom is irresponsible as fuck and won’t do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

This is all very bizarre behavior to me. And they all act like I&amp;#39;m some kind of weirdo &amp;#39;cause I don&amp;#39;t want to worship these dogs and the ground they walk on. It&amp;#39;s very frustrating. This is my first post here and I&amp;#39;m glad there&amp;#39;s a community of people who I share similar viewpoints with.&lt;/p&gt;

The city has finally gotten ownership of this land and planned to use it as a part of their trails system and designate the surrounding area as a wildlife corridor. They are ok with dogs being walked here on leash, but no more off-leash dogs- as that is a huge liability to the city.

She eats my food, my kitten's food, this bitch harasses my older family cat, Patrick and shes just annoying in general. So about 3 days ago, I was in the living room watching tv while watching the kittens play when Leo goes into the kitchen. I dont really think much of it until I hear alot of loud jingles of the dumbass's collar, so i rush into the kitchen to find Leo underneath the thing while she chews on half his face like a chew toy. I immediately yell ""What the fuck are you doing?"" And stomp over there, I then grab her and rip her away from him and swoop him up in my arms. I hurredly rush him into my and the kitten's room and check his face to see if hes okay. Thankfully he was and he was just shooken up a bit. The sad thing is this happens about once a day and everytime i mention it to my mom and sister who supposedly care about my kitten's wellbeing, they pull the ""shes just playing"" excuse, which gets me all fired up. You, a person who supposedly loves animals and think you know them best, call THAT PLAYING? When I mention this to my dad, he's basically the only reasonable one! This is why I hate dogs.

I used to post here a lot but I got paranoid someone from my fiancé’s family would find my reddit account or something. But I want to kind of get this all off my chest and I’ve been waiting for a while. Anyway. 

My fiancé has two large dogs and I have two cats.  The dogs are the perfect example of everything we hate about dogs. The worst is definitely the smell, but they also have ZERO discipline, bark frequently at nothing, destroy everything they can get their teeth on and have “nipped” at guests. I tried to train them... like REALLY put in a solid effort for a year, and the progress was so minimal and slow I essentially gave up. 

Previously we lived in a smaller house and the dogs and cats were constantly fighting. For the most part we kept them separate but the house was too small (NOT a small house, mind you. Just too small for two large disgusting dogs). 

We just moved into a much larger home on a larger piece of land. Now the dogs have an entire room to themselves (and a lot of land to run around) that’s basically empty. There’s a couch in that room that they have torn to shreds and I put old pillows and blankets in there that I don’t care about as “decoy” stuff for them to destroy so they don’t start eating the walls. They have eaten countless things in there, I won’t even list them. 

Their room smells AWFUL. It is SO BAD AND SO GROSS. It doesn’t smell like pee or poop because for the most part 😐 they go outside. It just smells like nasty dog. Fortunately thank God, I have my own separate living room where my nice furniture and pillows are. It is a literal sanctuary. So out of our entire 2,600 sq ft house, the dogs have a large room and an acre to run around. 

I’m actually happy. I love my fiancé and I know he loves his dogs. And I love my cats and now they have nearly the entire house to enjoy, with me, without dogs around. 

Over the past few years, we have been around other people’s dogs and he has been able to see how different it is when you have dogs that behave. I still hate dogs and I always will. But I just hope these ones... don’t live that much longer... so next time when we get a dog, maybe we could get something more conducive to a family life. I think having “bad” dogs has made me more amenable to having a good dog some day... even though I still hate dogs. For example we have friends that have a small daughter (about 3). While I was not around, his dog nipped at her. A week later, we were at a friends house and she was chasing their dog, cuddling and rolling around with the dog and having fun. I know my fiancé is very excited to have children someday and I gave him ALLLLL the looks about that. 

Because of his job, I’m often left home alone for days at a time. I won’t lie, i feel safer with the dogs because they bark incessantly if anyone or anything comes near the house. Trust me, it’s not worth the nightmare that they are. But I just try to stay positive and look for the silver lining. 

The current issue is that he wants to go on vacation, but there’s literally no one who will watch the dogs and it’s unbelievable how expensive it is to board them. That would basically double the price of the vacation. It’s sad that the dogs are so bad, even friends and family have outright said they won’t take care of them. For me, it’s a constant eye roll. 

All in all, my life has improved astronomically since we moved to the larger house. The dogs used to be a crippling issue in my life. I used to think it would be the end of our relationship eventually. It was constantly a source of argument and resentment. As of now, they’re mostly an inconvenience. And at this point, considering what we have gone through with the dogs (which is A LOT that I didn’t mention here), I’m sure we will NOT be getting large dogs ever again.

Quick back story......
MIL is a dog nutter who refuses to tell her daughters to keep their dogs separated from my children after they are known to be aggressive because ""the dogs are just as much their babies as your kids are yours, I can't tell them how to parent""

SIL1: began separating or leaving her dog at home (like a semi normal human) after we discussed the kids need for safety.

SIL2: Refuses to leave her dog at home and when there is a family event, refuses to keep her separate because it ""causes the dog distress""
She is aware that if the dog isn't separated from the children that we are either not coming, or once we get there and realize she's not putting her animal up, we are leaving.


So a couple weeks ago around Father's Day my husband got in a semi unrelated tiff with his family and decided he was done trying to connect with that side of the family.  I stayed out of this argument because I am constantly blamed for the breakdown of relationship between MIL &amp; hubs.

I continued to try and plan around them and male connections though, encouraging my husband to give them another chance. One of the topics that my husband went on about was that they are constantly putting him &amp; the kids last, and overall don't act like this part of the family matters. They said that I don't plan well enough for them to make it to anything. Even though I was already trying, I tried harder. 

Instead of just giving them plenty of notice I asked them all to agree on a date for my baby shower and our house warming party. 1 event per month and ended up changing the baby shower date for them and set the housewarming date WITH them. 

Later I was asked about whether or not we would make it to SIL2's birthday in 3 DAYS. 

My husband works until 8 pm, but I wanted my 2 boys to see that side of the family so I was going to make it work. That is - until we were disinvited for the dog over the family chat. Even though they haven't seen the kids in months. 

SIL2 wrote: ""I'll be leaving the shindig Friday around 9/9:30. So it probably won't be worth it for you guys to drive down on that day. Plus my dog will be there and since its my birthday, I'm not locking her away from me, because she's a party guest too.""

I wrote: ""We definitely won't be there. Bringing my children around a  party guest who likes to bite my kids would make me irresponsible""

To which my SIL1's husband ""❤️"" reacted SIL2's disinvitation and then ""😆"" reacted my reply. 

It was the straw that broke my back. After years of trying to compromise I was done. I told them all to fuck off and not expect us at any family events, all attacks have been at MIL's home. MIL ended up messaging me personally to call me a bitch and say I was tearing the family apart. 

I called her insane and blocked her. 

I am relieved to be done but so damn sad for my children. I know what it's like to grow up without a cohesive extended family, and that's what they'll end up with thanks to their inability  to put the children's safety first. 

TL;DR: SIL's dog is known to be aggressive and has previously attacked my children. SIL won't put her away. After years of trying to find ways around it while keeping my kids safe, I am finally done.

It is the best relationship I have ever had, by far. She prefers dogs, I like cats more. But her dog was put to sleep before I moved in, and neither she nor I really want any pets any time soon, so it should all be good. 

Unfortunately the entire fucking neighborhood disagrees, and has decided that their dogs should be a constant presence in our lives and home. We are surrounded by screaming, barking dogs, including a disgusting pit bull next door who squeals and barks at everything, and who lunges at us if we walk too near the fence (on our own property mind you). It wasn’t always so bad – until this spring, it was only the pit next door who was a real source of distress, but several new dogs have moved into the neighborhood this year, and they are all horrible. They don’t even really bark or yap, awful as that is, they sound like they are being strangled or beaten. You can’t walk down the sidewalk without getting barked at or lunged at, or chased by some dog who’s gotten loose. They're everywhere, and inescapable.

We’ve talked to our neighbors (the ones who aren’t obviously insane); we’ve called the police, we’ve called the health department about the mountain of dog feces next to our fence that we can smell when we walk outside. We’ve written the mayor and the council president. Of course no one will do anything about any of this, because IT’Z DOGGZ.

We can’t sit on the front porch and enjoy a drink and an evening breeze; we can’t sit on the back deck and enjoy a meal because of the stench of feces and the leering pit bull ten fucking feet away. Sometimes we can’t have sex because whichever piece of shit three houses up will start screaming like it is being murdered and won’t fucking stop for twenty minutes. We can’t enjoy a nice walk around the neighborhood without getting hassled and barked at every twenty feet. We can’t even be in our front yard without getting barked at by dogs walking past OUR fucking house. It’s utter insanity, but everyone else has apparently decided this is normal and good. I've never felt so alienated in my life.

I try to tune it all out, try to relax, tell myself that whichever dog is shrieking it will stop eventually, that the dog across the street that is barking at 4am will go back inside so I can get back to sleep. But sometimes it just doesn’t stop and no matter how patient I am, how much I put up with, it is never enough, and I become enraged and start yelling at the universe to shut the fuck up. Many days I dread coming home from work, because obviously I want to relax and unwind after a long day, and I know that is unlikely. And it only gets worse, not better. I look forward to rainy days and thunderstorms in the evenings so the fucking dogs won’t be out. I can’t wait for winter. Etc, etc.

And the problem is, SO usually doesn’t think it’s all so bad as that, so we inevitably get into fights. She is (understandably) upset that I am so upset. So we fight about whether to call the police, whether to confront the neighbors (again), whether we should try to sell the house and move, what is our plan to deal with any of this…and every time I end up having to explain to her for the fiftieth fucking time what exactly is so infuriating about this, as if there is some big fucking mystery to unravel. She wonders whether it’s really ‘something else’ bothering me, as if it could not possibly be the fact that there is literally nowhere I can go to escape the neighbors’ horrible fucking animals. I think and worry and stress out about this all the fucking time, and she thinks I’m probably just upset about whatever is going on at my job (which I should be doing right now instead of writing this). 

A couple of months ago I came home after a long day, and within two minutes three dogs from three directions were howling and screeching at one another and would not fucking stop. I tried to keep my cool, I put my hands up and told my SO “I’m just going to go for a walk to cool off, I’ll be back in 20 minutes.” Within two blocks, some dumb broad’s year-old pit bull burst out of her front door and immediately came after me and chased me for a fucking block. I came home thoroughly disgusted, unnerved, and infuriated, and within 5 minutes SO and I having the same fucking fight about what to do about this (as if there is anything to do), and of course whether there was ‘something else’ bothering me. It’s like living in a waking nightmare sometimes. (And I never used to feel this way about dogs, not nearly so intense at least. There are a few I really like. But now I react with disgust almost every time I see one.)

I think my SO really does care – I know she does – and wants things to be better for me, even though she can’t quite understand why I get so angry about this. She grew up with dogs, and she has lived in this neighborhood a long time and has either has simply gotten used to it, or maybe didn’t notice the place deteriorating over the years. We both try to avoid getting into fights about this, and I know it is in part my responsibility (the fights, not the dogs) – we practically never fight otherwise - but almost invariably fail because in that moment it’s like we’re from two different planets. I worry that she isn’t really or fully on my side, that she thinks I am the problem even though she swears that’s not what she thinks; and I want to believe her but then I find myself having to justify my feelings and my anger AGAIN. It’s so stupid, but it feels like there is nothing we can do, because our neighbors and their shit dogs are completely in control.

tl;dr – SO and I don’t have any pets, but we still fight often about the neighborhood dogs. Because dogs ruin everything.

But what really pushed me into the dogfree camp is living in a dog-friendly apartment building.

I didn't want to live in a dog-friendly apartment building but due to circumstances out of my control, I had no choice. My MIL had to live with us temporarily while recovering from an illness and she has a pet bird, and this was the only apartment we could find that accepted pets. However I assumed that it would only be small to medium sized dogs and they would be well behaved. Most of the dogs are small to medium sized, and most of the dogs are well-behaved. But some people clearly have no idea what they are doing.

Can someone explain why someone would have an entire Labrador, Weimaraner, Husky, or Golden Retriever in a small, 650 to 950 square foot apartment (depending on number of bedrooms) with no outdoor space? Or think it is perfectly ok to take these same large dogs through narrow hallways and stairways with blind corners, and expect them to not freak out if a stranger unexpectedly walks around one of those blind corners? Or even worse, why the hell would someone bring a known reactive dog into an apartment situation where they could encounter a stranger in an enclosed space with little opportunity for the stranger to escape? I have been almost attacked by two medium to large dogs in the building under these circumstances (by that I mean that the owner's grip on the leash was the only thing between me and a dog bite). I didn't do anything to provoke it and was just minding my own business. In both cases the owner acted like I was the problem. It's not just me either -- I hear these particular dogs barking angrily at other dogs in the hallways on a regular basis. I have told the management this situation is a mauling waiting to happen and they don't care.

Even worse, I'm pretty sure there's a pitbull in this building, or at least something that looks like one. The management told me that pitbulls and other ""bully breeds"" are not allowed under any circumstances, but this thing looks like it is one so I assume the owners lied and said it was a ""lab mix"" or something.

Now every time I go to or from my building I have to listen intently first to hear if any dogs are coming. If I hear anything that sounds like jingling or paws walking, I wait to see what it is. If a dog is coming, I have to go wait in my apartment, the basement, or around the back of the building until they go by. We haven't moved out because it would cost $4K to get out of the lease early so we're stuck here until next April.

As an addendum, my MIL's pet conure is pretty vicious. I've always said the dog owners would be furious if we released her bird into the hallway and it screamed and dive-bombed them, and it only weighs five ounces.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had a healthy caution of dogs (and I don&amp;#39;t think there is anything wrong with that -- they are descended from apex predators!).

While we could afford the place only because of the damage the dogs did, the estimated house price decreased at least 40% when we were looking to buy.

The dogs somehow broke the beveled glass panel in the beautiful old front door. We had to replace all the floor and trim, replace the whole kitchen, strip all frames, doors and closets to the bare wood, repair and repaint; all the walls were repaired, primed and repainted and we are fixing to repair and repaint the outdoor walls as well.

Because I had been brainwashed into thinking that dogs were the purest of all creatures, far better and more innocent than humans. I always liked cats better, and have 2 as well, but I still thought dogs were the better animal for some reason. 

Growing up, my dad had several dogs. They never bothered me, they didn't really smell (surprisingly) except the last dog, a French bulldog, that was always farting 🤢, but even he was very likable. My dad's place was always quite neat and he walked the dogs 3x a day, so no poos in the garden. 

This all started to change 3 years ago when I met my partner's mum's dogs.

At my first meeting with them they kept jumping up my legs and scratching me with their paws. I kept petting them, because I wanted to make a good impression on my MIL but it hurt and I literally had PAW PRINT BRUISES all over my legs. All over. Imagine actual blue and yellow paw prints on your legs.

Time went by and I was petting them less and less every time I visited. I hated touching them. My partner used to say ""they keep jumping you because you don't greet them!"" well I don't want to touch them. They are disgustingly greasy, they stink and they are needy. It hurts when they jump and scratch me for attention.

They are the most untrained dogs I've ever met. One of them sometimes shits and pisses inside the house, so they have newspaper on the floor during the night. They let their dogs shit in the garden (but at least clean when they have guests, especially grandchildren, over), one of the dogs eat shit, they chase animals, they roll around in shit. One of the dogs growl when you move her (if she's taking up space on the sofa), she growls when you step on her toys and is insanely protective about her food bowl and often doesn't want to let the other dog eat. They will stare at you while you eat and will try to steal food from your plate.

They bark and howl so fucking loud whenever my MIL comes or goes or whenever they hear another dog on the TV or a bird in the garden or anything really. 

My brother in law would in the beginning try to place one of the dogs on me or near me, but has at least stopped doing that since I got pregnant.

Being pregnant in that house was actually the worst. The nausea was already very bad as I am expecting twins, but fuck if I didn't want to die already, a few seconds in their sofa sealed the deal. The house smells so fucking bad. It's disgusting. My sweet MIL (who is lovely, but unfortunately a bad owner) tries her best to keep it tidy and neat, also using an insane amount of cleaning products that were almost as equally bad for my nausea and allergies. I could barely breathe.

It's been 3 years since I first met these dogs and they have made me dislike dogs. I pretended to like the dogs or at least tolerate them for years but not anymore. I won't be rude but I am not going to lie any more. 

Before my partner and I were convinced that we were gonna have our own dog one day, but I've realised (with help of this subreddit) that I never ever want any dog in my home. Our cats are enough and that's it.

Sorry for the long and probably jumpy rant. But I needed to get it out fully without hurting my partner's feelings, who actually likes them. 

Honestly, a part of me hopes they pass away soon, despite having years to go still. And I feel bad because I know how much everyone else loves them (except one of my BIL's, who thankfully also hates them).

One of the dogs growl when you move her (if she&amp;#39;s taking up space on the sofa), she growls when you step on her toys and is insanely protective about her food bowl and often doesn&amp;#39;t want to let the other dog eat. They will stare at you while you eat and will try to steal food from your plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They bark and howl so fucking loud whenever my MIL comes or goes or whenever they hear another dog on the TV or a bird in the garden or anything really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother in law would in the beginning try to place one of the dogs on me or near me, but has at least stopped doing that since I got pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being pregnant in that house was actually the worst. The nausea was already very bad as I am expecting twins, but fuck if I didn&amp;#39;t want to die already, a few seconds in their sofa sealed the deal. The house smells so fucking bad. It&amp;#39;s disgusting. My sweet MIL (who is lovely, but unfortunately a bad owner) tries her best to keep it tidy and neat, also using an insane amount of cleaning products that were almost as equally bad for my nausea and allergies. I could barely breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 3 years since I first met these dogs and they have made me dislike dogs. I pretended to like the dogs or at least tolerate them for years but not anymore. I won&amp;#39;t be rude but I am not going to lie any more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my partner and I were convinced that we were gonna have our own dog one day, but I&amp;#39;ve realised (with help of this subreddit) that I never ever want any dog in my home. Our cats are enough and that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long and probably jumpy rant. But I needed to get it out fully without hurting my partner&amp;#39;s feelings, who actually likes them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, a part of me hopes they pass away soon, despite having years to go still. And I feel bad because I know how much everyone else loves them (except one of my BIL&amp;#39;s, who thankfully also hates them). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;Dr: I used to like dogs, but I hate my MIL&amp;#39;s disgusting untrained dogs and now dislike dogs in general.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, now he’s getting old and can’t control when he goes piss, so even though he’s technically potty trained, he can’t help but go piss inside.

But when it's about a *dog* rather than a human being, it's suddenly the saddest thing ever.


If you ask Reddit for sad movies, they often reply with these horrible dog movies that really do nothing for me emotionally, sorry. I can't even be bothered to watch or read Kujo which is supposedly scary, because it features a dog as one of the central characters and that just seems boring. 


Like today someone asked for the saddest death in a tv show, and someone replied ""Fry's dog in Futurama"". Wtf. There's actually some really sad and moving episodes in Futurama that involve Fry's family, and that go a bit deeper then ""dog lived a full life and finally dies forever in the year 3000"". It's so insane to me that people would rather cry about and remember the dog of a guy who got sent 1000 years into the future and lost his *entire family*. 


On a certain subreddit that is like us, but then with kids, people frequently talk about how much sadder it is to watch an animal die than a child. I once got into an argument with someone there because they asked if any animals died in We Need to Talk About Kevin and didn't give a shit if kids might die in it. Of course I got downvoted for that, lol. Because it ""makes sense"" to care more about ""innocent animals"". Like kids are not innocent...


The only dog-story I like is the creepypasta Dogscape, which is what the world is slowly becoming btw. 


On another board that I frequent someone asked this weird question that involved saving a child or a dog from falling off a cliff and one person argued forever about why they'd save the dog. Their arguments mainly consisted of shit like ""I work with dogs and think they're better blablabla"". Thankfully everyone else was *sane* and thought it was ridiculous to want to save the dog.


What is it with Reddit and dogs??? It's creepy as fuck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever the subject of death gets brought up you get these &amp;quot;Lol leE DeatTH iSs garreatT&amp;quot; jokes that are incredibly boring, neckbeardy and trite at this point. But when it&amp;#39;s about a &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; rather than a human being, it&amp;#39;s suddenly the saddest thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask Reddit for sad movies, they often reply with these horrible dog movies that really do nothing for me emotionally, sorry. I can&amp;#39;t even be bothered to watch or read Kujo which is supposedly scary, because it features a dog as one of the central characters and that just seems boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like today someone asked for the saddest death in a tv show, and someone replied &amp;quot;Fry&amp;#39;s dog in Futurama&amp;quot;. Wtf. There&amp;#39;s actually some really sad and moving episodes in Futurama that involve Fry&amp;#39;s family, and that go a bit deeper then &amp;quot;dog lived a full life and finally dies forever in the year 3000&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s so insane to me that people would rather cry about and remember the dog of a guy who got sent 1000 years into the future and lost his &lt;em&gt;entire family&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a certain subreddit that is like us, but then with kids, people frequently talk about how much sadder it is to watch an animal die than a child. I once got into an argument with someone there because they asked if any animals died in We Need to Talk About Kevin and didn&amp;#39;t give a shit if kids might die in it. Of course I got downvoted for that, lol. Because it &amp;quot;makes sense&amp;quot; to care more about &amp;quot;innocent animals&amp;quot;. Like kids are not innocent...&lt;/p&gt;

I actually have really bad memories about it. Because of her love for her 2 chihuahuas she has lost her morals in my eyes. She always worried more about her dogs then me. She literally used to cook a steak for the dogs and leave me without food, she never teached me how to cook either. (Don't worry i turned out to be an awesome chef by now, cooking is my passion) i remember coming home from school smelling delicious steak and then her telling me ""so what are you going to eat?"" Because the steak was for the dogs. She always left me alone to go to her boyfriend. When i was around 5 to 6 years old and we didn't have dogs back then she couldn't find a babysit alot of the times so she left me alone, i always felt sad, alone, depressed, angry and not wanted. We were rich so she though buying me everything i wanted would replace the motherly love i missed. My dad died when i was 17 after having cancer for 5 years. Before he got sick he was always working and away so untill he got sick he actually was quite a stranger to me. But in the 5 years i did had a chance to bond with him he was the only sane one in my eyes and always put me before the dogs, i really did feel loved by him and i regret i didn't appreciate it more. So he died and the night he died my mother told me she was going to her boyfriend. I begged her crying to stay with me and she wouldn't. I told her i felt abandoned by her and she got angry and left anyway. She said i would not be alone (referring to the dogs). Because of this i actually can't help but HATE small dogs, i can't stand them. Would never hurt them or anything i would still pet a dog but i prefer to not be around them. Now that i am 22, married and live alone with my husband i'm pregnant. I have a better bond with my mother now because i don't see her interactions with the dogs as much anymore. Only thing bothering me is that she always feels guilty when she leaves the dogs alone, she never felt guilty when she did that with me, at least not that i know of. It hurts that a dog gets more love and attention then me...

Maybe hating dogs would be too strong of a word to use, yesterday my stepdad's dalmatian died, it was a sweet dog i knew for 10 years i didn't cry but had a tear in my eye and felt bad for a few minutes, i tend to like dogs who are well behaved and trained like him. I just feel like alot of people are too invested in their dogs and have lost their morals. 

Another thing i hate is that the dogs always need to get involved in every single thing. Every single day she talks about them.
My mother is already daydreaming about her dogs meeting and sniffing my newborn. I don't want this! I don't want dogs sniffing and licking my childs face. Besides, one of the dogs can not be trusted anyway. She's angry that i don't want this and feels like i'm overreacting while i feel that she is overreacting. I think it's absolutely pathetic, unnecessary and uncalled for, not even worth a discussion to let dogs to ""meet"" my child as if they are a member of the family. It won't hurt the damn dog denying acces to a child, like seriously since when do people believe animals have the same feelings as humans? I have 3 indoor/outdoor cats, which i love in a healthy, responsible way don't get me wrong. And i am not looking forward to my cats, that i love dearly, to meet my child. I'm glad cats aren't licky little monsters though and tend to ignore most things around the house unlike dogs. But, they are still animals, who thrive on instincts. When i already feel this way about my own cats, let along what i feel with her dogs. 
I don't know if it's because i like cats more than dogs that i have this feeling but... ""dog people"" in my eyes really have lost their morals towards their family and other humans in general. I don't see this behaviour as much with ""cat people"" or people without animals.

So he died and the night he died my mother told me she was going to her boyfriend. I begged her crying to stay with me and she wouldn&amp;#39;t. I told her i felt abandoned by her and she got angry and left anyway. She said i would not be alone (referring to the dogs). Because of this i actually can&amp;#39;t help but HATE small dogs, i can&amp;#39;t stand them. Would never hurt them or anything i would still pet a dog but i prefer to not be around them. Now that i am 22, married and live alone with my husband i&amp;#39;m pregnant. I have a better bond with my mother now because i don&amp;#39;t see her interactions with the dogs as much anymore. Only thing bothering me is that she always feels guilty when she leaves the dogs alone, she never felt guilty when she did that with me, at least not that i know of. It hurts that a dog gets more love and attention then me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe hating dogs would be too strong of a word to use, yesterday my stepdad&amp;#39;s dalmatian died, it was a sweet dog i knew for 10 years i didn&amp;#39;t cry but had a tear in my eye and felt bad for a few minutes, i tend to like dogs who are well behaved and trained like him. I just feel like alot of people are too invested in their dogs and have lost their morals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing i hate is that the dogs always need to get involved in every single thing. Every single day she talks about them.
My mother is already daydreaming about her dogs meeting and sniffing my newborn. I don&amp;#39;t want this! I don&amp;#39;t want dogs sniffing and licking my childs face. Besides, one of the dogs can not be trusted anyway. She&amp;#39;s angry that i don&amp;#39;t want this and feels like i&amp;#39;m overreacting while i feel that she is overreacting. I think it&amp;#39;s absolutely pathetic, unnecessary and uncalled for, not even worth a discussion to let dogs to &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; my child as if they are a member of the family. It won&amp;#39;t hurt the damn dog denying acces to a child, like seriously since when do people believe animals have the same feelings as humans? I have 3 indoor/outdoor cats, which i love in a healthy, responsible way don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. And i am not looking forward to my cats, that i love dearly, to meet my child. I&amp;#39;m glad cats aren&amp;#39;t licky little monsters though and tend to ignore most things around the house unlike dogs. But, they are still animals, who thrive on instincts. When i already feel this way about my own cats, let along what i feel with her dogs. 
I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s because i like cats more than dogs that i have this feeling but... &amp;quot;dog people&amp;quot; in my eyes really have lost their morals towards their family and other humans in general. I don&amp;#39;t see this behaviour as much with &amp;quot;cat people&amp;quot; or people without animals. 
I&amp;#39;m an animal lover, but not a fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't hate dogs at all. I'd just rather not have one, but if I were forced to have one, I for damn sure wouldn't get a large dog. 

My neighbors, on the other hand have two dogs, a pug and some kind of retriever, I think. The pug comes out every so often to shit in my yard. The retriever is the dog I really want to talk about. When he was little and a cute little fluffball, the kids were all over him. Now that he's bigger, though...

Y'see, my neighbors have four kids. The dad has a job that has him working really long hours. The mom is a SAHM as far as I can tell. I'm a SAHM myself, so I'm home for most of the day. I also go outdoors when I want a smoke. I can be nosy about comings and goings if I wish.

I see the mom outside sometimes when she's painting something. The older children are almost never outside playing in the very large, beautiful and well-shaded backyard. Of course, there's school and the kids have other activities, but they don't play outside when they're home.

So the dog, no longer a cute, fluffy puppy and confined to the backyard gets ignored all fucking day. He's actually a very well behaved dog. He rarely barks. You can catch a whiff of dogshit when you're outside, but that's the only complaint I have. 

But now, my neighbors got a large above ground pool in the backyard. I see the kids outside just slightly more. Sure, it wouldn't be good for the dog to go crazy and get dog hair in the pool and possibly tear the pool up.

So now it's in a smaller enclosure in the backyard my previous neighbors built back when they were raising rabbits. 

The dog still gets ignored. I think I've petted and talked to it more than the kids have at this point. It's like a pitiful, stinky lawn ornament. 

This is the kind of pet owner I despise the most. There's a lot of idiots featured that probably have no business keeping a goldfish, but at least they fucking *wanted* their fucking dogs. At least they play and interact with their dogs apart from just feeding them.

She let's this thing drink from her water glass to the point where it will no longer drink from a dog bowl... the list goes on. 

Today, we were driving around town and stopped by the hardware store so I could get a new visibility vest for work. She brings the dog inside in her arms (it's about the size of a year old baby) and is promptly kicked out by the staff, thank god. I stay in and buy my vest while she's waiting outside, then we leave. 

Next up is the thrift store, which has a massive ""No dogs allowed"" sign on the front door. Mom is obviously getting annoyed while I just go on my merry way, get my throwaway shirts for work and we get back in the car. 

While we're driving, we get into a conversation about whether or not dogs should be allowed in public spaces. I bring up phobias, allergies, erratic and messy animals, dog hair and slobber getting over all the clothes and/or food in an establishment, and why anti dog zones are completely fair and for the better of the general public. Dogs don't need clothes or a six inch sub, so why should they have access? 

My mom responded; ""I know what my dog has done for me, I don't care about other people."" 

I have legitimately never been so disappointed and pissed off at this woman at the same time. 

I would honestly be lying if I said I wouldn't mind the dog being put down. It's old, arthritic, overweight, smells horrendous, has blood pressure issues which cost upwards of $300 a month (she does not work, and I'm sure as hell not paying for it,) is completely blind, going deaf and is by far the most spoiled shitbeast I have ever come across. She carries this thing EVERYWHERE, feeds it human food, and constantly complains about it drinking from her glass when 1) That's her fault it started in the first place, and 2) SHE NEVER MAKES AN EFFORT TO STOP THIS BEHAVIOR. 

I have been at home alone with this dog multiple times. It never cries, whines, anything except sleep and shit in the living room. I wish I was kidding. Still, she's 100% convinced that this dog cannot go a waking moment without her. I now realize that the dog *is* something coming between our relationship as mother and daughter and I'm considering bringing this up with our counselor. 

I know that with me now working full time, she's probably going to start badgering me about paying for her goblin's medical bills. I have no doubt about it. There is no way in hell I am going to spend an ounce of my paychecks or savings on something that only gets in the way of my mother and I's relationship and now, apparently, the wellbeing of other people. That might sound cruel, but also considering this thing's irreversible medical issues, age and declining health... hard pass.

For instance: I took her advice one time and tried to be nice and pet the dog..the fucking Chihuahua went out of it's way to let me pet it....then reached out and bit me in the hand after....told her about it and then it was ""Oh, well she might have just been a little grumpy""...THE FUCK?! Fuck that dog. My girlfriend walked out of the house and I was left with this same dog...As they left, the dog starts to get ballsy and starts barking aggressively and following me as i'm entering the kitchen. I'm 6'3 and this dog is a teacup so i'd admit, it surely is ballsy..but I decided today I'd had enough and picked the dog up by the back of it's neck to avoid being bit, put a muzzle on it and threw it in it's crate.

Parker Simmonds Solicitors and Lawyers litigation director Bruce Simmonds backed a push to ramp up patrols and increase fines to drive down attacks by vicious dogs on pets and their owners.

The drive for tougher penalties has been headed up by Robina councillor Hermann Vorster, who told the Bulletin existing laws were not doing enough to rein in owners and their aggressive, uncontrolled dogs.

Mr Simmonds described himself as a long-time supporter of tougher dog laws and said owners must be held accountable for their pet’s actions.

“Dog owners in town settings should be responsible for all actions of their dog. If they can’t look after it they shouldn’t have one,” he said.

“A dog should not be able to leave its home property to attack passers-by. In the country if a dog bit a person or stock it would be shot.

“What if the victim here was a child or a baby? Our dog laws are too lax.”

Mr Simmonds suggested any crackdown on vicious dogs should include a “requirement for owners of dangerous dogs to have public liability insurance cover for their animals”.

“We should have a system that says you must have compulsory third party insurance when registering your dog. If the dog bites someone, there’s automatic liability on the dog’s owner,” he said.

“The system could also provide for a substantial fine and the dog’s destruction if the dog’s insurance or registration lapses.

“Responsible owners will follow the rules, it’s the irresponsible or careless ones we need to target.

“If a person can’t insure their dog, they can’t have a dog, just as you can’t legally drive a car if there’s no CTP insurance.”

Mr Simmonds said Queensland dog owners should be “automatically liable” for their dog’s behaviour and be fined or jailed if they ignore their responsibilities.

I don't really dislike dogs - after all, I own one, who serves both as a pet and as a guard dog. It's pretty much a customary thing in my country to own a dog for those purposes. It's a shepherd dog, with a strong protective instinct and I naturally keep it outside, and enclosed within my backyard. Although, I don't really like others' dogs too much, and I absolutely loathe stray dogs and think they should all be put down but that's another story.

Where I live, there is a small amount of obnoxious dog worshippers but it's bearable. But if the situation in the USA is anywhere close to what I see on the internet... Boy, do you all have my sympathies. I am especially disgusted with people who think dogs are a substitute for children, and those who like dogs more than kids, to the point of despising children. That vile, disgusting, degenerate hellhole that is /r/childfree is a good place for those braindead idiots to gather, and pretend that children are somehow more annoying, dirty, or disgusting than dogs. Nevermind the fact that children are decently less likely to shit or vomit everywhere or bite someone's face off. The furbaby/furmommy bullshit makes me rage. 

Another thing that I don't get is why the hell do so many people seem to keep dogs, especially large ones, in apartments or houses, even if they have backyards? I would never keep even a small dog in my house, let alone a large one. Because they smell, can easily cause a mess, and after all, large dogs need space to run and let out their energy. It's cruel to keep a dog who is naturally supposed to be active inside for 8 hours, and then take it out for a 20 minute walk.

Moving on, the delusion of dog ""lovers"" can become dangerous, especially when it comes to pitbulls. I can't think of a reason why a sane person would want to own one of those hideous beasts. But these people just love saying how their aggression is totally not related to their breed, and how it's definitely the fault of the owner for not training it right, when one of those creatures eats off a 3 year old child's face. There's no denying that those dogs are dangerous, aggressive and useless, but not in some people's minds.

Another fun thing is when people have no problem seeing people die in movies or even real life, but the instant a dog is injured or dies, even if it's just a movie, they'll start crying and moaning about it. 

All in all, the obsession of certain people with dogs, and the famous ""I like dogs more than people, teehee"" makes me wonder what the fuck is wrong with them, and makes me wonder where society is heading.

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, the delusion of dog &amp;quot;lovers&amp;quot; can become dangerous, especially when it comes to pitbulls. I can&amp;#39;t think of a reason why a sane person would want to own one of those hideous beasts. But these people just love saying how their aggression is totally not related to their breed, and how it&amp;#39;s definitely the fault of the owner for not training it right, when one of those creatures eats off a 3 year old child&amp;#39;s face. There&amp;#39;s no denying that those dogs are dangerous, aggressive and useless, but not in some people&amp;#39;s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fun thing is when people have no problem seeing people die in movies or even real life, but the instant a dog is injured or dies, even if it&amp;#39;s just a movie, they&amp;#39;ll start crying and moaning about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the obsession of certain people with dogs, and the famous &amp;quot;I like dogs more than people, teehee&amp;quot; makes me wonder what the fuck is wrong with them, and makes me wonder where society is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

A huge black dog is owned by the neighbors across the street that snarks and barks at me or anyone when they pass by, wanting to be released to probably hurt us badly. 

This happened to my other neighbors dog. 
They were walking down the street to the woods like good people and the people across the damn street somehow let their dog loose. 

This dog bit and looked like it was going to kill my good neighbor’s dog. 
He left my good neighbor’s dog with slight injuries. It took a dog and human force to take the dog of my neighbor’s dog.

The animal control officer supposedly goes into the house and comes out 10 minutes later. 
He then tells us an outrageous explanation about why he will not take the dog away. 
He says that the family and the kids were crying and did not want their dog to be taken away. 

I don’t get this at all. My good neighbor’s kids were also crying that their dog was brutally attacked by an untrained-aggressive dog. 

Currently nothing has happened to the owners of the dog that attacked the other dog. It still goes wild whenever people or dogs are walking in the streets.
