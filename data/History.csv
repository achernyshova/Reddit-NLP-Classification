I first came across this in [Grimoires: A History of Magic Books](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6146412) by Owen Davies.

Anyway, most of the facts come from that book, as Davies has done a great job collecting this little tale. 


[William Lauron DeLaurence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._W._de_Laurence) was an interesting man who ran a publishing company (De Laurence, Scott &amp; Co.) and spiritual supply mail order service from Chicago around the turn of the 20th century. He is most known to occultist today for his tendency to copy other people’s works and slapping his name on it, but plagiarism wasn’t viewed the same way in the past and it was harder to prove. Products from his company are still banned in Jamaica, which naturally means his brand of ‘science’ has a certain prestige there. Still, those aren’t the stories I wish to tell you about. 

The story I want to tell you about is his leadership of a cult, The Order of the Black Rose, intended to elevate African-Americans by worshiping a perfumed cigar-store Indian and whose sister cult only allowed white women to join and then only after they had been weighted in the nude. (Oh, look I buried the lead two paragraphs in)

Knowledge of the cult came to light after DeLaurence told an initiate of The Order of the White Willow that she was, “too fat to be an angel.” 

Now, at the time, there was another more well known cult in the city founded by [Otoman Zar-Adusht Hanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoman_Zar-Adusht_Ha%27nish) founded around Zoroastrianism and fad diets. It continually had issues with the police and press in no small part due to the rumors about the sexual activities they took part in combined with claims it targeted wealth women and young boys. I’m sure everyone can guess what people are going to assume when DeLaurence’s organization comes to light in such an atmosphere. 

After hearing the complaint of Augusta “too fat to be an angel” Murie, the Chicago police raided the headquarters of the Orders and arrested a number of white women, black men, and Delaurence himself for offences under the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act). This was doubly bad timing as the world heavyweight boxer, Jack Johnson, was awaiting trial for “crimes” under the same act for taking a white woman from Minneapolis to Chicago for “immoral purposes.” 

At trial, the prosecution elected to only go after the orders for fraud, and Murie testified about how DeLaurence had hidden dictographs to record his disciples so he could later pretend to read their minds. DeLaurence was fined $200 and everyone was released. DeLaurence seems to have walked away at this point. 

The cult was supposed to have been disbanded, but in 1923 Helen La Maie said her husband tried to [sell her in exchange for a gambling debt](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19231207&amp;id=jgAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HboEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=978,3778385):

All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)

There are plenty of people involved here - historians who have to examine the perspectives of the people who wrote these histories, whether it is from other books, letters, drawings, diaries and so on; then you have the people themselves who even wrote these stories in the beginning which could differ in context, description, accuracy or exaggeration; then you have the authors of the history books, the academic articles, the websites and the forums online, and then you have the teachers and the students who learn and teach what they know and spread the message along. 

So obviously, then it comes to histography and passing those histories along, there is a possibility that errors might come up, perhaps a person understood the story in a different way, or when passing the story by word of mouth could lead ommission/addition/change of certain details, translations from different languages can lead to possible inaccurate mistranslations as different language may not have the exact word of every word from another language or certain words or phrases could interpreted differently, and so on and so forth.

&lt;p&gt;All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone knows the story of Hitler's aspiration to become a great painter prior to WW1, a dream that shattered with him being denied admission to the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (probably because of his art being considered by the admission officer(s) (or the Academy's equivalent) as ""mediocre"" or ""unoriginal,"" which would have stood him no chance in a very competitive applicant pool).

&amp;#x200B;

Some people like to discuss this anecdote of Hitler's life as a ""what-if.""  Say, if Hitler was accepted into the academy, somehow, would he not embark on the extremist and violent path we all remember him now for?  Could World War 2 not have had happened (at least the World War 2 we know), and world history be very different accordingly?

&amp;#x200B;

That is all very intriguing - at least in my view - to think about.  However, I am more curious about whether said ""what-if"" ever occurred in the minds of the people who rejected Hitler's application.

It is incredible (and incredibly disturbing). It should be required reading for everyone (especially the final chapter), especially as there are currently concentration camps being run by the US government (and funded by the citizens of the US) in operation throughout the country. 

It documents the actions of the titular battalion as they commit mass shootings, ghetto-clearings, and deportation actions throughout their assigned district in Poland during 1942 and 1943. By Browning’s estimation (supported, in part, by the meticulous records kept by the unit), they ended up shooting at least 38,000 people and facilitated the deportation (to Treblinka) of at least 45,000 more. 

The book seeks to understand why ordinary people are able to participate in genocide. It does so by using post-war interviews from members of the battalion as well as official reports and other primary sources from the war years and examining these through different lenses (psychological explanations, economic motivations, etc.). 

Here are a couple of quotes that give a sense of the answer as to how/why people are capable of committing such horrific actions: 

“A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain [why people are able to commit/facilitate genocide]: wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity. These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but non without qualification” (p. 159).

“The collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or threat of war. Everywhere society conditions people to respect and defer to authority, and indeed could scarcely function otherwise. Everywhere people seek career advancement. In every modern society, the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. Within virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms. If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?” (P. 189)

All of those conditions resonate with me as I look at the state of the world. Books like this one underscore the vital importance of history in guiding us during challenging present times in the hope of creating a better future.

Granted LOTR is fantasy, but it is a fantasy about a semi-medieval or pre-modern world. So in the context of such a world, child and infant mortality would be rather high.

I've also had this thought when reading about Abraham Lincoln and how the death of one of his children deeply affected him.

Statistically, the chance of children surviving into adulthood has greatly increased in the last 200 years, but I'm still not quite sure how to flip that statistic to evaluate a statement like:

""being a parent before modern times typically meant having to bury a child""

Note: I am not in ANY way trying to lessen or diminish the anguish that losing a child must bring to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

If we can establish that this is the case (that before modernity, being a parent typically meant some of your children would die before you) then when did the balance flip?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know if Richard Owen was still a distinguished fellow of the Royal Society by 1858.

The information I have collected is controversial.

The RS website shows his being VP in 1849-1850 and 1857-1858 and receiving the Royal Medal 1846 and Copley Medal 1851.

However, other sources say in 1846 he was voted off the councils of the Zoological Society and the Royal Society on account of the Chaning Pearce scandal about Owen's paper on belemnites. 

The book The life of Richard Owen does not shed much light on this issue.

Could anyone give me more precise information?

So this is a story that has never been published and that might be unique in the history of WWI, and it's my first time sharing it somewhere. A few years ago I found a few postcards albums in an old barn in the countryside of France, postcards that were dated from 1890 to 1930 more or less. The story behind this is that the family who had these postcards was actually some kind of crazy old people who used to steal postcards from old mailbox, when it used to be a public yellow PO box in the street. So the albums are actually full of hundreds of postcards from random people who send news to their families.

So of course, this postcard has never be read by the addressee, and by anyone else.

Here is the translation of the text of the postcard :

""**29 of august of 1918. My dear Quilecaille (family name).**

**So is it working for the extension? I do not know if Devallet has returned a second time, I am going to write him. I believe I will receive a medal, I found a way with my fire pump to drown a boche** ***(insult for German)*** **bombing aircraft from 9000m away in air, that right there is some nice work. You will see this in the newspaper (le Petit Parisien) except there won’t be my name, there will simply be M. X. Anyway I am on it. I wish you health and soon the end of the war. Your friend Boucher.**""

So that's it, an old true letter of a pilote sending a message to his friend, telling him that he found a way to drown an airplane up in the sky. He might have been running out of ammos and probably used it fire pump and sprayed some water or foam on the other airplane.

&gt;The [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation) didn't take root in Iberia, France, and Italy because their languages are somewhat [mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) with [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Language). This allowed even illiterate churchgoers in those places to understand Catholicism, making them harder to sway by Protestants.

At first, the claim made sense to me. But then it dawned on me ""*Why didn't Protestantism catch on in Ireland or Poland, since their languages aren't mutually intelligible with Latin?*"". Also, to say that the Reformation was an ""outgrowth of Germanic cultures"" disregards the large numbers of Germanic Catholics in Austria, Bavaria, Switzerland and Belgium.

So why did the Reformation catch on where it did? 

* Was it just due to the stances of governments? If so, why did certain governments, such as those of Italian city-states, Spain, Portugal, France and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth stick with Catholicism?

* How come some regions were able to strongly resist conversion to the religion of its government? For example:

   * Most Irish stayed Catholic despite being under Protestant British rule

   * Most Ukrainians stayed Orthodox despite being under Catholic Polish-Lithuanian rule

   * Most Poles stayed Catholic despite being under Orthodox Russian rule

   * Most Dutch remained Protestant despite being under Catholic Spanish rule

* [Johann Gutenberg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg) 
[Printing Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_Press) is often credited for the spread of the Protestant Reformation. 

   * Does this mean that had another European nation invented the printing press first, they would be bound to be the starting place of the Protestant Reformation? 

   * Was there really a correlation between literacy and the spread of Protestantism?

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of weeks ago I saw a post by a guy on here, who was asking how retreating worked in the ancient times.

Now I was wondering, how long did medieval battles usually last. I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the battles shown in hollywood movies (e.g. Braveheart, where people swing swords, hit armor and cut through limbs without a problem).

 Especially the fact that a lot of armies were composed of levy troops, so I'm assuming the following things about them, please correct me if I'm wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

\- only very few troops had training, military expertise and knew how to fight

\- morale was generally low, as you were fighting wars for your feudal lord/king

\- fighting one on one, or against muliple enemies, especially in close quarters is very tiring business, so once you used your weapon for more than lets say 1 hour, you would become very tired and morale would lower even more. (Of course depending on the whole status of the battle).

\- the equipment of most drafted (levy) soldiers would be of very poor quality

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I'm only assuming those bulletpoints, I haven't read enough sources about the period but I'm very interested to hear your guys qualified opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions: How long did a medieval early and highperiod pitch battle usually last.

It was quite brutal, casualties are estimated to be 750 to 1000 and the total amount of warriors would have been around 4000 men. You can read more about it [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308033_A_Bronze_Age_Battlefield_Weapons_and_Trauma_in_the_Tollense_Valley_north-eastern_Germany) or [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/slaughter-bridge-uncovering-colossal-bronze-age-battle) if you prefer the TLDR version, as well as look at images of the bones and weaponry. Arrows embedded in bones, cracked skulls, bronze spear tips and wooden clubs were all found at this site. Some arrowheads were bronze while others were flint. Evidence of mounted combat has been found as well at this site.

What is interesting to me is that the battle seemed to happen at a border point between three newly emerging cultures; the Proto-Germanic peoples from the Nordic Bronze Age, The Urnfield culture that seems ancestral to the Celtic peoples and the Lusatian culture, a pre-Slavic culture which lived in what is now Poland. Genetic testing showed that the people who fought at this place were quite diverse, some people clustering with modern Scandinavians, some with central and southern Europeans and some with modern day Poles, I think this correlates quite well with the cultural regions. Isotropic evidence has shown that some people who died at this battle grew up eating millet, which was not a common crop in northern Europe at the time.

Some of the findings at this battle were not weapons, but golden and tin spiraled rings. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308166_Bronze_Age_tin_rings_from_the_Tollense_valley_in_Northeastern_Germany) is another publication from researchgate which discusses these rings in detail. I do not think these were ornamental, but rather ingots, and this publication seems to agree with me.

The Urnfield culture originated in Southern Germany and Austria, which are rich in metal ores, Tin in particular occurs in the Ore mountains which is on the Border of Saxony and Bohemia. I think this is why the Celtic culture was so widespread in early central Europe, as they had access to a lot copper and tin, which means that you can make bronze. Which is really good for trading, and it probably gave birth or accelerated their warrior elite social classes.

So essentially these Proto-Celts were the cool new kids on the block, with fancy shiny armor, weapons and ornaments. These people would go around and trade, and other people thought they were cool and wanted to be like them, so they did. This brings me to the Lusatians, the pre-Slavic Poles.

The Lusatians were heavily influenced by the Urnfield culture, as their ancestors, the Trzciniec (I had to google that), traded with the predecesors of the Urnfield culture, the Tumulus, which ultimately gave rise to the Lusatian cultures.

The third people in this story were the people of the Nordic Bronze Age, or the Proto-Germanic people. The ancestors of the Germanic tribes that would plague the Gauls, the Romans, the Britons, and not to mention the Norse, who raided across the entire world. Despite what the Romans, Arabs or the recently converted Anglo-Saxons and Franks would have you believe, the Germanic tribes were not just a bunch of brooding dumb barbarians and neither were their ancestors. The NBA people had extensive trade with both the Lusatians and the Urnfield cultures, since bronze artefacts are commonly found but tin had to be imported. We know that centuries later, the climate in Scandinavia seems to get tougher and since there already was limited farmland, these Germanic tribes start migrating southwards and push the Celtic peoples back.

so here is what I think happened:

A big trading caravan from southern central Europe makes it way up north to trade with the Lusatians. These were dangerous times, especially since Indo-European societies loved to raid for some reason. This caravan is therefore well protected by mercenaries from different parts of the Celtic sphere, some of them mounted on horseback. Professional soldiers with bronze weaponry. This trading caravan is travelling north to trade metals like gold, tin and bronze, and probably return with amber and furs, maybe slaves too. But while crossing the Tollense river, this caravan gets attacked by a giant warband of marauders, hailing from the north. These Proto-Germanic people probably were the ones responsible for the wooden clubs and flint arrowheads, although I do think the wealthier individuals had bronze weaponry with them.

Unfortunately not enough evidence has been found to indicate who won or lost this battle, however the amount of bronze weaponry we find is quite low. No swords have been found yet marks clearly made by swords have, so someone must have taken the swords from the battlefield. The bodies were also dumped into the river so I think it was pretty clear that they were pillaged after the battle. I do not think a big trading caravan in foreign land which just got attacked by a giant group of raiders would have any interest in collecting the bronze weaponry spread over the battlefield, but the people who attacked with flint arrowheads and wooden clubs would. But who knows, swords were pretty expensive at the time so maybe the figured it was best to at least bring back the swords since the trading excursion did not seem to work out.

This battle is really fascinating to me because I think that the battle probably set the stage for the early history of northern and central Europe. A prequel to the Germanic expansions into Celtic, and later, Roman lands.

* How are contingencies measured and planned for?  

   * Do armies employ statisticians to try and enumerate the likelihood of say, a vital oil tanker being scuttled and thus plan accordingly?

&amp;#x200B;

There's something very attractive about starting with the primary source to me: is somehow feels more authentic and if it has literary interest in its own right you get the full experience without 'spoilers'. But primary sources can be heavier going and occasionally somewhat impenetrable, so the risk is that you read it all without understanding some underlying concept (or worse, imposing some false understanding derived from Rome Total War or something).

&amp;#x200B;

I think my own conclusion in practice ends up being that whatever order it's in I need a clear and reasonably vivid narrative to hang things off to take on more detailed information: if I think the primary sources will give that I start there, otherwise with secondary (sometimes pretty simplistic secondary sources rather than deep analysis just to get the outlines).

Hi all, I was wondering if any of you might be able to help. In the hierarchy of things, the Empress is the 'first wife' of an Emperor. She is from a high-ranking background. This is followed by the other consorts and then by the concubines who might be from a lowly/common background.

From what I have read so far and according to a discussion I had with some friends, I understand that the emperor is not allowed to have other women before the empress and he is not allowed to have other children without first having consummated the marriage with the Empress?

I went into this discussion thinking that consorts are basically concubines and are not legally married to the Emperor and that the only legal marriage is with the Empress. Sure an emperor might love the consort but he doesn't have the power to make her an Empress because she is from a lowly background. Also, this makes all children that the Emperor has with his consorts/concubines illegitimate.

It's a bit confusing and I'm no expert so these are my questions:

* Can an emperor have a child with a female consort without having married an Empress? \[So basically he has a child with a female consort FIRST and then after the child is born he decides to marry a high-ranking woman and name her Empress instead of the female consort.\]
* Since the emperor can't marry the female consort because she's from a lowly/common background, when the child from this consort is born, will he/she belong to the Empress because of the legal marriage? Or how does it work?

If anyone can direct me to some books/articles etc. to read and clarify on these points I will be very grateful.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Imperial Chinese Harem System: The difference between Empress, Consorts and Concubines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am designing a strategic board game that takes place in the Pacific Campaign, right now I am specifically focusing on the Battle of the Coral Sea to test some of the games core mechanics.

I have already found what aircraft were used on the Carriers Yorktown and Lexington during the battle but I am particularly interested in the composition of their Fighter, Bomber, and Torpedo Squadrons. I figure looking for the composition of the Carrier Air Wings is the best place to start in that endeavor.

For some background, I have already accessed the bulk of the USN's archives on both of the above listed Carrier Air Wings (both were established in 1938) but can find no information prior to 1950. I understand that because all of these original documents were physical, there is some chance that they have not been digitally archived to the fullest extent.

&amp;#x200B;

 Example Below

## Portuguese Man at War

This is the name given to a very dangerous species of jelly fish. The real reason behind it resides in how well equipped this creature is, and is a comparison to the way the Portuguese ships fought in India.  


Vice-Roy of India, **D. Afonso de Albuquerque**, a military genius of the highest degree commanded a fleet of six ships manned by four hundred men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20.000 men army on land ready to dispatch the small Portuguese flotilla.

When the **King of Ormuz** sent aboard an emissary to question Albuquerque, the great Commander told the messenger one phrase: **Surrender yourselves !!!**

This must have provoked an inner laugh from the messenger who left.

When the battle begun, **Albuquerque** made his fleet circle like a carrousel and destroyed most of the ships. He then proceeded to conquer Ormuz with 400 men.

How could this be achieved one must ask. The technical explanation may make some sense, but will not explain the courage of taking such a risk.

In fact we all know that during the U.S.Civil War, canons had to be loaded from their mouths. This was in the XIX Century. However Albuquerque’s canons were equipped with breeches that did not require the canons to be brought backwards to be loaded. It meant that while the enemy’s canons fired a shot, the Portuguese canons could fire six with a range of 1.800 meters against 700 meters of the enemy’s canons. The next issue is that the Portuguese artillery men had discovered the propulsive effect of water. If you throw a stone at a low angle near the surface of the water, the stone will be propelled by the water’s surface and gain more speed.

The second row of canons were placed very near the floating line and the stronger fire power was further enhanced by the water effect, causing the steel balls to not only hit the ship but hit the one behind the first one. Being fired at close to the floating line, the ships would start sinking very fast.

Then one must be aware that the Portuguese knew they were always outnumbered, a certainty that led them to employ all their courage and determination in the fights and battles they engaged.

In many cases, just mentioning the Portuguese would distress an entire army or fleet, knowing the fierceness and bravery of the Portuguese warriors.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been reading about the Portuguese and how well respected and feared their military prowess was back in the ol&amp;#39;Portuguese Empire but I&amp;#39;ve always thought the casualty numbers didn&amp;#39;t seem right.

1.

Macedonian infantry was leagues better but it was vulnerable in obstacles for example the rivers at Issus and Granicus which Alex still won. I’d like to also point out that Persians also had good Greek mercenaries. When it comes to cavalry, imo Gaugamela proves that Persians had quality cavalry, despite having more than the Macedonians. But other than that, Alex killed a massive empire in 4 years and he has incredible battle tactics, evident by him not losing a single battle. 


2. Napoleon Bonaparte- Conquered most of western Europe after all the other powers declared war on him and brought most of them to their knees. He also fought 60 battles only losing 8 and also implemented the corps system very effectively.

3.(tie) Hannibal Barca- Although many people say he’s a bad strategist, I don’t anyone could’ve done better against Rome at the time. When it comes to tactics, I think he’s the best here for obvious reasons. 

3.(tie) Julius Caesar- Conquered Gaul and won the Civil War against incredible odds. He was very good at strategy, tactics, and logistics.

5. John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough- Was amazing at everything, won some incredible battles, and never lost a single one. 

6. Subutai- In the end, he won against everyone he fought, he defeated his enemies and was very fast.

7. Jan Zizka- He was blind, and he defeated imperial armies with his peasant army while outnumbered and never lost a single battle.

8. Khalid ibn al-walid- He fought a lot of battles and only lost once, and he destroyed Byzantine armies time and time again. I would’ve put him higher if the Byzantine army was actually good and if Muslim sources didn’t exaggerate enemy numbers.

9. Scipio Africanus- Great strategist who conquered spain and defeated Hannibal and Carthage.

10. Arthur Wellesly, 1st duke of Wellington- He fought great battles in India, defeated Napoleonic France in Spain, and went on to defeat Napoleon himself, although he got lucky.

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Portuguese were the best shipmakers in the world during the 15th and 16th century. However we have a big issue : we never found any plans about Naus (portuguese carracks)  and we never found enough of a shipwreck to learn more about their size or their shape.

&amp;#x200B;

such big ships were rare for this time. In fact i never heard of any ship with the ability to transport this much men and pieces of artillery.

the only sources we have are from portuguese and some are from italians which were there at the conquest of tunis in 1535.

I knew they were likely out of date as pure history, and I'm enjoying Beard's more rigorous historical account.

I still recommend Gibbon and Mommsen, though, and I wanted to explain why.  Both Gibbon and Mommsen are great storytellers and very revealing of the mindset of their respective times and countries — Gibbon at the onset of the British Empire, Mommsen at the onset of the Prussian Empire.  Both looked to Rome for a model, but drew very different lessons.

Gibbon, living in a country with a history of internal religious conflict, admired the iron rule of great pagan emperors like Marcus Aurelius, and sought the continued separation of church and state and strong rulers chosen by merit.  Aurelius and his four predecessors were all chosen by merit and adopted by the previous emperor.

Mommsen, on the other hand, living in a “Germany” with a long history of division into small states, was more interested in the fall of the Roman Republic and the rise of Julius Caesar.  Mommsen did not mourn the Republic, admiring the strong ruler who could create an empire out of bloody factional chaos.  Yet both Gibbon and Mommsen interpreted history for their own purposes, with an agenda that rendered their tales suspect.

Beard does a great job of separating legend from fact.  She also tries to look at the life of ordinary people, including many slaves, although that’s not easy when there were no biographies written about them.  She points out that for ordinary people during the 200+ years the empire was at its height, it did not seem to matter much who was emperor.

It does not seem clear to her that the bad emperors were as bad as advertised (usually to justify their assassination), or the great emperors as great as advertised (lauded by their chosen successors), or that any emperors were even as important as advertised (by Roman historians who often had their own agendas).  Beard has the modern skepticism of the Great Man Theory of History previously accepted without question by ancient Roman historians and many 18th and 19th century historians.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as i love the movie, now i'm older and have looked into the background i have even more questions.. Basically why was the movie made in the first place? it is a movie which took a huge amount of resources to produce and yet it was made by the Soviets rather than by Western nations, featuring tens of thousands of Soviet military personnel as extras and was filmed in the Ukraine, despite the events covered in the narrative not featuring the Russian's to any extent, i'd understand the Russians making it if it was a movie about Austerlitz or Borodio.. I understand the production was co-funded by the Soviet Union and Italy.. what is going on with that relationship? why would the Italian and Soviet states co-fund a film production, surely at the time of filming (1969/70) the relations between NATO Italy and the Soviet Union were a bit more frosty? And it raises even more questions since the Italians also do not featuring in the narrative! Despite it being a Soviet production several prominent Western actors appear in the movie, not least Christopher Plummer and Rod Steiger (who play Wellington and Napoleon respectively) was it not unusual for an Englishman and an American to appear in a Soviet production?

Basically why was the movie made in the first place? it is a movie which took a huge amount of resources to produce and yet it was made by the Soviets rather than by Western nations, featuring tens of thousands of Soviet military personnel as extras and was filmed in the Ukraine, despite the events covered in the narrative not featuring the Russian&amp;#39;s to any extent, i&amp;#39;d understand the Russians making it if it was a movie about Austerlitz or Borodio.. I understand the production was co-funded by the Soviet Union and Italy.. what is going on with that relationship? why would the Italian and Soviet states co-fund a film production, surely at the time of filming (1969/70) the relations between NATO Italy and the Soviet Union were a bit more frosty? And it raises even more questions since the Italians also do not featuring in the narrative! Despite it being a Soviet production several prominent Western actors appear in the movie, not least Christopher Plummer and Rod Steiger (who play Wellington and Napoleon respectively) was it not unusual for an Englishman and an American to appear in a Soviet production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if any of you can shed any light on this topic, i appreciate it is pretty niche but any insight would be appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;

This strategy would last untill, of course, the offensive of Caporetto where the situation on the Alpine front would become extremely different.

Also I'd like to know to which extent this strategy was successful, of course the Austrian army was fighting on many different fronts at the same time, this would surely put their life reserve on a timer, i know that roughly a third of all Austro-Hungarian casualties happenned on the Alpine front (without considering the almost 500,000 men captured during the Vittorio Veneto offensive) so i wonder how those number fit in the complessive strategic situation.

Finally I'd like to know if such strategy of attrition could've worked without the intervention of German forces on the Alpine front, i know that in many situation the Austrian forces were approaching their total collapse so i want to know how much of this was due to the italian offensive/battles on the Piave.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read in many books about ww1 that after the first 2 failed offensive on the Isonzo River Cadorna dropped his plans to break through Austrian formations and employed the &amp;quot;shoulder tackle strategy&amp;quot; where he would attack over and over, with the hope of generating enough casualties to make the Austrian army crumble, disregarding his own casualties in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

My thinking is: Mainly because the war goals of both conflicts basically remained the same. The two principal conflicts in both were Austro-Prussian conflict over Germany (specifically Silesia) and the Anglo-French conflict overseas.

The threat of war constantly loomed, causing the dramatic shake-up of the alliances during 1755-1756. 

Some point to the 8-year peace between, but what is the point of peace where we can divide wars into two separate occasions.

(Longer story) I was playing a mod (Floris) for the game 'Mount and Blade: Warband'. For those who don't know what this game is about (I highly recommend it for gamers), it's a medieval RPG where you build a character, recruit lower ranked troops, fight battles and gain experience for you and your party. Depending on who you recruit, these troops can branch off (In a 'Troop Tree') to become different types of fighters. You can build an army of heavy infantry units, a fast moving cavalry or highly accurate archers depending on how you feel. It's an AWESOME game with cool fighting mechanics and a great story line that you can essentially build yourself. A nod to the historical accuracy of the game is included at the beginning, stressing the fact that if you choose a female character to start, you will have limitations.  Anyways, among the recruits you can take into your army are women.  These women start out like all other recruits, wearing simple farming clothes and carrying improvised weapons. But as they expand, they join different classes, including 'Women Militia, Amazon, Jungfrau and Truus te Paard'. So after seeing this, I started to wonder... Were there any groups or classes of warriors in any culture, throughout history, that only included women? Like I said before, any search on Google only gets results about individual female warriors that were famous. I get it, in many cultures throughout history in the world, women were not expected or considered to become warriors. But I've still heard of groups like 'Shield Maidens', (Which after researching have discovered that their existence is still debated, because no accurate historical evidence has shown that they were actually a thing) so I was wondering if there were any more examples of this.

I'm not sure how early the Chinese would have been introduced to chainmail or even if they independently developed it and disgarded it previously, but considering it is known that Han Dynasty China and the Romans/Sassanids had established diplomatic relations and trade existed between Europe/Near East and China as early as 140AD why didn't chainmail become as prevalent in China as it did in Europe?

From the 1840s to the 1890s &lt;em&gt;(aka the &amp;quot;Naughty Nineties)&lt;/em&gt; specifically.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the 1920s, many women became Flappers, Victorian Values were rejected and more and more people were having casual sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question I ask was just how common was casual sex in the 1920s? Was it more or less so than in the 1960s and 1970s? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were the attitudes toward casual sex more accepting of promiscuity in this decade than in previous decades and the following decades?&lt;/p&gt;

The women in the very first class of female recruits for Winston Churchill’s Special Operations Executive (the SOE) were the very first women in combat. They were trained in everything from explosives to encryption, sharp-shooting and hand-to-hand silent killing—and were parachuted into France ahead of the D-Day landings to commit acts of sabotage, rally and train the resistance and cripple the Nazis before the Allied invasion of Europe. We all know the story of D-Day, and with the 75th anniversary this week, it’s important to examine what so many of us don’t know about the invasion through the stories of these incredible women who helped make it possible.

&lt;p&gt;I’m here to answer your questions about these women, their impact today, and this fascinating moment in history – so ask me anything!&lt;/p&gt;

And I found this interesting little section in ""Iron Fist: Classic Armoured Warfare Case Studies"", by Bryan Perrett:

https://imgur.com/a/rXiGuGb

In case you can't read it, it describes a gas attack by Japanese troops against British tanks in April of 1942. Two incidents are mentioned: one where a phial is thrown but misses, and one where it is thrown into a Stuart tank ([the phial used in these attacks](http://www.inert-ord.net/jap02h/grenades/tbgas/index.html).)

The whole crew, except for the commander Sgt Campbell, is incapacitated, with Campbell being unscathed as a result of having his head out of the turret during the attack. Campbell then takes back control of the tank, and removes it from the road, before turning it's guns on the site of the ambush. For this action he received a Military Medal.

Naturally, this story peaked my interest. It's fairly odd for one thing: gas was nowhere near as used in combat in WW2 as it had been in WW1, and it's fairly well known that one of the reasons no one broke it out on a large scale for combat purposes, against the other major powers, was due to fear of retaliation. It therefore seems odd that Japanese forces would utilise gas grenades only once, and never bother with them again, as surely if you're going that far you might as well keep it up. 

It's also a bizzare method of disabling a tank, as I'm sure many would agree. Thirdly, there are no citations directly, but it is very specific on the details: 16th April, Sgt Campbell, Burma, Military Medal. These details are the kind of thing that can be checked, so I wanted to.

So now I'm interested. It's a odd story, and I want to know more. I get a couple of my history nerd friends to help me out, and we start to dig deeper. 

First place we find this story replicated, is Tank Tracks to Rangoon, also by Bryan Perrett. [It describes the incident again in a little more detail](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dEURBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%227th+Hussars%22+%22Sgt+Campbell%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivjaGa2NriAhWJThUIHS2NDGwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%227th%20Hussars%22%20%22Sgt%20Campbell%22&amp;f=false). Same author though, so we can't take it as truth, and it also doesn't give any sources on this incident. We gotta look elsewhere.

Next answer: we go hunting through old newspaper archives, since they'd include this sort of thing. Unfortunately, I failed to make any progress on this front. No mention of our Mr Campbell. 

Eventually, we try going for medal records. [We get to this site.](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/british-military-gallantry-medals/#3-how-to-find-records) We try to find it: no dice. 

We've almost given up by now, but someone points out a name in Tank Tracks To Rangoon: a Lt John Parry, who was the commander of Sgt Campbell. I plug this name into Google with ""Burma"" added in a last ditch hope, and while I don't find any accounts written by him, I do find [something else.](http://www.hut-six.co.uk/WW2data/WO373-Burma%20and%20India.html)

According to the site it's a list of all recommendations for honours given in the region we're looking for. This seems like our place. So we pop in Campbell, and we get... 18 results. Luckily Perrett gave us a fair few details about him so we can sort through them, and we get: Cecil Campbell, a Serjeant in the 7th Hussars who got a Military Medal in 1942. There's also a link to the recommendation, number 0988. 

This takes us to [here.] (https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7363952) ([for those who for whatever reason can't get into that, here's a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/cMuhJIh)

Nothing we didn't know already...but there is an image of the record. If anywhere contains a mention of this incident, it will be the record of the recommendation. Now I could pay £3.50 (??????) to access this without a watermark, but I'm lazy and poor, so that won't happen. Instead, we're gonna do it the hard way.

[For those who want to strain their eyes, a link to the image.](https://imgur.com/a/3Mpz5ZK)

It's not ideal. But you can just read enough. It says: 

""the enemy attacked with gas grenades. All members of the crew except Sgt Campbell, including the driver, were rendered insensible. Although himself feeling sick and giddy, Sgt Campbell climbed into the driver's seat and drove the tank back 100 yards. Sgt Campbell then manned the gun, and in spite of enemy mortar fire, succeeded with his troop leader in inflicting casualties on parties of the enemy in a building and in the open.""

So, that's the story confirmed. Despite it seeming fairly outlandish, and despite (as far as I can tell) only one book covering this incident, it was completely true! 

It's honestly fascinating that this actually occured, and even more so that no one talks about it. Hats off to Perrett for finding it, and thanks must also go to Geoff Sullivan, who is credited with creating the website that allowed me to find his citation. Finally, credit goes to my friends for joining me in such a bizarre search for a small detail in 2 paragraphs of one book.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So earlier today, I got a little bored and was reading through a couple of my old books about WW2.

I engaged in a bit of a thinking exercise as in which country was the strongest country in the World at any one point. This doesn't follow any strict objective criteria, but most of the time, I feel, it is not difficult to identify the strongest entity which in most cases defaults to China. There are times where this might be more difficult to do, like in the period between the years 600 AD and 900 AD. The main guidance I used for myself is territorial size and population size (this holds until the contemporary period, where the power dynamics in the world become different). The chart always gives an event as a reason for change.

This is by no means meant to be an authoritative list but simply a fun exercise for myself. If you disagree please tell me which country you would place as number one at any one point and for what time period. Please also note the following guiding principle of this list: if one country is listed as strongest and in the meantime another country grows to a point where one could reasonably claim that these two are of equal strength (e.g. China (Han / Xin) and the Roman Empire) then the country that was initially number one retains the number one spot until it is confidently surpassed (an example of such is China (Sui) and the ERE).

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

And as they were talking about the various Sultan in the early 1600&amp;#39;s they offhandedly mentioned that the sultan may have a had a squad of deaf or mute assassins that would take out targets within the empire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was just way too interesting to let slip by.  I&amp;#39;ve been trying to track down a source talking about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally the Podcast host is pretty good about sticking to the sources &amp;amp; to actual events.  Though occasionally and pretty openly picking the more interesting version of the story, and occasionally speculating about what may not have been recorded.  But in this case I can&amp;#39;t find anything directly talking about Mute or deaf assassins.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find out that the Ottoman court during that time did have its own version of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Sign_Language""&gt;sign language&lt;/a&gt; that was often used by the messengers &amp;amp; pages and even executioners at court.  But haven&amp;#39;t been able to track down anything about assassins.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any body ever come across a source that can help clear things up?&lt;/p&gt;

Morocco had several advantages in becoming a potential major power in the Atlantic:

* Islam, like Christianity, is a proselytising religion which wants more and more people to convert to it.
* Morocco wasn't a military pushover, as demonstrated by them defeating and killing [King Sebastian of Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_of_Portugal) in battle.
* Morocco's territory extended further West and South than anywhere in Western Europe, giving them less distance to cover to get to South America.
* Morocco was far more technologically advanced than the states of Sub-Saharan West Africa
* The location of Morocco just South of Europe meant that:
   * It won't take too long for European inventions to spread to Morocco.
   * Having a direct land route to the Middle East along the Southern shore of the Mediterranean meant that Middle Eastern inventions wouldn't take too long to spread to Morocco.
* Morocco under [Ismail Ibn Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif) was an ally of Great Britain, and continued being an ally for several decades after his death.
* Moroccans did develop sufficient seafaring capability to sail the treacherous waters between Morocco and the Sub-Saharan parts of West Africa.

So why didn't Morocco become a major power in the Atlantic or colonise the Americas?

* Were they prevented from adventurism by domestic troubles?
* Did they lack funds to start colonies?

From my understanding, Ancient Europe seemed to have a really diverse and broad degree of cultural diversity and technology, from the Celts to Latin Rome to Germanic tribes to Hellenic Greece to the Iberian cultures to the Norse. These cultures all seem very unique and distinct from each other, but as I look more into European history, somewhere along the way I sort of notice that European culture as a whole seems to become increasingly similar, especially during the early modern period, where European culture as a whole seems very uniform (For example, comparing ancient Norway to ancient Spain, they would seem totally alien to each other, but in the early modern periods, they do have their differences but they might seem more alike then different).

Obviously, each nation and people retain a significant amount of independent national and cultural significance, but overall, Europe at some point seems to have gotten rid of the diversity in unique ways of life in favor of homogeneous ideas like urban living, agriculture, firearms-based warfare, etc. Even the clothing for most of Europe seems to become very similar in the early modern period, although there were difference between fashions in countries, from my perspective it seems very similar overall.

Is there any specifiable point where Europe went from these diverse cultures and ways of life into the more homogeneous 'civilized' life we know of now?

A history newbie here. I have become interested in Mongol history. I noticed that they were extremely brutal and destructed and conquered a large portion of Asia, the Middle East, India, and Russia.

To me, it seems most of these countries were traumatized afterward.

Also, the rise of communism, fundamentalism, and a generally cynical view about the world exists in this part of the world. It seems these countries lost hope in humanity. They saw the dark side of humanity and to them, any powerful country is a reminder of Genghis Khan.

(Another book I really enjoyed was &lt;em&gt;Lenin&amp;#39;s Tomb&lt;/em&gt; by David Remnick; this had a lot of more personal stories and explored Western attempts to undermine the Soviet system a bit, but, obviously, was still focused on the downfall.)&lt;br/&gt;
Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

## Good luck!

What would jewish fighters be equipped with/ wear during the first Roman jewish war?

I know they used captured Roman gear, would they repaint the shields, if they did would they paint it blue with a menorah? 

I’m also aware that at the time, Jewish people would have worn sudras, and tallits, any thoughts on this? Sudra being worn vs a a helmet? Tallit as the cloak?

Roman gear,  https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/417357090442309722/

Gladius (with belt)
Rank belt 
Tunic 
Sash belt
Chain mail / segmented plate
Helmet
Shield  (rectangle )
Spear (Roman long metal thing)
Scarf 
No pants/ pants? The X legion came from Germania?
Cloak
Sandles 
Padding for under the amor 
Mess kit/ the Roman brief case hiking bag thing

Would the Jews use a different style of shield/spear? How long was their tunic? Any repainting?

Would they wear the rank belt?/ jewish ranks?

Edit: grammar and spelling","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not all too sure if this is where I can post this, but I was scrolling through Facebook and came upon a picture of the “Xolo” dog, a dark colored, hairless dog from Mexico. The Aztecs and Mayans believed this dog was a guide for the spirits in the underworld. Upon looking at the dog, I couldn’t help but notice how similar they look to Anubis, the canine looking God/man associated with guarding the underworld and patron God of lost souls. I couldn’t help but get excited at this semi-coincidence and wanted to share it with those who also find things like this fascinating. I attached a link below from Nat Geo talking a bit about the history of the Xolo dog.

Was communism more popular or less popular amongst the people of South Vietnam?

Obviously, many South Vietnamese wanted to be independent from North Vietnam and/or opposed communism and we’re willing to fight for it. But was this the opinion of the majority?

From what I’ve read, North Vietnam and South Vietnam weren’t really two countries, but rather two regions of the same country governed separately after the French vacated their colony there. The Geneva Accords, in which peace was brokered between the French and the Viet Minh, separated the two regions, but the separation was meant to be temporary until general elections could secure reunification under a single government. The War began after the President of South Vietnam refused to allow the planned elections and reunification in 1955 causing North Vietnam to seek reunification through force.

The South Vietnamese government’s stated reason for not allowing the elections was that they did not sign the Geneva Accords therefor they didn’t have to follow the accords. But that sounds to me like spurious reasoning from a government that may not have thought it wouldn’t get the mandate of the people if the vote took place.

I sincerely apologize if my understanding of these events is wrong or incomplete. I am the opposite of an expert. I was raised in Reagan’s America and was taught about the Vietnam War through the prism of a career military family that believes all wars Americans engage in are done so for ‘Freedom.’ Thank you to any clarity you all can provide me to better understand why this war was fought in the first place.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were the citizens of South Vietnam popularly opposed to reunification with North Vietnam prior to the start of the war?&lt;/p&gt;

I sometimes wonder if liberators with sticky fingers would be inclined to hold onto a few precious mementos?

On p374 he says ""The rest [of Thuringia] passed to the Wettin family [...] who managed to repel royal efforts to escheat it as a vacant fief,"" but how does the emperor make the case that it is ""vacant"" in the first place when there is clear inheritance.

Another  example would be the battle of Agincourt, where there was a small  contingent of men-at-arms attack the English rear, but not to attack  their battle lines, rather to raid the baggage train.

So, I know that the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were generally hated by the public until their executions in their own land by a foreign power, and I feel like the same applied for Collins in 1922 after his execution by his own countrymen. He definitely gained a lot of support from Irish Republicans after Bloody Sunday, his 12 Apostles, giving financial support to the families of fallen rebels, etc., but I know he also made many many enemies both overseas and in Ireland for the same things.


I understand the hatred people had for him and the free-staters after the signing of the treaty in 1922 to let England keep control of the northern counties. Collins was definitely more of a militant leader and didn't mind taking the fight directly to the English, but he seemed to know that the treaty was a necessity to an eventual free Ireland. Meanwhile, De Valera seemed to be less about action, but refused to accept any sort of treaty. This probably made it a very hard decision because putting Collins in charge of the Provisional Government could only further intensify the tension between the two countries: England hated by many Irishmen because of centuries of oppression, and Collins hated by England because the new 'leader' personally gave orders to have dozens of British Soldiers and spies executed and led a military revolt against them.

Could Michael Collins have gone on to lead the Irish Republic and eventually achieve full Irish Independence through his own methods? Or was his execution needed to put a less militant leader in power and promote future peace talks between the two Nations?

&lt;p&gt;Carlin stated that the Celts ranged from Britain down to Portugal across to Galatia (Anatolia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the title questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do the Gauls play into this culture? Are they one in the same or different? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What identifies the Celts from other ancient cultures and how were they ruled? As a nation or independent tribes?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;— [Dr. Peter McLaren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McLaren), author of *Che Guevara, Paulo Freire, and the Pedagogy of Revolution*[\[260\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-260)

If Che Guevara became such an iconic figure because of his rebellion and martyrdom, why did it specifically have to be him? Perhaps the only more iconic martyr figure is literally [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_christ) himself.

Why didn't, say, the [Scholl siblings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_and_Sophie_Scholl), [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.), [Mohamed\_Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi), [Boris Nemtsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov) or [José Rizal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_rizal) become as iconic worldwide as Che Guevara? Like Che Guevara, these people were all martyred by unjust societies for their resistance, but unlike him, they could not be blamed for any atrocities. Also, these people aren't [communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), so their legacy shouldn't be tarnished by association with communism.

Speaking of ""rebellion"" and ""martyrdom"", does this mean that a few decades down the line, t-shirts and posters using  [Osama bin Laden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_laden)'s image could become common? To me, Osama bin Laden's story sounds somewhat similar to that of Che Guevara, so could this phenomenon repeat and turn the perpetrator of [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) into a globally-revered icon of rebellion and martyrdom?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The image of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara""&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/a&gt; is very widely known worldwide, but especially in his native Argentina. His image is used to symbolise a lot of things (see quote below). Even people who are vehemently &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; communist use his image. I bet if Che Guevara knew that his image would get put on non-communist-related items, he would be very pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Che&amp;#39;s remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations—rebel, martyr, rogue figure from a picaresque adventure, savior, renegade, extremist—in which there was no fixed divide among them. The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel, a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie, the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence—the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist.  &lt;/p&gt;

1. Did the Romans widely use concrete out of volcanic ash? I have found a source that made me infer it was mostly only used for large projects like the Colosseum, Pantheon, etc,  while the rest of the empire used weak mortar using burned limestone. Simply, I am asking if volcanic ash could be transported hundreds of miles in order to make cement.
2. When a source says a people used a limestone mortar, I have found that means it hydrates Calcium Oxide, just one of the bonding agents in modern cement. Does anybody know the chemical equation for this reaction?  I found that Tricalcium and Dicalcium Silicate (3CaO+SiO2) reacts in modern cement, but limestone only includes CaO and volcanic ash seems to only include SiO2 alongside aluminum and iron. Did the Romans use both to make cement? Is more than just limestone needed to make cement?

A scale on which history knows no other. So earlier in the podcast Neil talks about the separation of species ( during the Ice age when people crossed The Bering Land Bridge) and how this was a unique point in history when there were essentially two separate world's who knew nothing of one another. This separation is one if not the single most driving force in the reason why European disease sweeped through The Americas the way it did.

I cannot reasonably see how it is possible that i could simply go to another country which i have never been and pick up native diseases and possibly die and spread that diseases  (Malaria, Schistosomiasis, ebola ect) in 2019. Yet at a time where two separate populations of humans are meeting after thousands of years of seperation at a time with much older medicines, the disparities are so drastically different between their effect on us and our effect on them that is seems unreasonable... my theory is what if the disparities weren't as big as we think? What if the worst already came thru. Through history we see many instances factual and debateable when people from the the known world discovered and or migrated to the new world. Yet we see no instances (that I'm aware of) where people from the new world discovered the old..is it not possible, that some events in history could be explained by people accidentally coming from the new world as Columbus did trying to discover india but did not have the means, intentions, knowledge or effect to have made it into the history books, similar to what Leif Erickson did unaware of the significance of their discovery. What if even though they aren't in the history books the effects they had are. I read an article today about how the the bubonic plague has been traced to have originated from Asia based on dna testing https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php. it's funny how I read this today considering in the podcast Neil DeGrasse  mentions how the people crossing The Bering Land Bridge were more than likely people of Asian decent and when the bridge went back up they could only mix with there own genes. So if they populated the Americas their off spring would be of Asian decent all the way until colonization of the americas, although not retaining only Asian features do to micro evolution (Darwanism) after thousands of years in a different enviorment. Now for my question would it not be possible for something like the emergence of The Black Plague to be caused by one person or a group of people going to ""The Old World""?

Yet we see no instances (that I&amp;#39;m aware of) where people from the new world discovered the old..is it not possible, that some events in history could be explained by people accidentally coming from the new world as Columbus did trying to discover india but did not have the means, intentions, knowledge or effect to have made it into the history books, similar to what Leif Erickson did unaware of the significance of their discovery. What if even though they aren&amp;#39;t in the history books the effects they had are. I read an article today about how the the bubonic plague has been traced to have originated from Asia based on dna testing &lt;a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php""&gt;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php&lt;/a&gt;. it&amp;#39;s funny how I read this today considering in the podcast Neil DeGrasse  mentions how the people crossing The Bering Land Bridge were more than likely people of Asian decent and when the bridge went back up they could only mix with there own genes. So if they populated the Americas their off spring would be of Asian decent all the way until colonization of the americas, although not retaining only Asian features do to micro evolution (Darwanism) after thousands of years in a different enviorment. Now for my question would it not be possible for something like the emergence of The Black Plague to be caused by one person or a group of people going to &amp;quot;The Old World&amp;quot;? Are there any other historical events that could possibly be explained by the idea that native Americans found their way to the &amp;quot;The Known world&amp;quot; .. precolonization?&lt;/p&gt;

I was just reading an article on homosexuality in history (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/), and something that struck me was how ideas and quotes from past philosophers managed to have an influence on their current politics, and can still be used to defend ideas or positions. A recurring theme in this article is the idea that a ""truth"" is told, and remains the ""truth"" without exceptions (despite science) - and if you're an exception, the governing body will help ease the confusion by making it not exist anymore, at times more so strictly than others.

Part of what I'm wondering is if in those times, it wasn't just ""Man has real good thought, let's follow"", rather more of an ecosystem of interests that helped influence policy and develop ""society"", and if this is talked about in different contexts of history (or perhaps about relationships between the thinkers and the policy makers).

Back to the gays, I'm wondering if things like spreading illness (no disposable, flushable anything at any time before 100-200 years ago?), or personal insecurities (anything non consensual sucks, probably happened a lot, still does, still sucks), or lack of availability to proper lubricants (""unnatural"" indeed if it hurts) had any influence on the minds of policy makers and followers / enforcers, and if it has been written about (I suppose people didn't write much about swollen anuses, but did they?).

This is what I’m taking about, it’s completely NON seethrough, covers the whole face nice and tight, and is a mask.

I see these all the time in video games, contemporary art, and even medevial art. And also in art that is suppose to be accurate depictions of certain soldiers.

But in real life whenever I see this (on reenactors and cosplayers) their masks tend to be very loose and wag and wave all over the place when they move and fight, and the chains are so loose and see through you can clearly see their entire face underneath the mail.

So are these badly made loose re-enactor masks or is that actually how those masks looked and functioned in real life.

I’m asking because personally I think it looks really lame when it’s all loose and seethrough and looks incredibly terrifying and badass when it’s 0% see through and you can’t see anything but the persons eyes, and the mask is tight on their face and now waving all around and moving all around, and flipping and folding upwards whenever they move or fight in it.

&lt;p&gt;So does anyone know if party membership was a requisite to joining the SS, and if it wasn&amp;#39;t, was there pressure applied inside the SS for it&amp;#39;s members to join the Party?&lt;/p&gt;

I don't actually follow any sport closely. 

I am a citizen and resident of Australia, a former British colony. The most popular sports in Australia are swimming, surfing, cricket and ""football"" sports (i.e. Rugby League, Rugby Union and Australian Rules Football). However, soccer is only modestly (but increasingly) popular in Australia, despite our coloniser, the UK, being very much into soccer. After all, if cricket took root in Australia due to British colonisation, why not also soccer?:

* How come soccer didn't take root very much in other British colonies such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India?

* How come soccer did take root in South Africa, another former British colony, especially among indigenous South Africans? 

* How come soccer is more popular than cricket in the former British colonies of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore?

The reason I ask this question is because I have spent the last 7 weeks travelling around South America, and all the countries I have visited (namely Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) are very much into soccer. I am not surprised, considering that the colonisers of South America, Spain and Portugal, are also very much into soccer.

I was born in the Philippines, a former Spanish colony in Southeast Asia, but somehow, soccer failed become popular there. 

* Instead, the most popular sports in the Philippines are boxing and basketball.

* Basketball was spread by the Americans (or what Latin Americans call ""Estado Unidense"") when the Philippines was their colony, so is American influence the reason why soccer failed to become popular in the Philippines? 

* I doubt that the low level of Iberian immigration to the Philippines (at least compared to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) was the reason why soccer failed to become popular there, because soccer did become popular in the majority-indigenous nations of Peru and Bolivia. 

Speaking of sports spread by the Spanish, how come bullfighting:

* Did catch on in Mexico (I know Mexico's not in South America, but my dad has watched bullfighting there in 2008), Peru and Colombia.

* But did not catch on in the Philippines, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile?:

* It seems especially odd that bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay, considering their abundance of cattle.

* I doubt that animal rights concerns were the main reason why bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay. 

Finally, how does climate influence the popularity of sports?:

* For example, I know that the popularity of swimming and surfing in Australia is influenced by our hot climate and our population being concentrated around the coasts.

* So how come soccer can be popular from the taiga climates of Northern Europe, to the Mediterranean, to the Amazon Rainforest, to the Argentine Pampa, to the Bolivian Altiplano, to the Atacama Desert?

* Considering that soccer caught on in the Philippines' neighbours such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia (a former Dutch colony), I doubt that climate was what prevented soccer from catching on in the Philippines.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I am not trying to promote or denigrate any sport here.

I've always found it hard to get into other history books I've tried, but the quotes from and stories about ordinary people in this book really gripped me, especially the accounts of Welsh Miners and their libraries.

Is there a category/style of history book that this falls under? Is it just social history?

Can anyone reccomend any other books like this, especially focusing on the United Kingdom?

I got pulled into the rabbit hole and been trying to get more information about this person.  I hope to get some help here.



Here is what I know so far.  The man known as ""The Wise One"" lived in a rural village in China.  He is very wise and many people would come to seek his guidance.  One day the emperor came to visit him.  The emperor took the man to his palace as and adviser on how to run the country for the good of his people.  The man was there for over ten years.  At this point, ""The Wise One"" was on the same status as the emperor.  He had a great desire to go back to his rural home.  The emperor was reaching an old age and knew his death was approaching.  He allowed the man to go home.  The people in his home town were joyful upon his return.

Besides, Ivaylo's reign ended after a year, when he was killed.

My contribution:

I know that Iced Sweet Tea here in the Southern United States was exactly that in the 18th and 19th century. Before the invention of modern refrigeration Ice had to be gathered from frozen lakes and shipped across the world, and lots of product would melt before reaching to its destination.

White sugar was the most expensive and most refined end product of cane sugar manufacturing. Lots of slave labor was used in the production of cane sugar, and the human cost and suffering was immense and horrible.

And finally Tea, an already fancy drink. Here in the South we drink black tea, which lots of it was imported.

So sitting on a large slave plantation, sipping from a tall glass of Sweet Iced Tea was not only refreshing for the upper-class, but a symbol of their wealth and power.

I don’t think the ancient Greek philosophy of “living a virtuous life”, “rule by many” just happened randomly, but I don’t have much knowledge of how the Greek lived and what are the social factors that might contribute to democracy. 

In general the west seems to be more aware of the legitimacy of the government than the their eastern neighbors, England had the Magna Carta long before the Enlightenment, France and Netherlands had the revolution, Scandinavian countries are closer to “socialism” than any country in the world who claim themselves to be. 


My theory is that this has a lot to do with the population. 

The east was much more populated in general, think about China and India, in a place where there are more people than available resources, competition becomes fierce. People need to “step over” others to get the resource they need, they can only do so by violence. Ruling by fear is the only working way, otherwise it will be in chaos. 

Democracy is a social contract that seems to be much more acceptable in a situation where resources are abundant with people had their basic needs fulfilled. It also seems to be more likely to happen in an isolated, peaceful place where war is not a huge threat. 

When there is less people it also make lives more valuable. The enlightenment thinking emphasizes greatly on “human nature”, I doubt in a overly populated, highly competitive society it will be possible to have the same respect for “human rights”. 

But then I was thinking, is it true that agrarian civilization tends to be more populated? Why Europe was never as populated as the east?

I understand why Israel Putnam was ordered to fortify Bunker Hill specifically, as it was farther from the guns of the warships, taller than Breed's Hill, and closer to Colonial reinforcements. Furthermore, some work had already been done on Bunker.

And yet, when the Massachusetts Militia arrived in the night, Colonial officers disagreed on where to make their stand-- Bunker or Breeds? Fortifying Breeds would go against orders, for one thing. The only thing in favor of Breed's was that it was closer to Boston, so colonial forces could better see-- and maybe even shell-- the city proper. But this does not make sense to me, as the current maneuvers were purely defensive, and the cannons had not yet arrived from Ticonderoga.

We all know what happened after-- the British took Bunker hill and forced the rebel Militia to retreat, despite it being a pyrrhic victory-- 1/6 of all British officer casualties in the entire war happened at this battle.

I can't help but wonder whether the Massachusetts Militia would have been able to hold the position had they chosen to follow orders and occupy Bunker Hill rather than Breed's.

I understand why Israel Putnam was ordered to fortify Bunker Hill specifically, as it was farther from the guns of the warships, taller than Breed&amp;#39;s Hill, and closer to Colonial reinforcements. Furthermore, some work had already been done on Bunker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, when the Massachusetts Militia arrived in the night, Colonial officers disagreed on where to make their stand-- Bunker or Breeds? Fortifying Breeds would go against orders, for one thing. The only thing in favor of Breed&amp;#39;s was that it was closer to Boston, so colonial forces could better see-- and maybe even shell-- the city proper. But this does not make sense to me, as the current maneuvers were purely defensive, and the cannons had not yet arrived from Ticonderoga.&lt;/p&gt;

Title: A girl dressed as man in the army for five years, was found out and raped, then attempted suicide (sorry for the bad translation.. that's pretty much the whole story tho)

Content: The Xichang ROC army found a cross-dressed female soldier, and the story spread around the city. This soldier is 17 years old, from Tibet (XiKang at the time) and has been in the army for 5 years as an orderly. One day in April, an company commander found that his wife lost a piece of clothes, blamed this orderly and forced ""him"" to compensate. The girl ran to another commander for help, but got tied up and sent back to the original company. The original commander was enraged that the girl wanted to escape, and wanted to spank ""him"" 100 times, strip ""him"" naked and banish ""him"" from the army. The girl begged to be hit in the palm instead, but got denied. The commander had 4 other soldiers flip ""him"" over and hit ""him"" with a carrying pole. The girl passed out at 70 hits, and then the 4 soldiers poured cold water to wake ""him"" up, and hit another 30 times, for 100 in total. They stripped the girl's upper clothes and were surprised to find chest binders. Then they stripped ""his"" pants and found out ""he"" was a girl.

It turns out that this girl escaped her family because she was forced to marry someone. She said she was in a middle school, but she refused to share any info about her parents or address. The story got out and shook the city, people flooded in to care for her, and gave her pocket money. Females students came in and shook hands with her in tears  (weird but it's in the original text).

However, the commander and the 4 soldiers got into fights over who's gonna marry this girl. And before the girl could fully heal, she was raped and attempted suicide out of disgust and guilt, but was eventually saved.

The original commander was enraged that the girl wanted to escape, and wanted to spank &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; 100 times, strip &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; naked and banish &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; from the army. The girl begged to be hit in the palm instead, but got denied. The commander had 4 other soldiers flip &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; over and hit &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; with a carrying pole. The girl passed out at 70 hits, and then the 4 soldiers poured cold water to wake &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; up, and hit another 30 times, for 100 in total. They stripped the girl&amp;#39;s upper clothes and were surprised to find chest binders. Then they stripped &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; pants and found out &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; was a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this girl escaped her family because she was forced to marry someone. She said she was in a middle school, but she refused to share any info about her parents or address. The story got out and shook the city, people flooded in to care for her, and gave her pocket money. Females students came in and shook hands with her in tears  (weird but it&amp;#39;s in the original text).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the commander and the 4 soldiers got into fights over who&amp;#39;s gonna marry this girl. And before the girl could fully heal, she was raped and attempted suicide out of disgust and guilt, but was eventually saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little depressing...&lt;/p&gt;

Rome had a special governing system in that there was no definite source that the throne derived its legitimacy from. For example, the United States government derives legitimacy  from the people whereas the chinese dynastic system derived power from the Mandate of Heaven.

Any topic/era is great (my personal obsession is ancient Rome but I want to learn more about anyting). Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

But with a united crown, it seems a little more complicated, right? Because Scotland would never be independent from the English lineage. Scotland, even as an independent nation, would pretty much be ""owned"" by the crown in Buckingham?

I know the concept of a ""United Kingdom"" is to unify the nations. But this is not the case. The monarch of United Kingdom is today a symbol of exclusive Englishness; if anything, a republic would represent Scottish interests better than a crown in London.

Maybe I just never paid attention in class, but these people are waaay more interesting than I thought they were. I’m only about four stories in and there is so much that I didn’t learn in class.

For instance, when Christopher Columbus presented his plan to sail across the Atlantic to the Spanish king, the king sent out an expedition of his own in secret. The crew returned to Spain after encountering heavy storms and claimed that there was no possible way to reach Asia by sailing west. Can you imaging the confidence and bravery that Chris must have had to go anyway?

Example 2: After a much longer than expected journey around South America, Magellan’s first contact with Asia was with a small island. The natives immediately stole everything not bolted down on the ship, and the island was dubbed the “isle of thieves.” Later in their voyage before going home, Magellan decided to exact revenge on the islanders. As they landed on the shores, they were met with hundreds of arrows, the natives being hidden by foliage. Magellan was captured and killed. When the defeated crew pleaded for the natives to return his body to be buried, the thieves refused, claiming that they would display it as a warning to any more cocky sailors.

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

## Good luck!

If those two games accurately depict life back then in their respective time periods, while ignoring the fictional elements (beastmaster stuff, Isu weaponry and animus, etc), what was life like IN-BETWEEN those time periods?

For comparison, in Far Cry Primal, the setting was 10,000 B.C. where villages and clans lived amongst woolly mammoths and sabertooth tigers in the reclining Ice Age. The people lived in huts made of wood, mud, stones, animal bones and fur, and survived the days as hunter-gatherers using weapons of sticks and stones. On the other hand, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is set in 431 B.C., where the Greeks have already established civilization in large cities made of marble and statues made of bronze, with trading markets importing all over the Mediterranean, developed farms, organized military, and innovative politics.
