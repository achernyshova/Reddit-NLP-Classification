If you're looking for engineers to interview for a school assignment or for your job hunt, this is the right place! The AskEngineers community has compiled a list of hundreds of practicing engineers across different countries, industries, and specializations to help answer your questions about what they do in their job, how they got there, and offer career advice to those that need it.

**Note:** Please be courteous when requesting an interview. Everyone on the list is doing it on a volunteer basis only, and they are not obligated to respond or help you. Our users reserve the right to deny any requests for interviews and/or personal information. Harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported to the authorities.

###How to use this list

1. `Ctrl + F` the engineering discipline, country (e.g. US, UK, Germany, etc.), or other criteria you're looking for looking for. If you need to be able to verify someone's identity, search for `Available for e-mail?: yes`

1. Parse through each search result and message up to 3 users that you think will be able to answer your questions. **DO NOT shotgun PMs to every user!** If you don't intend to interview everyone, don't waste their time by sending messages that you won't respond to later.

1. If the first few users don't respond within 24 hours, try messaging another user.

---

###Interested in conducting interviews?

By signing up, you're volunteering to let high school students, prospective engineers, and new graduates PM or e-mail you with interview questions. Typically with students it will be for a class assignment (i.e. Intro to Engineering), so questions will be about about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. Think of yourself as a STEM Ambassador.

You will receive anywhere from 1-4 requests per month on average, with some surges in January, July, August, and December due to new and graduating students. While these lists usually have over 100 sign-ups and is set to contest mode, which prevents the same users from getting bombarded with requests, engineers in an in-demand discipline may get more requests than average.

####Requirements

1. **At minimum, you should have:**
  * a BS / B.Sc in engineering or engineering technology, or an equivalent amount of self-study, and;
  * at least 3 years of professional engineering experience

1. **Commit to answering at least two interview requests per month**. Don't list your information if you aren't willing to volunteer roughly ~2 hours per month to conduct interviews.

####How much time does it take?

The first interview you do will take about 1 hour, depending on how detailed you are. After that, most interviews will take &lt; 30 minutes because you can copy-paste answers for repeat or very similar questions. That said, please be sure to read every question carefully before using previously written answers.

####How do I sign up?

Copy the template below and post a top-level comment below. **Note:** ""Available for e-mail"" means you're OK with the interviewer sending you a personal e-mail to conduct the interview, usually for verification purposes. If you want to stick to reddit PM only, answer 'no' to this question.

**This is purely on a volunteer basis.** To opt out, delete your comment here below. Once deleted, you will no longer receive requests for interviews.

    **Specialization:** Power Turbines

I saw most posts are news events which is great, but I didn't see any prohibitions against career threads so I figured i'd ask out of curiosity.

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually my first post in reddit so excuse me for any format mistake or even grammar as I am not a native speaker.

Let me give some information about me so you guys can understand the situation in order to help me or give me some advice. I am a Mech Eng. I finished my degree about 3 years ago in the Dominican Republic and I've been working in the mining industry for this time, I studied this career mainly because I love cars and motorsports especially Formula 1 but in this country there is not much to do in the automotive sector as there are no industries that build cars and about racing there are barely a couple of tracks and they usually bring cars from other countries to race (Drag races and circuit).

&amp;#x200B;

During this last year I've been in the process of admission to study in the US, to do a masters, took TOEFL, GRE, got accepted at Uni. and got the Visa, my semester starts in almost 2 months (Fall 19). I also  want to mention that my family is living in the US and I am getting the green card in about 3 years, so shortly after I finish the masters I will be legally able to work in the US, so I have two questions for those of you that are in this industry or have some knowledge about this. For the masters I plan to focus on subjects that are automotive focused, How can i Join the motorsports world in the US? And what should I be learning before jobhunting in order to have an atractive profile to join as an engineer in this world, even though I really dont have any experience with this?.

Here's the **situation of the stop automation control in our church organ**:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e\_/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e_/view?usp=sharing)

* organ stops were originally controlled by pneumatic force
* late 90's an upgrade was done using DC servo motors, to which a metal disk was attached and to that a shaft that would push/pull the stop. Switch sensors at 0 degrees and 180 degrees and some electronics took care of positioning.
* currently, some of the motors are defunct, others have broken gears, still others provide too little force to move the stop

More details on the **requirements**:

* the linear action is 1 inch
* the speed should be fast, if not almost instantaneous (imagine the organ being played, pulling some stops and having to wait seconds for them to become active !)
* the force required for the heaviest stops would be around 200N (rough guess, I didn't measure it)
* special requirement: when *pushing* the stop, it should be pushed *completely*, preferably with some residual force to keep it in position. This is something that could be achieved by adding a spring between the actuator and the stop?
* retrofitting the electronics, using the current wiring (12VDC power lines + 1 control wire that has 0VDC/12VDC, depending on the required position)

I've been looking for linear actuators that fit these specs, but I'm not really convinced they'll provide a good solution, because the speed is generally low; the fastest that I could find, list a speed of 1""/s and that's definitely my limit!

When searching to buy online, Chinese manufacturers have models that *seem to suit* my requirements for around $30, while prices in US/EU start at $100 and up all you want (and I'll need at least 10 and up to 25 of those for the organ!). 

So here's where the more experienced readers can be of **help**:

1. are there other types of actuators that would do the trick? Is a linear actuator a good solution (and do I really have to give in on the speed requirement?). Or is the current servo/disk/shaft setup still the best option?
2. what mechanical component/construction could be used to connect the actuator to the stop, in order to have a ""permanent push force""? Is there some ready-made spring-containing component that can be used for this?
3. how can I connect a typical 2-wire actuator (reversing polarity to control direction) to my 3-wire setup (line 1: 0VDC, line 2: 12VDC, line 3: 0 or 12VDC, controlling direction)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve researched different materials and finding that size in lumber is not only expensive but hard to find. So my next available choice is to double beam each joist which adds even more cost.

I’ve considered LVL beams but also cost is an issue. There are 80+ beams that will eventually need to be replaced but I plan on doing them in stages due to my budget. 

Finally, I’ve priced steel c-joists which I believe to be the best choice since they are lighter and have a lot of advantages such as fire, termite and moisture resistance. 

Simply dropping the replacements into the old slots seems unstable and structurally  unsafe.  Luckily I have access below and there isn’t any structure above but it must be able to withstand heavy snow accumulations. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

I have about 5 years of experience under my belt and as of the end of 2019, will have my MSME. My BS is in engineering as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I stand out among the rest of the traditional crowd ?&lt;/p&gt;

To all of you who underwent a MSEE, how heavy is the math? For my EET program, I took two semesters of calculus, which was really calculus I, II, and III (we went into vector calculus for the last 1/3rd of the second semester). 

I have learned of CU's new MSEE program through Coursera. The program will not require that I have all the math courses of a traditional engineering program. 

My question to you guys: do you think the lacking of math courses will make this too a difficult task? I watched CU's webinar on the new program, the department chair only referenced the importance of calculus courses for the program.

&lt;p&gt;I got an MEng in 2016 and been working for nearly three years now, I got the impression that it was important to get chartered, but at both the companies not many guys (or the first company, and kind of the second) were or seemed that bothered by it. If I push myself I don&amp;#39;t think it would take too much longer but is it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for any chartered guys, is finding work/getting better pay actually been easier, or is that one of the things they say to get you chartered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

What material is the buffer (spring) made of, and what would be the metal that it would be mounted on? I know it should probably be some ductile metal, and the metal it is mounted on should not deform but I really cannot find any specific metals listed.

On March 24 2015 the pilot went to use the bathroom. Andreas locked the pilot out of the cockpit, increased speed to maximum, and deliberately crashed the plane in the Alps. All 150 people on board were killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Air traffic control knew there was a problem with the flight, as it began rapidly losing altitude.

&amp;#x200B;

In such an instance would it be possible to engineer a remote cockpit where pilots on the ground could take over the plane and fly it to safety? Maybe each manufacturer would need a remote cockpit at their facilities with the ability to log in to an aircraft in flight. The flight crew would need to be locked out of the avionics system to prevent them from tampering with the remote pilots controls.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 8, 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 also went rogue and nobody really knows what happened to it. It seems to me that if Boeing had the technology to remotely fly that plane the 239 people on board would still be alive.

&amp;#x200B;

On October 25, 1995, 6 people, including pro golfer Payne Stewart, lost their lives when the Learjet 35 they were on suffered sudden pressure loss. If Lear had the technology they could have executed an emergency descent and landing, possibly saving the lives of all on board.

&amp;#x200B;

On September 3, 2010, UPS flight 6 suffered a fire. The plane was flyable, however the 747 cockpit was so filled with smoke the pilots were unable to see their instruments or look outside the windscreen. Unable to line up with the runway at Dubai the plane crashed and both pilots were killed. Despite the severe damage to flight systems the plane was flyable. If Boeing had a remote cockpit it is possible the plane could have been landed and the pilots saved.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is September 11, 2001. Passengers called from those planes on cell phones and reported the hijackings. If the planes had been able to be remotely piloted many lives could have been saved.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this type of technology feasible? What are some of the limitations to developing this type of technology? How do you imagine such technology could be integrated into new and existing aircraft?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m imagining something like a flight simulator with a high speed satellite connection. At the first sign of an emergency it could be manned by an emergency flight crew. They would log in to the distressed aircraft. The simulator would get all the planes telemetry. Cameras throughout the plane could provide visual information. The controls in the stricken aircraft would be locked out. The emergency pilots could land the plane at the nearest airport remotely. The chassis on the simulator could provide realistic movement in aiding the flying of the stricken plane.

&amp;#x200B;

Would such a system be possible and feasible? It would need to be designed in such a way that it can’t be disabled aboard the aircraft. If somebody with bad intentions could simply pull a circuit breaker, such a system would be useless. Is this possible? 

&amp;#x200B;

How would such a system be hardened against unauthorized use? It would be really bad to leave commercial aviation vulnerable to a system that could be compromised to allow planes to be taken over in flight by unauthorized personnel.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a second engineering question. Cirrus Aircraft equips it’s general aviation aircraft with a whole plane parachute system. If there is an in flight emergency the pilot pulls a lever. A rocket deploys a parachute and the entire plane floats to the ground with an impact of about 4g. Could such a system be scaled up to save a Boeing or Airbus aircraft? 

&amp;#x200B;

Boeing and Airbus aircraft are very heavy. Would it be possible to fit the wings, vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer with explosive bolts? This way a large amount of weight could be shed from the aircraft and the parachutes would only need to lower the fuselage. Could an airbag be fitted to the bottom of the fuselage to cushion the landing? Something that inflates like the emergency evacuation slides? Fire kills a lot of airplane passengers. A lot of fuel is stored in the wings. If the wings are jettisoned this would solve that problem. Some aircraft have internal fuel tanks. Is there a chemical that can be injected in the internal tanks to render the fuel non-flammable? Would it be better to jettison the fuel?

This might be a rather simple question to you guys but I can’t wrap my head around it.

I know that to calculate Thrust I need the mass flow rate of the water and the nozzle velocity, however when trying to calculate the nozzle velocity using Bernoulli’s Theorem, I did not understand which pressure to use for the fluid inside the pressure vessel. I will pressurise the air inside the container to around 40 PSI, would this be the the right pressure to use ?

Would anyone please mind talking me through it / tell what formula I could use to find the right pressure ? All online references I have found about this so far are not annotated very well and I do not understand the working behind them.

I'm having a bit of a problem with my summer internship and want some advice on how to proceed.


**Background**


I'm currently attending an internship sort of related to my programme ( bachelor+master in energy efficiency) were my job is to investigate the performance of different wind power estimation models (grid owner wants to know how much you produce so there is a balance in the electricity grid) for different wind parks were the focus is to identify the surrounding costs. Even though I don't have a strong statistics background I would say I've had a clue on what I should look into until now. I've done some basic regression analysis(basically a trend line in a scatter plot) to relate the costs to NMAE (Normalized mean absolute error, normalized with the parks max power) for each park and some other variables related to the costs. 

**Problem**

But now I feel that I'm stuck and not sure how to proceed. I've been thinking I could do some sort of confidence interval to see the likeliness for the NMAE to be in a certain range in the future for each model and then relate that to the different costs or something along the lines. I have also had an idea to do some sort of algorithm in Matlab that combines the different models some way (because they have different strengths) and thus reduces the NMAE for each park and thus the costs. An other thing I've been thinking about is a way to know when the estimation model is not behaving as it should. Like if it is in the 90-th percentile or something along those lines.




I really want to deliver some great results as I think this is a pretty nice place to work at as it is a large energy company, I could do my master thesis there and career wise is a great opportunity.

For Simplification i dont want to worry about tire deformation and slip ratios and so on. So the tire is essentially just a flat disc. 

As far as i understand it, the torque will push on the surface at the contact point with force *torque/radius*. Friction will counteract that force at the contact point and create a torque on the tire. That force will create a acceleration at the tire's center of gravity and the tire will move.

But wouldnt i now have a tire that moves but doesnt roll. Assuming infinit friction wouldnt that friction cancel out the torque and produce a net torque of 0, so no angular acceleration?

Engineering isn't my true passion, but I got the degree anyways because I was told I would have a better job/financial outlook and that I could always find a job in a different field since completing an engineering degree shows that you are capable of working hard.

So I have been thinking a lot about where I want to live and work after graduation.

I am also not really a big city person so I would prefer to stay as rural as possible (I know that's kinda hard with an EE degree). 

Ive lived in the Northern half of the East coast of the US for my whole life so I'm looking for a change from that. I think anything west of Texas would be really cool and maybe the mountainous areas of Tennessee and North Carolina. I like the western states a lot because of how much public land there is. I just don't really know what the job prospects look like in those areas. I'm not opposed to leaving the country but I'd prefer to stay domestic. 

I'm currently interning as a controls engineer in a manufacturing plant and so far I really like this type of work. I worked for a defense contractor last Summer but I found it be very slow. I like what I'm doing now so I think I want to stick with the manufacturing side of things. However, to me, the place I end up living is far more important than the job I have so I'd be willing to do about anything in the realm of EE. I think I have good qualifications and I don't think I will have too much trouble getting a job as long as there are some available.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the short story below but...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping you guys can possibly answer some of my many questions about engineering. I recently graduated school a year ago with no debt with an Economics degree. I am currently working at a small investment bank where my job is basically an over glorified salesman and all I do is clerical work. I hate my job and realized that I hate banking and the only reason I pushed so hard to break into it is because I was chasing money thinking I'd become a millionaire in no time (incredible folly on my part). Recently however, I've just been pursuing a somewhat newly developed passion of mine which is engineering, specifically electrical engineering. The reason this all happened is because one day I was sitting at work with nothing to do and looked at my computer and asked myself a very simple question. How does this computer work? And for the life of me I could not answer it! I could not come up with a simple explanation as to how this machine that I have grown up with my whole life works! So one thing led to another and I started reading up on computer hardware and software, how it gets its data, how wifi works, how radio technology works and I was just so fascinated because I was learning about how the world really works and how we as human beings mapped it out! I've since started reading some electrical engineering books trying to teach myself the fundamentals and basics. I'm tired of being an investment banker and feel like I'm not adding any value to society, and I'm tired of being surrounded by people who are so money driven and not curious about how things or the natural world works. I'm also tired of chasing money, especially when it doesn't bring me any happiness if I have to work in a field that involves long hours creating pitchbooks that go nowhere! I've made the slow transition on my way down the engineering road looking at certain schools and their cost of tuition, along with whether I should go for a masters or second bachelors. I believe that engineering might be a good fit for me since it's a field filled with people who love to build and create things and are always curious wondering how the f\*\*\* the darnest of things work. For reference the highest level of Math that I took is Calculus 2 which covered integration the whole class (took it because post graduation I was gunning for a MS in Financial Engineering, but dropped due to having a bad Calc 2 professor and work overtook my time, but funny how I was still pushing for a form of engineering even back in summer of 18 post graduation now that I think about it). 

My questions are:

1. Is there a difference between a Bachelor of Technology vs Bachelor of Science for EE? From what I gathered so far a BTech is much more common in India, and in the US a BTech only holds weight if it's ABET accredited. I also have gathered that it's much more practical degree than a BS where you learn much more theoretical engineering than hands on engineering.
2. Does the school you attend matter that much? I'm asking because in banking your school plays a huge role because banking is a very soft skilled industry where we again don't provide any physical value add. It's all about the network you have and who you can get meetings with, and the Ivy Leage Graduates = you can get meetings with people who have money. My understanding of STEM is that they don't care where you got your degree so long as you know your shit and can actually build and do the job. I'm looking to enroll into city tech (CUNY) because it's incredibly affordable and they offer a BTech in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications. For reference I graduated from Baruch college another CUNY and broke in because of luck (the CEO who pushed for me just liked my personality a lot) and persistence (had a good amount of internships)
3. Have any of you made a career transition into engineering from a different industry? Do you know of anyone? How has it been for you/them? 
4. Is there anything I can do/read that you would recommend? I'm currently reading Electrical Engineering 101 3rd Edition by Darren Ashby but feel like some of the concepts are going over my head and that I'm missing some parts of knowledge to the equation.

&amp;#x200B;

my pool has a 24V DC electrical roll to manage the floating cover. The roll is completely submerged.

After years of quiet operation, the roll's 7.5A fuse (inside a control box) broke a couple of times in 1 day, so I checked the current: whenever I move the roll, the Amps start at around 3 or 4 but then quickly climb up to over 10 (and I switch off manually).

Aside from this, the motor seems to be performing its job fine (ie it pulls and release the cover just fine). I checked the roll and there is nothing preventing it from rolling freely.

The pool technician told me I need to replace the motor, quoting me a scary price. The guy also inserted an expensive transformer in the quotation, which sounds a bit suspicious to me: why do we need to replace it if the problem is the motor and we know for a fact that it gets power?

So my question is: can the motor suddenly begin to pull in more Amps, while still working? Or can it be the transformer? Or is there any other possibility?

I’m kind of an intern at a smallish manufacturing company. That’s really not the right word for it but anyways, a very low ranking not-quite-finished-engineer. I’m working in the quality inspection department and I have a pretty good grasp of the routine operations I’m supposed to work on.

My foreman, a very nice dude by the way, asked me to look into improving the reports we provide customers regarding the products’ cylindricity. Now, the reports we have been making are pretty much produced by the default settings our measuring apparatus, a Rondcom 73a, spits out.

So I took a couple of hours to look at the report format and changed it to include relevant data. Easy peacy. But then I started to look at the finer settings and realized I didn’t really have a clue as to how cylindricity is really supposed to be measured. The old farts and my foreman seemed just as clueless.

Regarding the algorithm used, the default setting was LSC which I switched to MZC after reading [this short article]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875389212003604)

&gt;Among the four methods, only the MZC complies with ISO standards and has the minimum roundness error value.

I would very much like to hear opinions about the validity of this claim. Furthermore, thumb rules regarding filter settings would be greatly appreciated. Our machine runs some kind of JIS defined filter by default, with options to change to either a gaussian-, spline- or a robust spline filter. I do not, unfortunately, have access to ISO 16610 which seems to set standards for filter settings. I do, however, assume that the robust spline filter is the way to go, but are the default settings for elastic and robust coefficients okay? I have no clue what they do whatsoever. And then there is the question of setting the resolution, we have always used a default 50 UPR low pass filter which does not seem out of place when looking at the results, but are there any guiding principles on how to pick the resolution?

I do not believe anyone really gives a crap, our customers are, so far and have been for years, fine with reports that basically have a value for cylindricity and not much more. But god damn it if I'm going to do it I'd like to get it done right.

Also, I’m supposed to be working on some kind of SPC analysis for my thesis, says the boss man. I probably have a metric shitload of questions regarding that but I think I’ll save it for another day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/askengineers""&gt;r/askengineers&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

My question is, is a masters in mechanical engineering worth it? Is there any significant difference in pay or promotion time? I'm concerned that the extra stress of finishing my BS while taking grad classes, and then my extra year being more stressful than traditional grad students wouldn't be worth it.

The benefits are that I don&amp;#39;t have to take the GRE, I pay undergrad tuition for the first year, and get a master in one additional year of schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, is a masters in mechanical engineering worth it? Is there any significant difference in pay or promotion time? I&amp;#39;m concerned that the extra stress of finishing my BS while taking grad classes, and then my extra year being more stressful than traditional grad students wouldn&amp;#39;t be worth it. However, I feel that if I do not take this opportunity then I will regret it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What advice do you have? Would you mind saying whether you have a masters or not when answering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I just watched this video on an alternative to typical phase change closed loop AC units and did some more googling into typical swamp cooler designs, and figured I would like to build a slightly larger scale unit with a cooling capacity of a small window unit if possible. The image is what my current idea is.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea:**

The white boxes are ""evaporators"" all of similar design. For proof of concept I would probably just buy some box fans and have the [moist pads](https://www.google.com/search?q=swamp+cooler+pads&amp;tbm=isch) on the intake side and output side with a source of fluid entering on the top and a tub underneath to catch runoff. The ""dehumidifier"" is mostly identical except instead of water, it would use an aqueous solution of CaCl2. The now more aqueous runoff tub would fed into a solar heater, brought up to near boiling, then continue to an outdoor ""evaporator"" stage, which importantly increases the concentration of the CaCl2 desiccant material whist also removing the heat to return it to outdoor outside ambient temps. The fresh, cooled solution returns to the dehumidifier to absorb the moisture from the room. The air exiting this dehumidifier stage apparently picks up heat in the process so this hot, dry air goes through a number of air ducts outside to dissipate the heat and return it to outside ambient temperature, then finally fed to the intake of the evaporative cooler which cools the dry air as it picks up moisture. The video used an additional evaporative cooling stage for this instead which I'm sure would improve performance, although it also adds complexity and introduces more maintenance concerns along with more water usage.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions:**

I don't really understand thermodynamics, I was wondering if my fantasy would work. I do plan to build it up later on but I have concerns about the performance and maintenance an open system would present. Fungal/bacterial growths are an obvious issue so perhaps some bleach should be added to the water for the evaporator and closed system for the CaCl2. UVC germicidal lamps may also be a welcome addition although it would adversely impact COF. What are the equations and physics I need to be familiar with do determine if this would work? Especially regarding heat exchange and temperature differentials of this form of cooling? What temperature difference can be expected from a swamp cooler alone? How does it change based on humidity of incoming air? what humidity differences can be expected? I guess the dehumidifier stage will need to be overall larger to prevent saturating the air with humidity indoors. To measure the performance of a system I would need to be able to monitor water usage since that isn't necessarily free.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/GDSeOyg""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/GDSeOyg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m also pretty sure if I take extra courses while doing my PhD, I won’t have to take the equivalency exam (for example if I take a fluid dynamics course I won’t have to write the fluid dynamics equivalency exam etc.), so I’m thinking about taking a few extra undergraduate courses in my PhD (even though I have already finished my PhD course requirements) to reduce the amount of equivalency exams I’ll inevitably have to take.

Hello,

My friend recently took a non traditional academic route, and recommended I ask about this stuff on reddit, and after seeing the type of community, here I'm stoked.  I think some of ya'll might be able to give me some good advice.  Thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE:THIS POST BECAME LONGER THAN I PLANNED BECAUSE I GAVE SO MUCH PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND BITCHED SO MUCH, YOU CAN SKIP TO THE NEXT BOLD LINE FOR THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS**

&amp;#x200B;

I got a BS in Recording Arts (audio engineering), part of a notable music school at a big state university.  It was a 4 year program, learned a lot about some things, plus I learned a little about a lot of things. i received very relevant hands on experience.  I'd say it was more of a trade school type program, with ""applied science"" type electronics and physics classes (some of which were actually in the physics dept, but the classes were geared towards non-majors).  Several music classes as well, but that's irrelevant to this discussion. I feel like it was a overall good program and adequately prepared me for life after school in that field.

&amp;#x200B;

I also took a CS minor which was a subset of CS and math classes for undergrad CS majors, and did pretty well in the classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally academically successful and enjoy school, or at least I find it satisfying to be challenged and learn new stuff, even if it wasn't always fun.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked for a few years, mostly in live event corporate A/V production (but also some other type stuff..music, etc) and I think I'm ready for a change. I'm learning less and less each year and I'm getting less interested in the types of new things I am learning as I go on. The types of challenges I am facing are more in regards to people/management/logistics. I'd rather be faced with solving technical problems and challenges and creating new products/designs than winning and keeping clients, and pretending I am not bothered by unrealistic and constantly changing expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing how client-focused my industry is.  More important are appearances, making the client feel good, and getting through doomed production situations (trying to do too much with too little) rather than organizing and executing a complex tech heavy event, where everyone knows what to expect and competently does their job and has the information they need, and things go as planned. Even the high level productions (not that I've worked on many of those) are still crazy stressful and long days, and everyone's on edge. The days are either a clusterfuck, or they're really boring. And at the end of the gig, the only thing I have to show for it, is a paycheck and maybe a few new connections - generally no new knowledge of something I'm interested in, no satisfaction of having created something that didn't exist before. A good day is just one where I got paid decently and didn't work very hard, and for me, that sucks from a work-ethic standpoint. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus a lot of people I'm working around, don't seem to have the same interests as me.  I feel like I'm only reaching about 30% of my critical thinking capacity, but about 110% of my patience/socialness/dealing with people of different work backgrounds capacity. I can hang, I'm pretty easy to work with, I can diffuse high pressure situations, but goddamn do I find all that unpleasant and exhausting.  Some people don't mind it or even enjoy it, but I go home feeling so exhausted. I  don't hate what I'm doing now, and 20 year old me would probably think it's pretty cool , but I am almost 30, and I don't want to feel this way when I'm 40. I need an exit strategy, I feel like I have the capacity to learn and grow more in other fields. I'm learning hella people-skills currently, and a decent amount about business/directing money between and through various parties including myself, but I am not learning the technical/high level problem solving skills I want to be thinking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself most interested in fixing things, figuring out how things work, bringing my multi meter out to my car and fixing random electrical problems, opening stuff up on my electrical bench and seeing how it works, networking gear together, trying to break stuff, etc.  I'm much more interested in the nuts and bolts of technology, mostly electronics, but also software and mechanical stuff, than I am being an technician or some sort of middleman for live event productions.

  

In my CS classes we did Arduino and similar micro-controller based projects and I found it highly enjoyable.  I've had a hobby fixing vintage electronics/audio gear (hi fi systems/turntables, etc) I am a Linux enthusiast. I did a big theatrical automation project.  I really enjoy detailed planning, and frankly...somewhat solitary highly detailed work. I also really like learning new things.

&amp;#x200B;

**BELOW ARE THE QUESTIONS / THE MEAT OF THIS POST:**

&amp;#x200B;

I think what I would be most interested in going forward would be working on the design and development of audiovisual gear, especially implementing audio and video over IP technologies (Dante, AVB, etc), or working on D/A audio conversion chips (or integrating such chips into other circuitry).  Perhaps signal processing for audio and perhaps video, and that sort of thing. I am looking for the most efficient way to get this type of work - designing and implementing cutting edge technology into specialty equipment

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about getting either another BS in EE or CS, or a MS in one of these.  I think I'm leaning towards EE more specifically.  Most jobs postings which have seemed interesting seem to be looking for a BS or MS in CS or EE.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been researching some schools and I have found at least one (U of Chicago) which allows applicants from non science background to apply to their MS in CS program and finish in a year or two, and offer preresuiquite classes to help applicants from different backgrounds.  I am sure there are more graduate programs for non-engineers, but I am suspicious of how those programs can actually provide qualified graduates so quickly, with such seemingly low presiquite requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Other schools I've looked at (UCLA and USC) pretty clearly state all their graduate engineering programs are for students with a BS in a hard science. 

&amp;#x200B;

USC offers a 2nd BS degree option, but it looks like most of my classes (even gen Ed type classes) won't transfer and it would be another 3-4 years and a lot of money for another BS degree in EE.  However this MS program, looks right up my alley: [http://catalogue.usc.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=7781&amp;returnto=2401](http://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=7781&amp;returnto=2401)

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problem learning things in a traditional setting which will help me career wise and in later educational endeavors, however I don't want to spend time and money taking 100 level genEd's alongside 18 years olds just out of high school.  (I am almost 30). I am aware that I likely need catch up on math, I haven't even taken Calculus I other than a Coursera class I've been slowly working through between other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some advice on how I can efficiently become qualified for field I want to get into, mostly in a traditional academic setting, without wasting time or money doing things unrelated to my academic or career goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I generally can be a self-motivated learner, but I think it would take way longer to self-tech myself this stuff, and generally no one, especially recruiters, etc, would give a shit if I said ""hey I taught myself a lot from the internet and made these pet projects.""

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm just looking grad school info school by school, but it's taking a long time to look through the graduation requirements and prerequisite.  What I'm trying to do seems not super-common and I'm spending so much time digging through information.  Plus the schools I've asked questions to have not emailed me back.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any university recommendations that would be helpful to put in on a path towards my goals?  Any advice would be helpful.  Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend recently took a non traditional academic route, and recommended I ask about this stuff on reddit, and after seeing the type of community, here I&amp;#39;m stoked.  I think some of ya&amp;#39;ll might be able to give me some good advice.  Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:THIS POST BECAME LONGER THAN I PLANNED BECAUSE I GAVE SO MUCH PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND BITCHED SO MUCH, YOU CAN SKIP TO THE NEXT BOLD LINE FOR THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a BS in Recording Arts (audio engineering), part of a notable music school at a big state university.  It was a 4 year program, learned a lot about some things, plus I learned a little about a lot of things. i received very relevant hands on experience.  I&amp;#39;d say it was more of a trade school type program, with &amp;quot;applied science&amp;quot; type electronics and physics classes (some of which were actually in the physics dept, but the classes were geared towards non-majors).  Several music classes as well, but that&amp;#39;s irrelevant to this discussion. I feel like it was a overall good program and adequately prepared me for life after school in that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took a CS minor which was a subset of CS and math classes for undergrad CS majors, and did pretty well in the classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m generally academically successful and enjoy school, or at least I find it satisfying to be challenged and learn new stuff, even if it wasn&amp;#39;t always fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked for a few years, mostly in live event corporate A/V production (but also some other type stuff..music, etc) and I think I&amp;#39;m ready for a change. I&amp;#39;m learning less and less each year and I&amp;#39;m getting less interested in the types of new things I am learning as I go on. The types of challenges I am facing are more in regards to people/management/logistics. I&amp;#39;d rather be faced with solving technical problems and challenges and creating new products/designs than winning and keeping clients, and pretending I am not bothered by unrealistic and constantly changing expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m realizing how client-focused my industry is.  More important are appearances, making the client feel good, and getting through doomed production situations (trying to do too much with too little) rather than organizing and executing a complex tech heavy event, where everyone knows what to expect and competently does their job and has the information they need, and things go as planned. Even the high level productions (not that I&amp;#39;ve worked on many of those) are still crazy stressful and long days, and everyone&amp;#39;s on edge. The days are either a clusterfuck, or they&amp;#39;re really boring. And at the end of the gig, the only thing I have to show for it, is a paycheck and maybe a few new connections - generally no new knowledge of something I&amp;#39;m interested in, no satisfaction of having created something that didn&amp;#39;t exist before. A good day is just one where I got paid decently and didn&amp;#39;t work very hard, and for me, that sucks from a work-ethic standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus a lot of people I&amp;#39;m working around, don&amp;#39;t seem to have the same interests as me.  I feel like I&amp;#39;m only reaching about 30% of my critical thinking capacity, but about 110% of my patience/socialness/dealing with people of different work backgrounds capacity. I can hang, I&amp;#39;m pretty easy to work with, I can diffuse high pressure situations, but goddamn do I find all that unpleasant and exhausting.  Some people don&amp;#39;t mind it or even enjoy it, but I go home feeling so exhausted. I  don&amp;#39;t hate what I&amp;#39;m doing now, and 20 year old me would probably think it&amp;#39;s pretty cool , but I am almost 30, and I don&amp;#39;t want to feel this way when I&amp;#39;m 40. I need an exit strategy, I feel like I have the capacity to learn and grow more in other fields. I&amp;#39;m learning hella people-skills currently, and a decent amount about business/directing money between and through various parties including myself, but I am not learning the technical/high level problem solving skills I want to be thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself most interested in fixing things, figuring out how things work, bringing my multi meter out to my car and fixing random electrical problems, opening stuff up on my electrical bench and seeing how it works, networking gear together, trying to break stuff, etc.  I&amp;#39;m much more interested in the nuts and bolts of technology, mostly electronics, but also software and mechanical stuff, than I am being an technician or some sort of middleman for live event productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my CS classes we did Arduino and similar micro-controller based projects and I found it highly enjoyable.  I&amp;#39;ve had a hobby fixing vintage electronics/audio gear (hi fi systems/turntables, etc) I am a Linux enthusiast. I did a big theatrical automation project.  I really enjoy detailed planning, and frankly...somewhat solitary highly detailed work. I also really like learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm from the UK (North East) and have recently finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering, getting First Class Honours (approx a 3.7 - 4.0 GPA). Before the degree, I served my apprenticeship and spent 4 years working in a company which was primarily oil and gas (\~85%) but also featured defence and aerospace.

I'm hoping to keep the ball rolling and continue onto Masters, but I'm not sure which course would be the best to pursue.   
 

My original plan was to go back to oil and gas, obviously pays the best, and in the North East there isn't a lot of other options. I also wouldn't mind working offshore, on the rigs in the North Sea. The problem, since 2014 oil and gas has slowed and it seems like a dying trade, so I'm worried about doing a Masters in this area only for it to become redundant.

Aside from that, I would like to get into renewables, it certainly seems like the world is trending that way, but the UK market has slowed down due to a lack of government interest, and I there's a lack of opportunities for renewables in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Master Courses**

[Mechanical Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/mechanical-engineering-msc/#profile)

This is the safe bet, just more of the same, but I've got slight trepidation because I'm not specialising in any way. A bonus of the course is it covers vehicle drive, which could be particularly useful as there is a Nissan plant in the area, which is a huge employer locally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Offshore Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/offshore-engineering-msc/#profile)

This course obviously has a focus on oil and gas offshore platforms, but it also includes courses on marine systems to produce renewable energy. I'm strongly considering this course because of the included renewable modules; I feel that it might provide the best of both worlds, and leave me less at risk

&amp;#x200B;

[Pipeline Engineering Msc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/pipeline-engineering-msc-pgdip-pgcert/#profile)

This is a risky bet, purely pipline engineering for oil and gas industry. With oil and gas slowing down I would guess there's very little need for pipeline engineering, let alone a graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

[Subsea Engineering and Management MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/subsea-engineering-management-msc/#profile)

Again this seems a risky bet, as it is subsea in oil and gas. Again same risks as pipeline. Also the teaching of this course seems to be different from what I'm used to.

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: All courses are accredited by the Engineering Council and achieve the required educational requirements for Chartership*

&amp;#x200B;

**My Thoughts**

Currently, my head is a toss-up between Mechanical Engineering and Offshore Engineering. Mech is the safe bet and can't go wrong with the qualification. Offshore could potentially open doors to a lucrative industry without leaving me entirely at risk of being overly specialised in a (possibly) dying trade.

I included Pipeline and Subsea as they were the careers I planned on going into before the collapse, but since the market still hasn't recovered I think it's too risky. There's been a lot of layoffs in the north sea already, so even if new opportunities did open up I'd be bottom of the list with my lack of experience.

 

Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated. I'm trying to gauge what wiser heads think is the best path to take.

Oh and for the reusable bag, they use two rods to seal the bottom opening but according to the only Amazon review, that’ll only work for the first few times.

About me - my favourite classes dealt with FPGAs, Logic Design &amp; Hardware design and I was hoping to deal with that. Also, the majority of my core classes are 86 and up including those mentioned above.
 I have great soft-skills, including interpersonal ones. I have two job others where one I'm in the final round of interviews and one awaiting an offer.


#1 - Power Design Engineer 

This is at a large (1000+) people company that's growing incredibly quick and are the top 3 at what they do worldwide. My job description is basically analog circuits and op amps, DC-DC converters, and lots of lab work. The pay is double the average salary in this country and is what hardware engineers here usually make the first year out. The company also has digital design departments, and will probably expand into other fields as well.


#2- Application Engineer

Huge semiconductor company (~21 000 worldwide), doesn't manufacturer but has its hands in all the steps of fabrication. I'd be working alongside the algorithm and physics team and clients which are the fabs.  This job is extremely dynamic and doesn't involve me sitting in a lab all day, the pay would be more than the first job, but requires 30% travel time, but takes me away from hardware. This job comes with lots of prestige - my own office, bonuses during the year, business class flights to Asia etc. 


My dilemma:
My GPA - I'm scared I won't ever have opportunities like this again.  Both jobs are amazing and I feel confident about getting the offers. My problem is:

1.) Taking the HW design job and being stuck in power. While it seems interesting, digital and IC are where my heart is. 

2.) Taking the AE job and leaving hardware - I'm afraid it'll be super difficult to get back into the field of hardware if I decide to leave after a year or two.

I'd appreciate some input and some advice if any of you ever had similar dilemmas, as it's starting to cause some unhealthy amounts of stress thinking about it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some background - Finishing in around a month, sub 3 GPA (around 2.2-2.4 - personal reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

So about a year ago i graduated with a Bachelor's in ECET (Electronic and Computer Engineering Technology). My fiance was still going to University and refused (still does) to move far away from here, Central Arkansas. I was somewhat leaning towards PLC jobs as mostly there are manufacturing jobs here. I applied to a place as an electrical maintenance worker to just get some post-graduation experience and money. They offered me a supervisor position. Great! I thought, the position was suppose to be around 40-45 hours on average, 3 weeks of vacations, lots of holidays off.

It pays good around here, 55k (the company did say recently that a flat 4k raise to going to all salary employees soon and that they just reinstated COLA raises), and they set me up with a mentor for about 6 months and the last 6 months I have been over the smallest of the four plant's electrical team(which only consists of me and one ""electrician"") here. I just recently got a company cell phone, but was told i need to buy my own case. Also it has been months and I still do not have a multimeter (the electrician has his own, but he can't be here 24/7) despite being told they would get me one. I was also told today that I was expected to work about 50 hours per week, which breaking that down i would make less than my electrician per hour. 

There is hardly any programming to do here and most of it is just maintenance. I like the job when everything is running smooth because it is pretty chill and there is not much to do, but when something big breaks down the electrician, having less experience than I do, and I usually end up spending a while fixing it (stayed here 13+ hours a few times). I was told that i can come in late the next day if i have to stay late. Most projects seemed to be dropped in my lap and I am suppose to have a plan by the end of the day and it be completed before the end of the month (only day to install/test is on Sundays as the plant does not run and only maintenance is here). Also the mechanical supervisor or myself has to be here during the day. He works Sun-Thurs, so that left me with those days to pick my two off days. I have Sundays off (unless my electrician can't handle a project) to be with my SO as well as Monday. I was just told I need to work Monday as that is when the plant starts back up. I don't know which is worse, having split days or having two week days off.

So my questions are:
Am I in the wrong that I refuse to buy my own case for a company phone?

Is the time constraint on projects normal?

Should I look for another job or are the hours pretty much standard for the industry?

Sorry for the long post, just trying to get all the details down.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,

&lt;p&gt;It pays good around here, 55k (the company did say recently that a flat 4k raise to going to all salary employees soon and that they just reinstated COLA raises), and they set me up with a mentor for about 6 months and the last 6 months I have been over the smallest of the four plant&amp;#39;s electrical team(which only consists of me and one &amp;quot;electrician&amp;quot;) here. I just recently got a company cell phone, but was told i need to buy my own case. Also it has been months and I still do not have a multimeter (the electrician has his own, but he can&amp;#39;t be here 24/7) despite being told they would get me one. I was also told today that I was expected to work about 50 hours per week, which breaking that down i would make less than my electrician per hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is hardly any programming to do here and most of it is just maintenance. I like the job when everything is running smooth because it is pretty chill and there is not much to do, but when something big breaks down the electrician, having less experience than I do, and I usually end up spending a while fixing it (stayed here 13+ hours a few times). I was told that i can come in late the next day if i have to stay late. Most projects seemed to be dropped in my lap and I am suppose to have a plan by the end of the day and it be completed before the end of the month (only day to install/test is on Sundays as the plant does not run and only maintenance is here). Also the mechanical supervisor or myself has to be here during the day. He works Sun-Thurs, so that left me with those days to pick my two off days. I have Sundays off (unless my electrician can&amp;#39;t handle a project) to be with my SO as well as Monday. I was just told I need to work Monday as that is when the plant starts back up. I don&amp;#39;t know which is worse, having split days or having two week days off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my questions are:
Am I in the wrong that I refuse to buy my own case for a company phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the time constraint on projects normal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I look for another job or are the hours pretty much standard for the industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, just trying to get all the details down.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm gonna take the soldering iron to work and change the jack and nab myself a power supply for it and the hammers seem okay but I need just about everything else :)

I don't know what sizes I need but the bare minimum I want is;

* 4 cross screwdrivers, a ""regular"" sized one, a stumpy one, a small one and ones of those really long torque ones.
* 2 minus screwdrivers, a regular sized one, and a small one.
* a ratchet, I use a Bahco one at work and have no problems with it.
* wire strippers - i prefer the short more 'manual' ones
* wire snippers - small again just for electronics stuff most likely
* big pliers for bending stuff, small bent nose pliers for bending small stuff, tweezers are pretty cool too
* stuff to go with my soldering iron - solder, one of them pots to wipe away excess solder, a stand to put the hot soldering iron on, ill probably get by without flux or a solder sucker but they would be nice too.
* glue gun maybe
* probably other stuff too but off the top of my head i can't think of anything else

For the record I'm gonna get myself a PicKit soon too (which is part of the motivation to me sorting out my lack of tools) and I'm also running low on 3D printing filament, so any websites where I have to pay for delivery costs get bonus points if they do either of those things too.

I am currently doing petroleum engineering. And yes, I did look up API certs but it seems them for professionals i.e. graduates working in O&amp;G companies. Plus many certs related to O&amp;G seems to be given after employment. However. I do believe that the certs listed down below would still help me out etiher way in job/internship hunt.

The certs that I have been able to found out so far, would be awesome if you can also list them down, are as follows:

**CSWA** \- These solid works certs are so popular. Definitely gonna dig more into them.

**CSWP**

**CSWE**

**CSWP - S**

**CSWA - S**

**CATIA** \- Seems very pricey

**GD&amp;T** \- Is it only related to civil dudes?

**DFSS** \- Is this better than the belts?

**SAE** \- Any help to me?

**ASME** \- Is this better than OSHA?

**OSHA** \- Is this better than ASME? 

**LEED** \- Is it better than 6 sigmas and OSHA and ASME cert? or a bit different than them?

**LabVIEW** \- If good for me. When should I pursue this i.e. during undergraduate years or postgraduate?

**Pro/Engineer Wildfire -** Is this really needed for me?

**CDL -** (This one makes no sense but has such an important if one is doing petroleum engineering).

**ANSYS** \- How useful it is?

**6 SIGMA** \- White belt, Yellow belt, Green belt, Black belt. Which belt if the most useful?

**EXCEL** \- The advance one i.e. doing stress/strain calculations on it and etcetera. Making models

**MATLAB** 

**Programming Language** \- Any online reliable site that is recognized by the organizations. Any specific programming language preferred i.e. Python, R, etcetera

Now ofc, there are other certs like EIT, PE, and PF if I'm not wrong. But I'm not sure if they are worldwide, as I'm doing my undergraduate in Malaysia. 

I do know, many don't bother much, but I actually did some research regarding this matter on engineering students subreddit and certs were highly preferred there. So, now coming to the main point.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LabVIEW&lt;/strong&gt; - If good for me. When should I pursue this i.e. during undergraduate years or postgraduate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro/Engineer Wildfire -&lt;/strong&gt; Is this really needed for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDL -&lt;/strong&gt; (This one makes no sense but has such an important if one is doing petroleum engineering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANSYS&lt;/strong&gt; - How useful it is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 SIGMA&lt;/strong&gt; - White belt, Yellow belt, Green belt, Black belt. Which belt if the most useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCEL&lt;/strong&gt; - The advance one i.e. doing stress/strain calculations on it and etcetera. Making models&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATLAB&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming Language&lt;/strong&gt; - Any online reliable site that is recognized by the organizations. Any specific programming language preferred i.e. Python, R, etcetera&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now ofc, there are other certs like EIT, PE, and PF if I&amp;#39;m not wrong. But I&amp;#39;m not sure if they are worldwide, as I&amp;#39;m doing my undergraduate in Malaysia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do know, many don&amp;#39;t bother much, but I actually did some research regarding this matter on engineering students subreddit and certs were highly preferred there.

Now, our analysis group is pretty small and handles a lot of work. The lowest ranking employee is a Sr. ME I.

I'm currently working on a government R&amp;D team and have been encouraged by both my command and management to take the next step in my higher education. I currently have dual B.S.'s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from NC State. However, I now live in rural Maryland; thus, I will have to pursue an online M.S..

Both are completely online, with Hopkins having some in-person labs available (though not necessary for degree completion). I was accepted to both. Now I'm looking for any feedback regarding these programs. Here are some pros, cons, and courses for each:

Case Western Reserve University
Pros: Small class size (even online), professors and administration have been extremely helpful and communicative (a professor has already consulted a department to waive a requirement for a dynamics class), wide breadth of courses (i.e. dynamics, vibrations, digital controls, signal processing, power system analysis), technically rigorous (the admissions advisers recommend 15 hours of work outside of class/course), professors work as full-time professors, 6-7K cheaper than 
JHU
Cons: not as well known in Maryland/Eastern seaboard, in Cleveland, completely online, not as highly ranked as JHU, Systems and Control Engineering is an unusual (though not bad?) degree program, no thesis course (though research doesn't seem to be out of the question), few courses available

JHU EP:
Pros: Prestigious title, well-known in Maryland and across the U.S., application-focused, wide selection of courses, course material is something in which I have lots of background (ECE-centric), labs available for use
Cons: courses don't seem very challenging (for the Analog Electronics Design course your big project is characterizing a diode?!?!), professors aren't PhD.s/work as adjunct, my command is saturated with people attending Hopkins for master's degrees, the administration hasn't been very communicative at all in the application process (I've had to call them more than they've called me).

Hey y'all! I'm finishing up my Master's in Aerospace Engineering this Fall and thankfully the job search has been fruitful so far. (Changing company names for anonymity) I have five offers that I am seriously considering in five vastly different  specializations and locations. Weirdly they all are around the same pay but cost of living is quite different. I am just curious if I should be prioritizing how interesting the work is or if I should be focused on paying off my student debt (60K) as fast as possible with the best pay. The kicker here is my fiancee is a teacher who doesn't want to have to relocate a ton as she will have to jump through a bunch of hoops to re-certifiy so wherever I end up geographically I will most likely stay for 6-10 years. Here are the five offers so let me know what you think!




Offer 1: Defense Firm 

Job Title: Systems Engineer II

Location: Huntsville AL (lowest cost of living but Alabama isn't the best)

Pay: 93k

Work type: Kill vehicle design for ballistic missile defense. Cool stuff but not my absolute favorite. Apprehensive about starting my career at a big defense contractor.  Lots of AE jobs in Huntsville though and could jump around if needed. Newspace launcher (#5) is opening a factory in Huntsville in a few years. 🧐 Oh and I should mention I’ll be taking part in their rotational program here. 




Offer 2: Smaller Aerospace Manufacturing Firm

Job Title: Systems Development Engineer II

Location: Buffalo NY (super close to home but I hate snow)

Pay: 90k with straight overtime (hourly rate after 40hours/week)

Work type: Aircraft control system design. I have zero experience with aircraft and have no idea how I'll like it. The company had the best benefits but not much else in Buffalo to jump ship to. Live 10 minutes from my favorite football team. GO BILLS!




Offer 3: Newspace Startup

Job Title: Systems Engineer II

Location: Cape Canaveral FL (YAY BEACH. Hurricanes are a thing I guess.)

Pay: 90k

Work type: Satellite bus design for NASA and DARPA contracts. Company isn't super established (\~200 employees) and the benefits aren't amazing. The work is quite close to my “ideal job” though and the path to business dev and exec seem quite clear. I am interning here now so I know the work environment quite well. Other companies at the Cape to jump to. Definitely going to be working here part time in the Fall as well. 




Offer 4: Oldspace Developer

Job Title: Spacecraft Systems Engineer

Location: Phoenix AZ (I don't mind the heat all, almost prefer it. Teacher jobs are dreadful in AZ)

Pay: 96k

Work type: Nanosatellite design to support in-house tech demonstrations. Company is old school with good benefits. Work is what I have a ton of background in and the company made the Req specifically for me. Not a ton of diversity in Phoenix.




Offer 5: Newspace Launch Provider

Job Title: Advanced Concepts Systems Engineer

Location: Seattle WA

Pay: 97k

Work type: Lunar lander design (gee I wonder who this could be lol). I would absolutely love to work for this company based on their reputation and subject matter. However the pay/benefits aren't amazing and management seems to be on the fritz currently.

&lt;p&gt;Offer 2: Smaller Aerospace Manufacturing Firm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job Title: Systems Development Engineer II&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Buffalo NY (super close to home but I hate snow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: 90k with straight overtime (hourly rate after 40hours/week)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work type: Aircraft control system design. I have zero experience with aircraft and have no idea how I&amp;#39;ll like it. The company had the best benefits but not much else in Buffalo to jump ship to. Live 10 minutes from my favorite football team. GO BILLS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer 3: Newspace Startup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job Title: Systems Engineer II&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Cape Canaveral FL (YAY BEACH. Hurricanes are a thing I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: 90k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work type: Satellite bus design for NASA and DARPA contracts. Company isn&amp;#39;t super established (~200 employees) and the benefits aren&amp;#39;t amazing. The work is quite close to my “ideal job” though and the path to business dev and exec seem quite clear. I am interning here now so I know the work environment quite well. Other companies at the Cape to jump to. Definitely going to be working here part time in the Fall as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer 4: Oldspace Developer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job Title: Spacecraft Systems Engineer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Phoenix AZ (I don&amp;#39;t mind the heat all, almost prefer it. Teacher jobs are dreadful in AZ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: 96k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work type: Nanosatellite design to support in-house tech demonstrations. Company is old school with good benefits. Work is what I have a ton of background in and the company made the Req specifically for me. Not a ton of diversity in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer 5: Newspace Launch Provider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job Title: Advanced Concepts Systems Engineer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Seattle WA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: 97k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work type: Lunar lander design (gee I wonder who this could be lol). I would absolutely love to work for this company based on their reputation and subject matter. However the pay/benefits aren&amp;#39;t amazing and management seems to be on the fritz currently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for looking over all of this and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

I then ended up in a ""technical"" customer service position that was in no way technical, and moved to another that promised R&amp;D and failed to deliver.

Now, I also had the awkward realization in the last semester of college that I really, really like programming. I've kinda come to find that either pure programming or PLC/Controls are the closest thing I have to a passion, so I'd like to get into either of those fields. However, my resume is all about troubleshooting furnaces over the phone or placing repair orders. My actual *engineering* experience was two internships doing some Industrial engineering (5S, Value Stream Mapping, those sorts of things).

So I have a direction I would like to move, but it's been two years and what good technical knowledge I once had has atrophied, my resume is entirely off-topic, and for half the jobs I would consider I have the wrong degree entirely.

Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve been out of school for two years now with my expensive piece of paper that says I&amp;#39;m good at Mechanical Engineering. I then ended up in a &amp;quot;technical&amp;quot; customer service position that was in no way technical, and moved to another that promised R&amp;amp;D and failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I also had the awkward realization in the last semester of college that I really, really like programming. I&amp;#39;ve kinda come to find that either pure programming or PLC/Controls are the closest thing I have to a passion, so I&amp;#39;d like to get into either of those fields. However, my resume is all about troubleshooting furnaces over the phone or placing repair orders. My actual &lt;em&gt;engineering&lt;/em&gt; experience was two internships doing some Industrial engineering (5S, Value Stream Mapping, those sorts of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a direction I would like to move, but it&amp;#39;s been two years and what good technical knowledge I once had has atrophied, my resume is entirely off-topic, and for half the jobs I would consider I have the wrong degree entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't taken the oath yet.

However, after I submitted my Navy application, I also interviewed with NASA-JPL for an engineering position(just in case I didn't get the pilot slot). Luckily I survived the interview rounds and NASA wanted to give me an offer back in January but at the time the government shut down happened so they couldn't give me an offer. Fast forward to May, I got a Navy Pilot slot.

So here is the dilemma, I was happily prepping for Navy until NASA-JPL called me up offering me a very good engineering job with very good pay in Los Angeles. Basically a dream job for any engineer.

With NASA you get better work/life balance, live a decent social life and also earn a good salary. You can possibly live a happy family life and still have loads of fun at work.

With Navy Pilot, you get a more rewarding and challenging life. I plan on going to test pilot school and the possibility of even applying to become an astronaut in the future(I know that's some crazy dreams I got). I will lose the family connection and other social aspects compared to NASA. And also there is a chance that for some odd reason, I don't make it through flight training, I will be miserable for a couple of years with a different job at Navy. Let's just say, if I don't get to be a Pilot, there is a good chance I won't like it at the Navy. Also, I am quite old to be joining the Navy as a pilot. I will be 27 at OCS. The good thing is I am not married, at least for now.

In short  
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Nice steady life with great job satisfaction, build stuff and send to Mars  
US Navy Pilot - Risky and challenging life with very rewarding career opportunities, think Astronaut!

So I was hoping to get some thoughts on Navy Pilot vs NASA engineer. What is a more realistic feasible goal? What do current or past NASA engineers think of this and what would they have done. Is astronaut even a realistic goal?

I built a lift for my topper, and want to use a single cable to lift. I have a crank on the wall with cable. The topper is sitting on two pieces of strut I will actually lift.

Here’s the problem- If I fix the far end of the cable , it won’t lift evenly. The close corner lifts faster and out of balance. 
If I clamp the far end of the cable back to the cable running to crank, effectively running a loop through all the pulleys, the left side of the topper lifts faster. (And I run out of room before my cable clamps attach)

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of my back story:

I have worked my summers completing co-op terms related to my field; I did 14 months at Hatch Ltd. as a Linear Infrastructure Student. At Hatch, I mainly worked with the utility team where I produced detailed relocation designs of watermains, storm sewers, and sanitary sewers for a proposed subway tunnel, did tons of coordination  between subcontractors and stakeholders, produced and maintained conflict matrices and drawing registries, etc. Essentially, much of the work I did were tasks and jobs that a Civil EIT would do to support the team. I finished my work terms in good standing and was offered a full-time position with them after graduation. Currently, in my final summer before graduating, I decided to complete a work term in something I've never experienced before to get a feel of what I like and don't like; I am working at Turner Construction as a field co-op student. I see how DIFFERENT construction is from the consulting side at Hatch; I am managing submittals and shop drawings, assessing the conformance to contract specifications, and resolving any conflicts that do occur. It definitely is more fast paced.

&amp;#x200B;

From these experiences, I am slowly realizing that I don't find joy or passion in these positions. I am grateful truly for these opportunities but I am getting a little bit more scared each day that I may not want to pursue Civil Engineering upon graduation. I am not sure how else my civil engineering degree can be applied to job positions in Canada. I know I don't want to pursue a pathway in medicine or law; as for business, I have never been good with finance or accounting!

&amp;#x200B;

There really is a huge disconnect between what people in university *think* engineering is versus what it *actually* is. I am not sure how common it is to be on my boat. I know as an engineer I will probably live a comfortable middle class income and lifestyle. I know I will have a good financial situation than a lot of people but I wont be ""rich"". I want to be able to take the problem solving skills that I learned and apply them to a different field to become ""wealthy"" or at least upper middle class.

For this reason, I hope it would be okay to ask a few questions to the general Reddit community. Here they are:

1. What is the hiring process like (i.e. After application is there a phone interview, then an in person interview, then the offer assuming one gets there?)
2. What kind of questions are asked in phone/in person interviews or rather what can one expect here?
3. What can I do to prepare for these kinds of interviews?
4. Assuming I am mainly applying to be a manufacturing engineer or production support engineer at entry level, what kind of salary should I expect and can I negotiate? (I understand this depends on cost of living but what is considered livable in places like Huntsville, Saint Louis, Seattle, San Diego, Boulder, etc.?)
5. How long does the entire application process take?
6. Finally, how often do people change companies?

Have you heard of Hyperloop?**

&amp;#x200B;

In an [interview with New Civil Engineer](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/hyperloop-network-could-replace-heathrow-third-runway-expert-claims-12-04-2019/) in the UK - the managing director of Hyperloop One claimed connecting the three major airports around London (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) could solve capacity issues.

The theory essentially is that you connect all three airports (in this example) together by rail. A secure rail way, probably underground, would carry passengers from airport to airport - airside. So in theory, you would check in at the airport closest to you, say Heathrow, and go through security, get your baggage sorted etc. Then you'd jump on a high-speed Hyperloop train which would take you to Stansted the other side of the city, and you'd be in a small terminal ready to board your flight. 

Each of the individual 'carriages' on the railway would be secure (i.e it can only stop at the stations it's programmed to stop at, and people cannot get off until that departure is reached). The argument from Hyperloop one is that this makes huge terminal buildings with massive check-in and baggage drops irrelevant.

The MD of Hyperloop even went as far as to say you could have remote check-ins, say in the heart of the city, where you check you and your baggage into the hyperloop train system and it takes you directly airside.

**I'd be interested to see what engineers think of this - is this too 'futurologist' a view, or does it have legs? Maybe it's an extremity which if dialled back a bit could have valuable input into the future of Airports - or is it just a pipe dream?**

It can be hard to understand something we can't see, so I thought what if I could demonstrate different levels of radioactivity by bringing those radioactive particles into the visible spectrum.

This is the question I had in mind - ""If you were standing in a room with a 100W light bulb and the photons were replaced with radioactive decay particles, how much radiation would you be exposed to""

You could also compare it by equivalent energy because the energy of the particles is much higher than visible light. So you could either go for the same number of photons, or the same amount of energy.

I would vote for total power though. A 100W incandescent bulb is only ~5% efficient, so that would be 5 Joules per second.

In Chernobyl, [a firefighter picked up a chunk of graphite]( youtube.com/watch?v=qqZpjRxUZwA) (which would be carbon-14 beta decay) that was the equivalent of 4 million chest x-rays, which by the shows math (3.6 Roentgen = 400 xrays) would be 36000 Roentgen *per hour*. Wikipedia says one roentgen deposits 0.0096 Gy (0.96 rad) in soft tissue. A Grey (Gy) is defined as 1 joule of radiation absorbed per Kg, so the graphite chunk in the firefighters hand would be emitting 345.6 Joules of absorbable radiation per hour. So compared to a 5% efficient incandescent bulb, that would be a ~0.1W bulb. But thats just the amount of radiation absorbed, i'm sure it is emitting much more that is not absorbed.

Anyway, thats as far as i've gotten. I would like to make a YouTube video on this and i want to get it right. Im sure there are some inaccuracies, but is this an accurate representation? I also want to compare different radioactive materials. like showing how it would only take a very tiny amount of Plutonium-241 to equal the decay rate of U-235.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched the Chernobyl TV series with my family and my mom and brother seemed to have a hard time understanding how radiation works, and thought the show was overstating its effects.&lt;/p&gt;

Civil graduates tell me structural engineering has an oversupply of inexperienced graduates since 75% of civils want to be structural engineers. Which means no jobs and low pay. And structural design work can be outsourced overseas, only requiring 1 local engineer to sign-off the final design.

&amp;#x200B;

My lecturer told me civil (geotechnical) has the best job prospects because very few graduates want to do geotech. Not many applicants for geotech roles means more likely to get a job, and geotech is unlikely to be outsourced. But is there a secret reason why very few graduates want to do geotech (e.g. dirty, too much field work, long hours, boring)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the job prospects for entry-level mechanical engineers compared to civil/structural engineers in Australia?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like mechanical is limited to mining and HVAC in Australia, since Australia doesn&amp;#39;t make anything anymore. Mining is very cyclical because it&amp;#39;s tied to Asia&amp;#39;s economic growth.

I tried to start it again (it's a pull start) and after a few pulls, it ran. However, every time I throttled above \~50% it would die again.

**Suspicion:** I noticed the same behaviour once already. Back then, it was caused by condensed water collecting in the fuel tank over a longer period of time, which was sucked into the carburetor bowl. So I suspected water might have gotten somewhere it shouldn't.

**Solution:** Since I had to get back fast and didn't have the tool I needed with me (obviously...), I decided to improvise. Pulled the choke all the way, and gave it a few pulls, then throttled it up to \~60% in neutral, closed the choke and pulled it a few times. After that it ran. Even afterwards, it worked and I didn't have any issues since.


So now my question is: The first time (water issue), it obviously pulled water from the fuel line into the carburetor bowl, which tricked the floater to think there was sufficient fuel when there really wasn't. I emptied the carburetor bowl and it worked fine after that.

However, this time, the only thing that I can imagine happened is the motor sucking air instead of fuel because of the boat jumping but I really don't see how air in the carburetor bowl would cause any issues? It would just be pulled out on the first few pulls and the motor would work normally afterwards, right?

So, can air cause any issue here I don't know of or does anyone have any idea what might have happened?

To understand what i mean by ""looking for some guidance"" I have to give some backstory first:

I have recently finished my Bachelors degree in industrial engineering with some extra classes in control theory and measurement technology (dont know if this is the right term) and started an internship in a large electronics company focused on automation since i really loved electrical engineering classes in university.  Initially I applied for the internship to learn more about control theory and its applications but i was handed different tasks that I had no clue about (e.g. network engineering, programming and so on). At first i was really overwhelmed and didnt know what to do since I have never touched anything like that in university. The first few weeks were really hard and i felt really really dumb ... but after some time i got the hang of it and learned a **LOT** in these few months that i have been working there.

But now comes the part where i need ""some guidance"". Im constantly thinking about the fact that IE might not be the right major for me and if i should switch majors to EE since my internship is really interesting and fun at the moment. However, if i would switch majors i would have to start from scratch and would have to move to another university as well since mine does not offer EE as a major yet (this is one major part that is holding me off since i really love my current university).

I have talked about this with my father a lot as well who has a degree in automation engineering. He told me that a good engineer needs to have some basic knowledge about the economic aspects as well and that i should keep doing my masters in IE (especially if i want to climb the ranks in the later stages of my career). We then agreed that i could do some extra classes that are not mandatory for this major (i already did some of theses in my during my bachelors studies like i have mentioned in the beginning). We have looked for some available courses in my university that i could take during my masters degree which seemed promising like signal theory, nonlinear control theory, radar and laser technology and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

However, im still not sure if this is a great idea or if i made the right decisions and thats why i have these questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Has anyone in this sub ever been in this kind of situation?

\- Are extra courses a good alternative to switching majors?

\- Has there been a case where some knowledge in economics or accounting would have been useful in your work as an engineer?

I have a solid fuel pit that needs to be cleared annually. The fuel is RDF. The pit is located within a building. This is because the grab that moves the fuel can't reach the lowest 200mm, nor can it reach into the corners or close to the walls. This fuel can rot over time and create odours which the Environmental Agency don't like. 

The pit is 6.4m high from ground level, and 2.3m deep. So a total height of 8.7m inside the pit. 
The walls are 450mm thick reinforced concrete. 

There is an overhead crane that operates a grab during normal operation. There is space to set down to grab and lift a bobcat into the bunker to aid in the clearing. 
The works in the pit can be observed from the crane walkways (while the crane is locked out)

However I am uncertain of a solution of how to get a man into the pit, with a relatively fast and easy way of getting him out again. Because of the height of the walls and the material in the pit it will be confined space, and gas monitoring will be required, potentially even breathing apparatus.

*Edit: currently there is an opening in the side for construction. This could be made as a removable section if I can find a way to make it water tight and strong*

Either temporary or permanent solutions are viable. 

The current ideas I have are below. But any others are welcome:
*Edit: A. A water tight removable section in the side wall*

B. Bring in a temporary crane and man cage.

C. Descent from overhead crane gantry - but no easy egress. Maybe something similar to a window cleaning platform?

D. A specialised boom lift

That brings me to question 1 - what is the safest way to melt thermoplastics for personal use in molds, etc? Is there anyway I could melt the plastics, without using a liquid (water bath), without causing them to emit fumes?

Further, HDPE has the best qualities of all the plastics I've read up on - it's durable, weather &amp; bug resistant, and it's least likely to emit toxic fumes when remelted. 

That brings me to question 2 - Is there some way I could chemically alter the other plastics to become HDPE? Maybe the easiest plastic to convert, judging by names alone, would be LDPE (maybe by melting it and adding a catalyst).

Agree or disagree and why?

I've had my P.Eng. for over 10 years. Now as in Project Management role where the vast majority of people in my position aren't Engineers you might say I don't need. Heck just cancel the membership. Nothing could be further from the truth. Because perception is reality, I would still say for personal branding alone, and the fact that we're coordinating with other licensed Engineers on our project teams on-going, that it's still much better to have.

Ok lets say you're not even working with other P.Eng. on your projects like a typical Software Engineer. People will say I don't need it for my job, it's all about skills, people around me including higher ups don't have it, and there's some truth about that, but really how do they define what you need? If it's about being employed then you don't need anything but relationships including a degree, MBA, LEED AP, PMP, P.Eng., Eng.L. Heck even high school is enough since everything can be learned on the job if you think about it. I would say if you think about it in terms of the long game, any Engineer including Software Engineers should get it because of:

1. Personal branding. Nobody around you has it is actually the reason why you should get it more so then not to set you apart. Your next internal Senior Software Engineering or Management position you apply for with 20 applicants and you're the only licensed Professional Engineer. I mean come on. This is a big part of why why I was hired to Project Manage that doesn't technically require it over other equal experienced applicants as I found out after I was hired when talking to my higher ups.
2. Personal and professional milestone met.
3. P.Eng. is a license to legally practice Engineering in your province. Being licensed to practiced as a professional does open doors directly or indirectly when it's not obvious. Even when I applied for non-engineering leadership positions, I later hear back we liked your application, hiring a experienced P.Eng. is something we like. That even surprised me because all the other Managers in the firm aren't P.Eng. When all things are equal, anything to set you apart helps.
4. Engineering entrepreneur: Lets say down the road you want to use your own skills from Engineering and run your own gig as a say a Sole Practitioner. Then you really need to being a licensed Professional Engineer for yourself and the clients. Sure everything has a work around like you could hire a P.Eng. and manage them and you still can but there's reasons why most Managing Partners in Engineering firms are P.Eng. members for credibility among other reasons.
5. Public Sector Engineer: Lets say down the road you want to join the public sector. Yes it's a factor they do usually as for this on the job description and in any case it's a big plus. These jobs are usually competitive and a P.Eng. can set you apart.
6. Fees: I've worked for a lot of firms and they all paid for my Engineering membership fees. Even in roles where I don't need to be. I would think it would speak to the legitimacy of the firm if they wouldn't even do that. Now my currently firm is technically not an Engineering firm but it's still professional development firm and they still pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student currently interning for an aerospace company that has some federal contracts. While I realize that marijuana is illegal due to federal regulation (even though I'm in a legal state), I wanted to hear people's experiences with post-employment drug testing i.e. likelihood of a random test while employed even after passing a pre-employment drug test. The city that I'm in actually prohibits random testing, but I'm assuming that's nullified by the government regulations, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mostly asking because marijuana really helps me with my back pain and, ideally, I could use it on days it's very bad (once or twice a week). I'm currently clean, but I work with software/electronics and not heavy machinery and don't anticipate much of a risk for an accident.

**The system**
In the back of the van, the bed platforms run between supports on the left and right side of the van. Each of the two platforms are 30"" wide and 72"" long (making something close to a queen size bed when both are installed). The supports on each side support about 1"" of the end of the each platform (the whole 30"" width). The supports are able to be moved, so that the two bed platforms can be rearranged into a couch instead of a bed. The bed platforms should be as thin as possible to maintain cargo space below them. They should also be as light as possible so that one person can move them around to transition from bed to couch and back to bed. 

**The current solution**
My first crack at this was to laminate 1"" pink XPS foam in between two 5mm sheets of plywood (0.2""). In the sandwich I also inserted 1/4""x3"" aluminum bar at either end to distribute the 1"" supported over 3"". After the sandwich was laminated with gorilla glue I attached two aluminum 1""x1"" square tubes (with .0625 walls) to the bottom from end to end. I glued them, and also put 1/4-20 bolts through the aluminum tubes and the sandwich. The goal was the prevent the aluminum from any shear motion relative to the sandwich. 

This works pretty well. The whole thing is pretty light (I think lighter than a sheet of 3/4"" plywood, and there is almost no deflection when using the system as a bed. The issue is when in couch mode and you have two adults sitting in the middle of the 70"" span. There is noticeable deflection, and the platform is starting to take a permanent curve (the not-great part of using aluminum). 

**My idea**
I think the general idea is good, I just want to do it better. I have some experience with fiberglass, and have some materials on hand. I am interested in using the same 1"" foam core, and using fiberglass/carbon fiber to make a composite laminate. Since most of the tension will be on the bottom of the platform, I am considering using carbon fiber on the bottom, and use fiberglass on the top. Amazon has some cloth with the following specs:
Weight - 6.2 oz/sqyd 
Weave Style - 2 x 2 twill 
Thickness - .009"" 
Count (W x F) - 13.1 x 13.3 
Fiber - 3K   
To make it stronger, I was thinking I could cut some 1""x1"" pieces of foam and glue them to bottom of platforms, so that when I cover them with carbon fiber I would get a bit of corrugation. 

**Questions I have**
* Does anyone have any gut feelings (or way to calculate) how many layers of carbon fiber I would need on the bottom of the platforms?
* Do people think I should still reinforce the ends of the platform with anything other than fiberglass/carbon fiber (because only a 1"" will be supported"")? 
* Any other ideas on how to make a very strong and very lightweight platform that is 72"" long and can support two adults sitting in the middle of that span (other than buying some crazy honeycomb layup)?

In the sandwich I also inserted 1/4&amp;quot;x3&amp;quot; aluminum bar at either end to distribute the 1&amp;quot; supported over 3&amp;quot;. After the sandwich was laminated with gorilla glue I attached two aluminum 1&amp;quot;x1&amp;quot; square tubes (with .0625 walls) to the bottom from end to end. I glued them, and also put 1/4-20 bolts through the aluminum tubes and the sandwich. The goal was the prevent the aluminum from any shear motion relative to the sandwich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works pretty well. The whole thing is pretty light (I think lighter than a sheet of 3/4&amp;quot; plywood, and there is almost no deflection when using the system as a bed. The issue is when in couch mode and you have two adults sitting in the middle of the 70&amp;quot; span. There is noticeable deflection, and the platform is starting to take a permanent curve (the not-great part of using aluminum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My idea&lt;/strong&gt;
I think the general idea is good, I just want to do it better. I have some experience with fiberglass, and have some materials on hand. I am interested in using the same 1&amp;quot; foam core, and using fiberglass/carbon fiber to make a composite laminate. Since most of the tension will be on the bottom of the platform, I am considering using carbon fiber on the bottom, and use fiberglass on the top. Amazon has some cloth with the following specs:
Weight - 6.2 oz/sqyd 
Weave Style - 2 x 2 twill 
Thickness - .009&amp;quot; 
Count (W x F) - 13.1 x 13.3 
Fiber - 3K&lt;br/&gt;
To make it stronger, I was thinking I could cut some 1&amp;quot;x1&amp;quot; pieces of foam and glue them to bottom of platforms, so that when I cover them with carbon fiber I would get a bit of corrugation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions I have&lt;/strong&gt;
* Does anyone have any gut feelings (or way to calculate) how many layers of carbon fiber I would need on the bottom of the platforms?
* Do people think I should still reinforce the ends of the platform with anything other than fiberglass/carbon fiber (because only a 1&amp;quot; will be supported&amp;quot;)? 
* Any other ideas on how to make a very strong and very lightweight platform that is 72&amp;quot; long and can support two adults sitting in the middle of that span (other than buying some crazy honeycomb layup)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks you!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated with a bachelors in EE and will complete a one year masters degree focused on ML, IoT, and AI in Spring 2020, all at a top 10 American Engineering school. I expect to graduate with around a 3.5 GPA for my Master's program. I am going through with the Masters because I only have 5 classes left and I am actually genuinely interested in the stuff I'll be learning. However, I am not sure I will enjoy working as an engineer. This Summer, I am doing embedded software engineering working with satellites (an objectively cool job that I should be super excited about).

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line is I am not happy working as an engineer. All the other interns I sit with wear headphones all day, only taking them off during lunch and meetings. The long days of writing code are draining for me. I enjoy the meetings and talking about what I did and what I am going to do more than I enjoy the work itself. During my first week at this internship, my boss told me that soon enough, I'd have all my software set up and I could ""just get to coding all day."" The fact that I was supposed to like this made me realize that maybe I should consider doing something besides engineering after college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to work with people and always imagined I'd be an engineer for a year or two and naturally transition to a business role. However, now I'm thinking I might as well start in something where I work with people a lot more. For background, I'm above average at engineering, its just that I've never really loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I am considering:

1. Management Consulting... something tech related?? -- not sure what prospects are like for someone straight out of a Master's program. I don't think I'd wanna be in the same recruiting class as a bunch of recent bachelor's degree grads. I'm going to have debt from my Master's and I don't want that to be for nothing. What sorts of jobs can an engineer get in consulting right after a Master's degree? 
2. Working at a start up-- I was thinking that maybe working at a small company I could transition into a business role much quicker. I was thinking engineering manager, product manager, or anything that requires technical and soft skills. The only thing that scares me with this is possibly getting stuck in engineering. 
3. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I'm a computer engineering Master's degree grad looking for a more people-focused job. I like technology and think that my Summer project is really interesting. I could probably tough it out and be an engineer for a year or so, but think that I need to work with people all day to be happy in the long term. I plan on getting an MBA and I'm going to start studying for the GMAT this next school year.

My whole family is from the USSR, both sides moved here in the late 1980s. I was born in the U.S. in 1999, hold no Russian citizenship, but I visited Russia once (for 10 days in 2010) and speak/read/write fluent Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coworker mentioned this would be a possible deal-breaker in the aerospace industry, which is pretty unfortunate, given my major and interests. I thought it would only be a plus - I have no allegiance to Russia (only the food tbh) and my knowledge of the language would help with defense companies. My father used to work for two major American defense contractors and held a secret clearance when I was a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR is my Russian heritage a barrier? Do I have a chance of being hired by a major company in the aerospace industry like Lockheed or Raytheon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Спасиб&lt;/del&gt;...  err, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently pursuing a mechanical engineering degree ( 2nd year out of 5). This summer I decided not to take summer classes and take it easy since I haven't had leisure time in a very long time. I finished high school, then went straight to CEGEP ( 2 mandatory years related to your university field after completing grade 11 here in Québec) then straight to uni where I switched majors ( electrical engineering to mechanical engineering)

Long story short, i needed a break and thats what I'm doing now. But, i feel kind of bad not doing anything in all that free time I have.

What I thought of is maybe acquiring some skills that I can learn on my own. I have had programming classes ( C++) but I didnt learn much. I also suck at AutoCad &amp; SolidWorks. I'm looking to learn something during my free time but not sure what. 

I came on here mainly to get some input from 
- engineers ( mainly mechanical?) on skills they would've wished they'd learn before landing their job. 
- skills employers are seeking in recent graduates
- recent mechanical engineering graduates and current students that can give me any advice on what to do/learn. 

Any advice on  books, youtube channels, websites or tools I should refer to are also very welcomed !

&amp;#x200B;

I'm \*not\* an engineer, but I'm prototyping an idea and wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of a component for an airflow system which is comprised of two tubes.

My intent is that as air is sucked through tube 1, airflow would be created in tube 2, flowing in the opposite direction.

The air tubes are around 0.5 inches in diameter and what I'm imagining is a fan in tube 1 turning clockwise as air is sucked through it, with the turning of that fan causing another fan to rotate in tube 2, creating airflow in the opposite direction.

Does such a component exist? Any advice would be brilliant!

I also heard that many of the interns projects just end up being thrown outside after their gone and I do not want that to happen to mine! Thanks for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone, I'm a 22 year old male, currently working full time and recently I have figured out that I want to pursue Coding/Programming as a career. So I am here looking for some advice on where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background of what got me to decide on what I wanted to do as a career... So, I graduated High School in 2015 with not having an idea of what career to pursue. Fast Forward through a few factory jobs, and in 2017, I started working as a Team Lead for a manufacturing assembly line, and at the beginning of that job I was able to have build a close friendship with a few Control Engineers while they worked with setting up a Human Machine Interface (HMI), which at the time the facility had just recently opened so they started basically from scratch. As time passed, I found myself always hanging out with them when I had a chance. I became so fascinated and interested with their work that I slowly started considering it as a career.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present time, I'm still at the same facility, but as a Torque Technician. I am now for sure that I want to  pursue that career, and although I can't afford to go to College right now,  I would like to get some advice as far as what Degree would be best to consider once I am ready. I've heard of a few such as Electrical, Computer, Mechanical, Software Engineering, or Computer Science. I would also like some advice on what type of job I should look into that will help me get some of the experience necessary and start preparing myself for it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

I am new to reddit, so, don't know much about it but I will post my questions anyways.

I am a recent graduate of BE-Mechanical. I have an interview for the position of Design/Research Engineer (aerospace industry).

I want to ask how should I introduce myself, I mean whether I should focus more on the designing side of my experience in undergraduate years or should I give a general introduction of my skills and experience, what is the best approach?

Secondly, Is it ok to mention my freelancing experience?

Highlights of my resume:

1. CGPA: 3.81 &amp; NUST graduate (#1 Engineering institute in Pakistan)
2. Final Year project on renewable energy (Designing of Waste to Energy Power Plant)
3. 1 extensive research based course project on, ""Multi-Generation System""
4. 2 Internships (1 in power plant and 1 in fertilizer group)
5. One year Undergraduate research experience (with 2 projects on design and simulation of a drone and an aircraft)
6. 8 months of freelancing experience (with around design and simulation of 7 projects)
7. 1 online course on renewable Energy, ""Our Energy Future by University of California San Diego""
8. 3 international memberships
9. 2-3 Competitions winner and part of organization committee (including one international competition)
10. Software skills include expertise in Solidworks and Ansys (from designing point of view). Also in EES, Cycle Tempo, Matlab, MS office
11. Community Service award for volunteer work

&amp;#x200B;

p.s: It would be a great help if you can help me prioritize the order to which I should talk about theses experiences.Also if you had the hiring authority which experience will attract you the most. Any guideline will be a great help for me to stand out.

I had this thought today (for the 100th time) and wondered what those of you who interview potential hires might have to say.

There are certain fundamentals questions that I ask most candidates. Some of these I considered removing because it seems almost insulting to ask a 10-15 year engineer to answer such ""basic"" questions. Except that they routinely get them wrong, even with a decent amount of handholding. So I keep them in.

I don't like to ask questions that require memorization of formulas that most engineers wouldn't be able to remember anyway. I do like to ask questions that test whether you have a basic ""intuition"" or understanding of engineering principles.

What kind of questions? EDIT: Scratching the following til I can post the questions since evidently these descriptions are enough to assume the world. Which, incidentally, is a negative thing in an interview. ~~Things like...you have 2 identical dams holding back water. Water level is the same, the dams are the same in all respects, except one dam is situated 1 meter away from a solid wall with water in between. The other dam has an infinite ocean of water behind it. Which experiences more force? Of course, the force depends on pressure and area. Area is the same, so you're left with water: density, gravity, and height. They are also the same. Maybe 10% of candidates get this right on the first try. It should be a 15 second question, but it often takes 5 minutes to talk them through the process of figuring it out.~~

~~There is another that involves knowing that - due to it's moment of inertia - a cylinder rolling down a slope will take longer to reach the bottom than a frictionless block of the same mass sliding down the same slope. And again...very few candidates realize that on their own without prodding from me.~~

They could be poorly worded questions, but even after it is clarified repeatedly and strong hints are given, many fail to see the connection. Or maybe I'm a terrible interviewer! Hence this post: have any of you experienced this sort of thing, and what are the common stumbling blocks for both new and seasoned engineers that you didn't expect?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Figured I'd update to clarify a few things:

1. I promise they are less confusing on the actual test, there is different wording as well as to-scale diagrams of each situation. Even so, I've taken some of the comments to heart and I will reword these so they aren't ""gotcha"" questions.
2. These aren't the only questions (or types of questions asked). These make up maybe 5% of the interview. The OP question was specifically about ""seemingly simple"" questions. Design and detailed technical questions aren't seemingly simple IMO. The rest are either technical or practical, relating to both the job and the candidate's resume. If they list DSP or EE work on a resume for instance, I'll add a few of those types of questions, quantity and complexity determined by how much of their resume those skillsets occupy.
3. There is a wide range of questions, and I don't expect any candidate to nail everything. I'm looking for strengths and weaknesses; getting these wrong does not automatically DQ someone. I'm more impressed by a wrong answer followed by methodically considering the factors and winding around to the right answer, than an immediate correct answer followed by silence.
4. To those of you saying you'd walk out of the interview: fair enough, but I will add that some of the worst hires I've seen were those with seemingly impressive technical backgrounds and portfolios. The types of people whose ""work just speaks for itself"" so we didn't harp on the technical stuff too much. On-site they either don't bother putting in the work, or took forever on straightforward projects while making poor decisions along the way. Anecdotal obviously but it is what it is.
5. I agree that these are only vaguely relevant to day-to-day work. That said, I believe that if you have solid engineering fundamentals you should be able to reason your way (or at least take a shot) to something that seems like a decent solution. These questions are not an example of that, obviously, but there are other questions there that are more open ended. For example, a design problem for a thing I am pretty sure the person has never seen. In plenty of jobs you can get by without great fundamentals, and most engineers do, but there are often stumbling blocks that slow down projects that could be eliminated by understanding what's really going on in a system. It happens now and then.
6. The cylinder question is different from the one in OP. I don't want to post the actual question and diagram because I'm paranoid a coworker will recognize it. There are no frictionless blocks involved, I thought that'd help clarify in the OP but I think I'm mistaken here.
7. A note on ""real world"" considerations. There are some questions that are specifically probing to see if they consider real world issues. If I ask you to design a system to transport a mass from A to B 100 million times, I want someone to actually consider what a system built for high cycle-life looks like. Design questions, part selection questions, etc.  On the other hand there is a particular type of candidate (and I am one of them sometimes FWIW) that tends to read way too far into literally every question. For instance (this isn't an interview question): How much force does a 1kg weight exert on the ground? It should be obvious that the question is asking what m\*g is. If someone starts saying ""well, which ground? On Earth? Because gravity is different on the moon. Which part of the Earth? Planet Earth isn't actually spherical but an oblate spheroid, and the gravity depends on local variations in the distance to the COG, plus the density of the crust and mantle in this part of the world. Is it windy? Wind could affect the force. What's the density of the object, because buoyancy will reduce the force."" Yeah, I might be impressed that you thought about all that, but less impressed that you can't get out of your own way enough to see the forest for the trees. I would wonder if you are overly pedantic about everything and whether you can focus on a problem instead of spending most of your time going off on tangents.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: As promised, here are the questions in...question. Curious if this changes anyone's mind that these are trick questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I also added another ""fundamentals"" type question to see if you all have any thoughts on that. I'll be honest...I *love* this question. Almost nobody gets it right on the first try, but that's not the point. I prefer to talk through it with people to figure out how they're approaching the problem, where the flaw in their reasoning might be, and why the answer is different from what it seems. To make it abundantly clear: **getting this wrong at first is not a knock against a candidate.** OTOH failing to understand any of what's going on even after talking through it, giving hints, asking leading questions, **is.** The worst answer is ""I don't know"" followed by silence, which is exceedingly rare.

Unlike the other two, you can't make any argument that this is useless trivia - this is *directly relevant* to designing bolted connections, which most engineers don't understand too well despite designing them all the time. An example of why ""having done it a bunch"" is not always the same as ""knows what's going on,"" and lack of the latter can and has led to many real-world problems. It's a question that I consider both heavy on fundamentals, and extremely applicable to the job. Would love your thoughts.

A 12-inch softball weighs between 6.25 and 7 ounces. For batting, I want it to toss the ball 50 feet (slow-pitch). For fly balls, I want it to throw up to 250 feet.  By my calculations that means 27mph for 50 feet and 60mph for fly balls.

I'm thinking of building a sled system with one spring on each side, then a ball holder in the middle. How much force will be on those springs for each speed (i.e. how much torque will the motor require)?

&amp;#x200B;

Does someone have a diagram to show a mechanism that would pull back the sled, then release it? Phase 2 would be to have a sensor detect when a ball was in place to launch it, then add a remote start/stop controller.

My first design was going to use a piston mechanism to convert a rotating motor to linear force, but my calculations showed this was going to take a 1000rpm motor and a 15-inch diameter wheel. I didn't think I could find a motor that could provide enough torque from a dead start to do this. Since to conserve battery (thinking 12V), I don't want a continuously running motor, just when a ball is in place. The sled system would avoid this issue.

&lt;p&gt;Now it is all online with over 600+ student&amp;#39;s, the lectures changed to videos, about 20 min each total 6x for the whole course and a 4-6 hours of &amp;quot; guest lecturer video&amp;quot; which is basically ppl from local companies spending half the lecture time marketing their company to students and discussing very specific details that make their company seem like it&amp;#39;s A+++ company ( super high tech safety, good quality). And they do not go into any technical details ( related to actual engineering). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is now Purley online quiz based, report and final exam . It&amp;#39;s all multiple choice questions, and they seem more about can you memories what was said/shown instead of &amp;quot; think about it, what&amp;#39;s more logical&amp;quot;. Its nothing more then a memory class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend more time at school at our engineering space making/designing 3d printed stuff, electronics, making a resistance welder and basically dicking around with the principles taught in lectures and applying them to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were hiring an engineer who said this, would this be a good or bad attitude/behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

My house is affected by the recent Mississippi River flooding. It is an interesting construction, being built into the side of a hill. The lowest level is the garage, which sits in front of the the basement. The basement floor is 1 foot higher than the garage floor. During the ""Great Flood of '93,"" we built a steel door to place over the doorway between the garage and the basement, which share a common concrete wall (all of the basement and garage walls are concrete). The door was meant to be watertight, but it leaked and we had to build a sandbag well in the garage outside the door to pump out water so that it wouldn't enter the basement. Now, we've had the ""No-So-Great Flood of '19"" which was a few feet lower than '93. We put the door in place and tried to seal it using pool noodles as a gasket, but it still leaked. The water crest at 1' high in the garage and was just hitting the lip of the floor in the basement (whoo!). I want to make the door truly watertight so that I don't have to worry about a sump pump with it. The door is incredibly heavy and currently has to be pushed into place by 2 strong adults. I'm thinking of adding hinges to it so that it can swing into place or wheels to the bottom so at least it can be rolled into place by 1 person. The door is pulled tight against the concrete wall by nuts on threaded rods that pass through the steel and attach to steel beams inside the basement, thus sandwiching the concrete wall between the beams and the door. What can I use to create a watertight seal.

Here are pictures of the door in place:  [https://s.put.re/hbWRfij1.jpg](https://s.put.re/hbWRfij1.jpg) [https://s.put.re/bZBcLtgX.jpg](https://s.put.re/bZBcLtgX.jpg) You can see the green pool noodles being squeeze out the sides on the outside image. They are squeezed internally the same amount.

&amp;#x200B;

I am two years removed from obtaining my BSEE (power focus). It was not easy for me by any means, and I graduated with a low GPA. Since graduating, I have worked as an electrical design engineer in the power industry (substation design).  I enjoy it and value the experience I'm getting, but I've always known that I did not want to be in a technical role my entire career; a c-suite position with an engineering-focused company has always been the ultimate goal.  I want to be more focused on the business side rather than tinkering with schematics and electrical diagrams. However, I don't want to be in the finance industry or something like that.  I want to remain in the engineering realm but making business decisions. As of now I do NOT have aspirations of starting my own company. These things considered, I feel that an MBA would be a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

My company will pay for a fair portion of my MBA.  I would go part time for about 2.5 years, and it would cost me a total of $10k out of pocket (good ROI in my opinion).  At that point, I'd have about 5 years of experience and an MBA (potentially also my P.E.; I will probably pursue it within the next 2 years but am unsure if it is a waste of time if I the goal is to get into the business side).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my low GPA, my MBA options are limited, and I am currently considering SNHU (yes, the university that does all the cheesy commercials).  I was skeptical at first, but they are fully accredited and have good reviews from past students.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd greatly appreciate some feedback from other engineers who have insight into this.

&amp;#x200B;

First, does the name of the school matter in a situation like this? Would an MBA from SNHU to be used in the engineering field be scoffed at?

&amp;#x200B;

Second, what concentration would you recommend? Finance? Business Intelligence? Engineering management? Marketing? I'm very torn on this.  I know engineering management sounds perfect, but I'd be concerned that it would lock me into being a technical engineering manager, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.  SNHU describes that program as the following:

&amp;#x200B;

""The Engineering Management concentration will focus on integrating systems thinking concepts and systems engineering practices to develop effective engineering management strategies. Students will gain the knowledge to make informed and successful business decisions that foster improved efficiency, performance, and effectiveness in highly technical engineering environments.""

&amp;#x200B;

Third, would obtaining my P.E. be overkill? All technical managers in my company are required to have it, as signing off on electrical documents is something that is required. That being said, I understand that not all engineering careers would require this. I don't expect passing the P.E. exam would be easy for me considering obtaining my BSEE was no cake-walk. If it'd add no value to me climbing the corporate ladder, I'd consider not pursuing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, is there a recommended career path? Design Engineer&gt;&gt;Project Management&gt;&gt;Manager of PMs&gt;&gt;Potential C-Suite? Design Engineer&gt;&gt;Engineering Supervisor (PE required)&gt;&gt;Engineering Management&gt;&gt;Potential C-Suite? Should sales engineering be thrown in there somewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I'm asking a great deal in the preceding, but I have so many questions going through my head and really no one to turn to for guidance on this exact matter, as an MBA is not popular in my company (but I feel it could open many more doors for me).

I learned that lowering downstream electrical noise will improve low light performance and dynamic range more than anything else. From a technical perspective, a camera with a high base ISO is superior. The problem is not everyone wants to use optical ND filters (on sensor or on lens) to fix the issue of too much light. Many photographers, especially still ones, think larger recording areas always mean less noise because the fluctuations are not magnified as much. For film, that's true. For digital, larger sensors alone don't affect noise. It's mostly about electrical design.

&amp;#x200B;

With current cameras, you must make a choice between a focal plane shutter, a leaf shutter, or a rolling electronic shutter. These all create problems when trying to use a wide aperture, a flash, and a broad daylight environment. Leaf shutters enable faster flash sync and expose the whole frame. The problems with leaf shutter lenses include higher weight, complexity, price, and less freedom for optical corrections. With focal plane shutters, the shutter does not expose the whole frame at once. With HSS flash sync, it lowers the flash power and raises the burden on the batteries. This is because shorter low power bursts are used to mimic continuous light. Rolling electronic shutters have similar problems.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Organic CMOS sensor idea from Panasonic, I read that the gain can be adjusted to produce step free ND filter characteristics without the optical ND filters. Ideally, I would want the sensor to have a high base ISO (like 800 or higher) and have ND filter like characteristics to enable more light to hit it when you want a low ISO like 100. This way, the sensor can have an ISO of 100 or 800 or anything in between all while having equal image quality when exposed properly (for example: get 16 stops of dynamic range at ISO 100 or 800). Is this technically feasible? I know with Panasonic cinema cameras, exposing for 100 will cause clipping in many circumstances while many cameras start at ISO 100 and won't clip as fast.

&amp;#x200B;

To enable fast flash sync speed without HSS or leaf shutters, my idea to have the whole sensor start and stop the photon collection process at the exact same time. This is to enable only one burst for flash at a shutter speed of 1/8000.

&amp;#x200B;

Other ideas include a hardware based hot pixel detector. If the sensor detects no electrical response at a pixel while everywhere else has electrical response, the response for that pixel stops and is flagged for removal when exposure is over. Unlike the dark frame reference, this happens during the exposure meant to capture and record the image and eliminates the need for dark frame reference.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have analog gamma compression and possibly the option for analog logarithmic compression too. Both will improve dynamic range. Gamma compression rewards over exposure if you don't clip the highlights; it's great when brighter regions are the subject. Logarithmic will be available for when you want to compress highlights and improve mid tones and shadows.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been googling for about 2 hours and am not this good at math.

Little backstory: My family has a small island and cottage in northern Ontario. It's remote enough that we can't reasonably count on any fire department help, and the soil is dry/sandy enough that fire can travel very easily underground. We are very careful with any open flames, but still use a fireplace for heat, and bbq to cook, and burning down the entire island is not something we want to do. Our current water supply is just an on demand pump straight out of the lake. It's fine for showers and washing dishes but not enough pressure that I want to try and put out a fire with it.

I've been looking at getting a second hand IBC container to use as an emergency water tower, but I'm not sure it would be worth it. The cottage itself is about 50ft below the highest point on the island, and I wasn't really planning to build any actual tower, just put the container up there, and keep it full. I found some decommissioned 3"" fire hose for about $1/ft that I'd hook up to the 1000L IBC.

My rough math tells me I'd get a little over 20psi, but I can't figure out how that actually translates to water flow out of a 3"" hose.

So I’m building this hoist to lift and store my topper. You can see the hole where I have one more pulley at the top of the wall above handcrank. I’m planning on putting strut in the ceiling above the crank and spreading it across four trusses. 

It will lift it but it seems like it’s way too tough. I’m not sure if my pulleys aren’t working or angles are to harsh, or what. 

A few things that I think it might be, trying to narrow it down. 

Vinyl coated cable, when it wraps around the crank it slips in between the cable already on the spool. Should I go just bare cable?

Angles aren’t right. 

Pulleys aren’t pulling at the same time, causes more friction?

Hoping you can assist to let me know the current state of this structure.  I have been told (not by engineers) that it is ok however i'd like to ask for some expert input as to whether or not the 'wear-away?' is ok and easily patched or a structural hazard.

&amp;#x200B;

Some photos are for context, there are obvious ones like the balcony cracks that I am concerned indicate a complete breaking off at some point.

I would very much appreciate someone's input.

I respectfully ask that you please don't ask for details on address etc for further clarification of other inputs - although i am not overly concerned about keeping this confidential as i feel the photos need to show the exact situation which takes precedence, i would however prefer this to be private so do not want to provide more info (aside from more pics if needed).

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some photos are for context, there are obvious ones like the balcony cracks that I am concerned indicate a complete breaking off at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would very much appreciate someone&amp;#39;s input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respectfully ask that you please don&amp;#39;t ask for details on address etc for further clarification of other inputs - although i am not overly concerned about keeping this confidential as i feel the photos need to show the exact situation which takes precedence, i would however prefer this to be private so do not want to provide more info (aside from more pics if needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: please also see last image in imgur that im concerned about - not sure what the deterioration indicates but could this be widespread?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Everyone!

Some background on me: I graduated in 2014 with a BSEE from a reputable 4 year university. I then worked for about 1.5 years as a technical sales supporter for a sensor manufacturer helping the sales team with technical questions and coordinating things between engineering and production. Following that I thought about going to medical school so started working in the medical field for \~2.5 years while taking all the Bio and Chem related classes. After deciding that I was mental for thinking about medical school, I returned to engineering.

I am currently working as a project leader for a manufacturing plant. I've been here about a month, but dread coming into work every day as the position is more of a maintenance position. I do not design anything just more of issue purchase orders, call vendors, and put work orders in. That is if there is anything to do at all, otherwise I spend my time staring at the wall.

I am going to stick with the position for a little while as I need to have the experience back in the field and am grateful to even have found someone who would hire me after the break from engineering.

My Question:

I want to move towards a more design oriented role, but have no prior work experience in such a role. I really enjoyed creating, designing and just generally doing more engineering related work while in school. All the job postings I see in the area have the typically 3-5 years experiences.

What are somethings that I could be doing to help better position myself to change industries to something more design related? or any general advise as to how to move roles as it feels rather hopeless. I do not want to pigeon hole myself more then I have with my jumping around in careers.

I am however planning on doing a Masters part time with a focus in signals, embedded systems, and circuits in the near future.

Thanks for the help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a stupid idea that is not here to be rated on merit, but reviewed to see it is possible.

A portable gun, large, rifle shaped, single shot. A projectile is breech-loaded into the back of the barrel and then a quarter stick of dynamite is loaded in behind it. The dynamite is detonated through means inconsequential to this experiment.

Here's what i know

1) the power of the explosion is based on a lot of things, but mostly the mass of the charge. 

2) different combustibles combust at different speeds - the charge in a pistol cartridge explodes 'faster' than that of a rifle cartridge.

3) longer barrels are more efficient because the explosion has more time to push the bullet before escaping out the end, but, 

4) logically there has to be a point where this benefit is cancelled out by drag. 

5) the chamber has to survive the detonation over and over; more energy means a thicker chamber, which brings a lot of negative qualities to the firearm.

I have been having no luck finding a resource to compare the per-mass energy of various combustibles or their combustion speeds, so I have been unable to compare dynamite to smokeless powder in these respects.

NOTE: the diameter of the bullet is that of the dynamite. Big slug! So! 

1) would it work? Could this be a thing someone could carry around and use? 

2) obviously, if the benefits of this weapon outweighed the benefits of a conventional rifle we'd be using it, so this in no way is supposed to be a 'better' gun, but what advantages WOULD it have? 

3) would it be better to have the rifling in the barrel or on the slug

4) assuming that the required weight and length of thr item are acceptable, how 'powerful' could this thing be?

I was wondering what the correct (or generally accepted) word for 'read-out' time is. I'll give two examples to illustrate:

&amp;#x200B;

1. For a read-out based on infrared spectroscopy, the read-out time would be the total time for spectrum collection (typically a couply seconds), processing by the computer, and display of the result. So total read-out time would be a couple of seconds.
2. For a read-out based on electrochemistry, in which a sample is (manually) taken from a bioreactor, inserted into a cuvette, and the cuvette inserted into the electrochemical device, total read-out time is in the order of minutes.

Hi everyone! I (25F) am running into a problem at the company I currently work for and have been with since I graduated with my Bachelor's 3 years ago. I work on Long Island (NY) as a water supply engineer and do a ton of design work/permitting/construction inspection for all things related to clean water. I am involved in the process of a project from start to finish. For someone with only 3 years of experience, I do a lot more than what is expected of an ""entry level"" engineer, as do most of my other coworkers who are around the same age/years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. My company does an annual performance review in which they go over your performance from the past year and offer you a cash bonus/salary increase for the upcoming year. From all of the research I have done using different resources (Glassdoor, [Salary.com](https://Salary.com), BLS, NYS Civil Service, etc.), I am underpaid for someone with my experience level. I am currently paid \~$62,750/yr (but I am paid for each hour worked over a 40 hr work week), and received a raise just today up to \~$66,750. My research shows that I should be paid AT LEAST \~$75K (I can provide links if you think it is necessary).

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Is my research for the NYC/Long Island area totally wrong or can someone provide me resources that show I'm wrong? My employer is claiming they have done research that shows I am paid at market value for my current level of experience, but literally everything I have researched has shown otherwise. I appreciate any and all help/advice that anyone can offer! Please let me know if I forgot to provide any critical information that could help.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told that including 3D renderings of my drawings might get in trouble with intellectual property issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides drawing random stuff on my own, what can i include in my portfolio? Some of the designs I did have won awards, but then how can I prove/show that i did those, especially before in-person interview?&lt;/p&gt;

I know there are various posts like this throughout the sub...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my current employer for the past 5 years, and up until around a year and a half ago I loved it. But over the course of the past year and a bit our department has gone through some significant changes, and as such I have began to really hate having to turn up to work. I've only ever worked with my current employer so don't really have a significant insight into usual industry attitude and practices... 

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer have the opportunity to learn when working on projects, everything is rushed and I am missing significant details because I do not have the time to review properly and ensure I understand them. This means I'm taking continual knocks to my confidence, to the point where I'm worried about doing anything without someone else checking it...Which seems to be a significant struggle in itself. I know that I am capable when it comes to my job, but it's becoming ever more difficult to show it. I'm also expected to carry out tasks which are far above my remit, which I don't mind doing, but I receive no support from management while doing so. Very much a not my problem type attitude from them.

It's important to me that the amount of gas in the network is conserved and correct, as its a resource in the game, but the other variables are less important.

My knowledge of this is pretty basic so far. I understand that PV=nRT but I'm having trouble with understanding a valve and the behavior of choked flow through that valve. I will eventually need partial pressures too, and thats important, but to start with I'm ok with a single gas. My system does not have to be very accurate (its fine with ideal gas, laminar flow, and crude approximate behavior in general). I'm ignoring pressure loss in pipes and stuff like that.

I would really, really appreciate it if someone would kick off a discussion around this, so I can improve my understanding and work towards a solution!

This [PDF link](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~david/courses/cs552/S12/handouts/ecc-phelps.pdf) gives a good overview of details for a 4 bit actual data word + 4 bits of parity/checkbit generation for a total of 8 bits.

I understand the overall concept of Hamming codes and generating the parity/checkbits.  The syndrome calculation should tell you which *exact bit* out of the entire 8 bits of data+parity is bad for a single error. 

What I can't follow though is the syndrome calculation for telling which bit is bad and the one you want to ""flip"" to correct.  On page 6, he has a matrix and the following lines for example:

    flip[3] = ~synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp;  synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp;  synd[0]
    flip[3] =  synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp; ~synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp;  synd[0]

    flip[3] =  synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp;  synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp; ~synd[0]

I don't get it.  How can you assign multiple calcs like this to the same bit flip[3]?  How is this math here derived?  Similar for the other flip bits.


EDIT: actually, I think the author may have typos. The flip[*] bits should be going down the matrix as flip[0], flip[1], flip[2],..., flip[7]??

Made a throwaway for this post. I’m completely on the fence regarding a recent job offer I recently received from a large defense contractor for a Systems Engineer position. I currently work as a NASA contractor as a flight controller for ISS. I’m 25 y/o and I’m currently in my first job out of undergrad. I have a Bachelors of aerospace engineering and I’m currently pursuing a Masters in Unmanned Aerospace Systems. 

Ideally, I would like to soon obtain a job with NASA either as an aerospace engineer or robotics engineer or operator. My dream is to one day become an astronaut. I’m making arrangements to gain my private pilot’s license (PPL) and after that, I am thinking to pursue Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve to gain significant flight hours. 

I’ve gone back and forth a million times trying to decide. My current job is as a console operator, and the offer is for an engineering position, which is what I’ve studied for. Each selection has its perks; the pros for each job are listed below. However, one of my main questions is whether it would be more valuable to diversify my career and gain actual engineering experience or stay with NASA (as a contractor), which is ultimately where I want to be, in a civil servant position (I think?), though my current job is not technically engineering. Salary, and some benefit info will be included below. I must note that my contractor raised my salary a couple months ago after I received other job offers; I accepted my current company’s counter. The current offer under consideration is significantly better than anything I received earlier. I’m also curious whether it would look bad to go back to my current company and inform them of this offer to see if they could up my current salary or tuition assistance. Any input/advice is much appreciated. 

**Current Job:** 

· I really like the work; my passion is space exploration. Future space missions, such as the Artemis program, are things I very much want to be involved in. 

· I know the culture and I know it is a good place to work, whereas I do not really know the culture of the potential job I’ve been offered. 

· I have a lot of flexibility – time off, telework, etc., but this comes with the cost of having to work all 3 shifts at times. However, this flexibility could allow me to pursue other interests, such as PPL, with relative ease. 

· I’m good at what I do. I’ve moved up the ranks relatively quickly and I could see myself continuing to move up into higher level lead positions, including (potentially) civil servant positions within the next few years. 

**Potential Job:** 

· The job sounds very interesting. The leads for this particular team sound very intelligent and willing to pass along knowledge. 

· Actual engineering experience, though it is systems engineering. 

· \~15% base salary increase over my current salary.

· \~4x tuition assistance offered compared to my current company’s tuition assistance policy. 

· \~double the company 401k contributions compared to my current company.

-Is resistant to scratches, general rough handling, water, the odd splash of oil, being dropped etc.
-Is fairly cheap (&amp;gt;100 NZD to cover a part the size of a shoebox)
-Is available in NZ
-doesn&amp;#39;t take forever to prep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if it were available in: dark green, CAT yellow, tan, maroon, teal, battleship grey, or similar. Would also tolerate other colours if it&amp;#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;

 This is all well and good, but I can't help missing being one of the ""smart kids"". I often see many engineering students who can't make it in engineering switch to business, and worry that I'm seen as a lower-tier student.
In addition to this, as I look at potential careers or internships, many jobs will say they are looking for ""finance or other quantitative majors"", usually including engineering. I understand why many companies specify this, as they would prefer to hire a ""smarter"" person irregardless of background.

I've been mulling over a switch to majoring in engineering, even though it would mean adding at least a year to my degree and essentially throwing out everything I've done to this point.

Hello, I hope this is the right sub to post this in. Anyways, a little back story:

I got my BSME back in Spring 2017, didn't have any internships. Got my first engineering job a year after college. I was told the position would be a blend of mechanical and operations engineering, but it actually involved almost no engineering. Didn't get to use CAD or any math, had only minor involvement with the operations of the company, only really dealt with OSHA and DOT paperwork. I was let go after being there for almost 9 months when the company relocated my job to a different state and decided not to move me.

I've had multiple phone interviews and a few in-person interviews since then, got turned down for all of them. Several of them were at companies that various college friends currently work for and they were nice enough to recommend me for the positions. I'm pretty sure I was turned down due to my lack of relevant work experience.

I feel trapped. The only way to get more work experience is to get a job, but I need more work experience to get a job. I'm currently trying to get some certifications through self study (Inventor Certified User, GD&amp;T, FEA) but other than that I don't really see anything I can do to show that I am trying to gain relevant experience.

Are there any other career options I may not have looked at that I could use as a foot-in-the-door that would lead to an ME position later on? Also, if anyone has any other advice, I would really appreciate it. Trying to stay positive but it's been a few months and I am starting to lose hope.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I hope this is the right sub to post this in.

I'm currently a year 12 student in Australia and am having a difficult time with deciding on what I want to study at university next year.

I really love the environment, I love being outside and not always being stuck behind a computer sitting at a desk. In my career I would really love to be out in the field a lot doing work. With that being said though, I'm also one of your classic 'maths nerds' and was one of the top maths students in the state last year.

My interest in being out doing a lot of work in the field has drawn me to the Bachelor of Science (majoring in ecology), but my strength in maths has drawn me to doing a Bachelor of Environmental Engineering. The other option is that I do a double degree, doing both.

I'm worried that if I do engineering, its going to be too much just sitting at a desk doing 'maths stuff' throughout my degree and future career. However, I'm also worried if I do the science degree (going by some of the research I've done), the pay/opportunities is far less than if you did engineering.

Are there any engineering jobs that deal with high temperature fluid flows that are relatively immune from electrification?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi reddit, I have been working in a company that develops offshore wind projects for the last year and a half or so. Until now, my role has been of a junior engineer (first full-time job since graduating from university with an Aerospace Engineering degree). The scope of this position has been very vague and I have ended becoming an assistant to whatever department needed more manpower, may it be procurement, finance, programme, business development... For a while I have been looking for something more specific to actually get the chance to really get some structure in my day-to-day.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago, I was approached by somebody in the Wind Yield (WY) department (they optimise wind turbine layouts, estimate production of projects, site data gathering and data analysis campaigns,etc.) offering me a position in their team. At first I was very keen for this position and I got in contact with HR for the transfer. When I let my current manager know of this he told me that he thought this position would be a wasted opportunity for me. He offered me an alternative to wait until september when numerous other less technical ""contract management"" positions are opening up and then basically get my pick of the department I was most interested to join (wind turbines, offshore structures, cables,etc.) as a project engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldn't take his advice as gospel as he obviously doesn't want to lose somebody in his headcount, but he did raise some valid points. He told me that the WY team just churns out the numbers requested by the rest of the project team, don't have the ability to question many design choices, and that career progression would be more limited. It is also a very niche department and chances of transferring out of that department within the company are limited. These arguments may seem overly pessimistic but I do agree with them to some extent from my experience so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very torn between the two options because I think I would do really well and enjoy the day-to-day in the WY position as I am a numbers guy and really enjoy complex calculations in MATLAB and Excel, and I would love to become an expert in something. However, I also really enjoy the contract negotiations and management side of things as I am good at public speaking, I like to be involved in the daily struggles of a project, and like to have a view on a wide range of topics and not feel isolated simply doing calculations.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been given 2 weeks to make a decision and until the deadline I plan on speaking to as many different people in my company for advice. I know that ultimately this has to be my decision but I would like if anyone here on reddit has had similar experiences and can share any insight to help me make the best choice.

About 2 years and 30 pounds ago, I decided to take my health and fitness seriously. Since then I have gone through a lot of trial and tribulation, learning a lot about myself through my journey. I still have ways to go (probably another 15-20 pounds before getting to a lean, 10% body fat physique), but I am happy with the progress I have made.  


The reason for this post is I’m currently trying to find out how I could make the lives of busy Engineers (such as myself) who are looking to transform their body into a fitter and healthier version.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why I have two very simple questions:

1. As a busy Engineer looking to get fit, what are the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with?

2. Regarding your fitness journey, what would you wish for more than anything else?

https://youtu.be/5x3PUb4fgls

There are already natural gas generators, so really the main aspect for this to work is to figure out how to prepare the methane for use in the generator, especially since the methane is not isolated but mixed in with the surrounding air. Doing some online research I came up with some potential ways of going about this, they are as follows:

Capture the methane and oxygen, compress, and possibly be able to use this for combustion being mixed. According to wikipedia: As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at standard pressure.

According to wikipedia methane is soluble in a number of liquids, one of which is ethanol. Run the air/methane through ethanol, once fully dissolved, then either extract it, or possibly use it in this liquid form in a generator.

Cooled on location to turn into LNG.

Pumping methane and air into a separate above chamber, perhaps a pyramid shaped structure. Allowing the methane to concentrate in one area, then intermittently sucking it out into another chamber. So while it will not be pure methane, it will be concentrated enough to be used in a natural gas generator.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/5x3PUb4fgls""&gt;https://youtu.be/5x3PUb4fgls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already natural gas generators, so really the main aspect for this to work is to figure out how to prepare the methane for use in the generator, especially since the methane is not isolated but mixed in with the surrounding air. Doing some online research I came up with some potential ways of going about this, they are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capture the methane and oxygen, compress, and possibly be able to use this for combustion being mixed. According to wikipedia: As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at standard pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to wikipedia methane is soluble in a number of liquids, one of which is ethanol. Run the air/methane through ethanol, once fully dissolved, then either extract it, or possibly use it in this liquid form in a generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooled on location to turn into LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pumping methane and air into a separate above chamber, perhaps a pyramid shaped structure. Allowing the methane to concentrate in one area, then intermittently sucking it out into another chamber. So while it will not be pure methane, it will be concentrated enough to be used in a natural gas generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time, if you have any ideas that you think could help further develop this concept, please share.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a degree in Psychology and well, I am willing to change my career paths. It is nice to help people but I am starting to feel more like a 'butler' than an innovator. I think that studying engineering will help me be more of an innovator. The only reason I did not pursue a hardcore STEM first time around is because of my personal fuck-ups. I have made bad to mediocre decisions. So, bit by bit, I am willing to knuckle down and do the work. The only fear I have is, being side-tracked and falling back into bad habits.

Now, I was thinking, should I pay private tutors and therapists in order to get the highest grades? From experience, professors aren't exactly helpful (since most of the time their feedback is a bit vague rather than laser sharp specific), peers are temperamental (sometimes detrimental and immature too), and having emotional/psychological stability throughout is key.  What exactly is the specific formula to essentially being a top student AND involved in networking and sporting activities? I live in the UK so essentially, you have to get high grades the first time and consistently. Retaking them is essentially a slap to the face (you get a capped grade of C).

Please and thank you in advance =)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I am asking is that I want to study Software and electronic engineering (no surprise). It has been an interest of mine and tbh, I want to earn real money with a sense of reward. However, I feel that I will be overwhelmed and not on top of things. I have a degree in Psychology and well, I am willing to change my career paths. It is nice to help people but I am starting to feel more like a &amp;#39;butler&amp;#39; than an innovator. I think that studying engineering will help me be more of an innovator. The only reason I did not pursue a hardcore STEM first time around is because of my personal fuck-ups. I have made bad to mediocre decisions. So, bit by bit, I am willing to knuckle down and do the work. The only fear I have is, being side-tracked and falling back into bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was thinking, should I pay private tutors and therapists in order to get the highest grades? From experience, professors aren&amp;#39;t exactly helpful (since most of the time their feedback is a bit vague rather than laser sharp specific), peers are temperamental (sometimes detrimental and immature too), and having emotional/psychological stability throughout is key.

Input is a 90 turning into the bottom right, the output is vertical out of the top left of the array, with a manual water drain out of the bottom left.

&amp;#x200B;

Once it exits the system I will run the air through a standard filter/water trap just before dropping it into the tank.

&amp;#x200B;

My current compressor is a 165 max psi with 6-7 cfm @ 90psi, I will eventually be upgrading to a 175 15-20 cfm unit and wanted to carry this after-cooler over for future use.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process is by jumping up to a larger diameter with multiple paths I get to take advantage of the cooling effects of expansion as well as the heat dissipation into the copper tubing. Using the bottom right to top left design would allow the whole unit to be utilized vs just one side, and if I tilt the unit slightly off center to the left I should be able to direct the condensation to the moisture drain.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are...

Are there any contraindications to this design?

&amp;#x200B;

Before I cut up materials... is there a more cost-effective system you know of to achieve a similar result?

&amp;#x200B;

How tall should I make each vertical pipe?

&lt;p&gt;My thought process is by jumping up to a larger diameter with multiple paths I get to take advantage of the cooling effects of expansion as well as the heat dissipation into the copper tubing. Using the bottom right to top left design would allow the whole unit to be utilized vs just one side, and if I tilt the unit slightly off center to the left I should be able to direct the condensation to the moisture drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any contraindications to this design?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I cut up materials... is there a more cost-effective system you know of to achieve a similar result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How tall should I make each vertical pipe?&lt;/p&gt;

I currently work in the public sector with an organization I interned at, now one year out of school.  The job itself is fantastic.  Interesting work, lots of autonomy, lots of flexibility, and very secure.  Pay is decent and benefits are fantastic.  This is the type of place where people stay for life once they're in.

The only problem is the office politics.   I've worked at a lot of different places and know you get some of this everywhere, but this is by far the worst I've seen.  Shouting matches between co-workers is a regular thing, hours of daily gossip and complaining that prevents me from getting stuff done, and there are so many personal rivalries I end up playing go-between for people who don't want to communicate with each other.  I was hired for a position over my previous manager (who I still have to work with daily) and that ups the tension even more.  For the most part I stay out of things, but some days it can really drag me down.

I guess my question is whether or not it's worth trying to adapt to the work environment.  Management is happy with my performance and some of the worst offenders will be retiring in the next few years.

I don't know whether to panic now and starts to apply on non-engineering jobs, I'm only worried my skills go to waste or down rusty drains.

I'm finishing BS in mechanical engineering, however specializing in thermal (might be different system in other countries). HVAC is something I fell in love with as soon as I started studying it. My first project was calculating heat load of friend's building and for my diploma I'm making quite sweet excel worksheet for determining effect of unheated apartment(s) on apartment building and adjacent apartments. 

I'm trying to learn and follow as many standards as possible. And here it gets kind of silly.

Recently I've been invited to work on a project. I did my calculations, followed needed standards to the point, but calculation was mainly done using ISO 12831. Exception were thermal bridges which I determined approximately based on other standard and ventilation based on common sense, while still following standard od course.

So after I handed in my calculations, I got feedback my numbers are 15% off - too low - comparing to that guy's calculations and experience. He's following way older standard which many people seems to use and it's most similar to fast calculation method ISO 12831 offers, which is from my experience (project and diploma) quite off - can be up to 30% it seems. 

So naturally I started doubting in my calculations, even if I checked several times for any error. Argument why it was wrong was that I took improper U-value for windows, even if I know which windows are installed, by logic that gas leaks out and you should calculate worst scenario, which is in my opinion bullshit. Other argument was that heat load through the floor isn't high enough because water might flow less than 1m below the house - more than 10°C below freezing point?

Only thing I could think of is improper determination of thermal bridges, but standard provides good enough approximations that should, as I believe, be freely used in calculations and not give wrong numbers, if any give too high heat load result. 

Ia there a possibility that my calculations are correct, but in practice old school people ""overdimension"" things in fear it might not work well enough? Because they are used to it?

It makes me kind of scared if I'll work on a project alone that I'd screw things up and people would say ""hey, I'm cold in my house!"".

Has any of you had similar experience? If yes, how did you deal with it?

I am a relatively new mechancial engineer in the semiconductor industry that has been tasked with overseeing the installation and use of a modular cleanroom. This includes everything from the actual purchase and construction, to the furnishing and process development for the day-to-day operations of the cleanroom. I have a few questions I am hoping people with more experience in cleanrooms can help me with.

1. What are some good resources on cleanroom protocol and 5s for processes specifically in cleanrooms? I think I have a general idea of this, it's really all about proper layering of garments and being meticulous about not disturbing too many particles, but I'd like to see something that goes into real detail.
2. What are some reputable vendors/brands for cleanroom equipment? What sort of specifications should I look out for on things like garments (ESD, fabric type, etc.)  or furniture (materials, particle accumulation, etc.) to judge whether or not they are quality?
3. Can anyone provide more insight on the HVAC work that goes on in air return walls? The purpose is to recirculate the filtered air back to the cieling plenum, but how does the ducting specifically interact with the plenum? Is the air just returned to the open plenum, connected to the air return for the air handler, or ducted directly to fan filters?

I'd appreciate any insight.

Scenario 1: The apartment units are utilizing natural ventilation.  The corridors are served by split systems on each floor.  The split systems receive outside air.  If I'm trying to keep the corridor positively pressurized, how do I account for exhaust fans, range hoods, and dryers?  Let's say I have a 50 cfm bathroom fan, a 300 cfm range hood, and a 100 cfm dryer.  All of these things operate intermittently.  Should I add 450 cfm to the corridor for each apartment?  That's adds up to a lot!  Is there a diversity I can apply to it?  Should I just add 450 cfm of OA total to the corridor with the thought that only one apartment door will be open at a time.  That would leave the apartments very negatively pressurized when someone is using the kitchen fan (which will invite a lot of infiltration from outside).

Scenario 2:  The apartment units are bringing in OA to a split system.  With everything else being equal, I imagine I could take the amount of OA from Scenario 1 and subtract the OA being introduced to the units.  If that's true, would it be cumulative for all the apartments?

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, there would need to be some kind of relief, right?  Like a gravity relief damper on each floor?

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing 100% OA rooftop units for the corridors is preferable, however we don't always get that luxury.  And it still begs the question as to how much air to use.  At least with 100% OA RTUs we can lower the total supply air since it's all ventilation air.

&amp;#x200B;

My predecessor had a rule of thumb (40 cfm per apartment for natural ventilation and 15 cfm per apartment for mechanical ventilation of dwelling units).  But I have no idea where he got those numbers from.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two scenarios and I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find a reliable source that quantifies how much air to use.  I&amp;#39;d appreciate any insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: The apartment units are utilizing natural ventilation.  The corridors are served by split systems on each floor.  The split systems receive outside air.  If I&amp;#39;m trying to keep the corridor positively pressurized, how do I account for exhaust fans, range hoods, and dryers?  Let&amp;#39;s say I have a 50 cfm bathroom fan, a 300 cfm range hood, and a 100 cfm dryer.  All of these things operate intermittently.  Should I add 450 cfm to the corridor for each apartment?  That&amp;#39;s adds up to a lot!  Is there a diversity I can apply to it?  Should I just add 450 cfm of OA total to the corridor with the thought that only one apartment door will be open at a time.  That would leave the apartments very negatively pressurized when someone is using the kitchen fan (which will invite a lot of infiltration from outside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2:  The apartment units are bringing in OA to a split system.  With everything else being equal, I imagine I could take the amount of OA from Scenario 1 and subtract the OA being introduced to the units.

My question is basically the following: my AC unit has two intakes, one large one at the back of the unit just under the vent hose and a smaller one on the side. To which of the intakes should I connect the second hose? This will be the hose that draws in air from outside so the machine doesn't use the cold air in the room.

I had my performance review today with my department manager and my team manager. I have been working there for just about a year now right out of college.

I got glowing reviews across the board for my primary job responsibilities and also for the additional responsibilities I took on. In addition, I will be taking up more responsibilities immediately and working on special projects and taking more management roles. I was told that my manager put in a request for a 5-10% increase in salary to upper management (relatively small company, without tiered job titles), and said he was really pushing for 10% for me. 

Now, I am really grateful that my manager is pushing for a higher raise for me instead of trying to give me the bare minimum. However, even with the 10% increase, I believe I am underpaid for my job title in my area according to Glassdoor, Salary.com, and Indeed. I firmly believe that a 12-15% raise is a fairer recognition of my value to the company.

The salary increase isn't confirmed yet, and he said that he will get back to me with the decision from upper management next week. **My question is: should I communicate beforehand that 12-15% raise is fairer than that 10% that I might get? Or should I wait until he calls me in sometime next week to formally negotiate it.** I have enough evidence and support from the performance review to make a very strong case for the 12-15% raise, but I don't want to seem ungrateful for the 10% either.

My thinking was that I wouldn't want him to jump through hoops to get me 10%, get it approved from upper management, and then I come in and ask for more. But this is my first time negotiating a raise, so everything about this is fairly intimidating.

Any advice is appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

I am a 7 year engineer, 5 years in power generation and then I jumped to DOD Military contract sector (its a full time job, going on year 2). Also had an internship in an aerospace sector.

Real long story short, my place of work has been working on this ""transition period"" to move all engineering and manufacturing to my facility.  I was hired during this transition as one of the first M.E.s at this location (which in the end will be the largest facility).

Additionally we found out that E.Es start at 10-13k higher.

At this time a few of us are trying to wrap our heads around the situation.  We know they were building a department with X budget.  However at this point, the more senior knowledgeable members are being paid less than their newbie counter parts and way less than the EEs.  The MEs are project leads, designers, etc who drive the ship essentially and the EEs seem to be support.

At this time a lot of us feel under valued.  Unfortunately (or fortunately) I really do like this company and where it could be going.  But at this time others have jumped ship (drafting and engineering) due to money.

Last summer I got my first experience in the field through an internship, and even got to take some flying lessons on the side, which was an unforgettable experience. I still hope to obtain my PPL one day. 

In December I graduated with a BSEE focusing in electromagnetics, and in February started working at a different, well-known aerospace company as an electromagnetic compatibility engineer. On paper, it’s everything my “dream” job ought to be. Four months in, while I don’t hate it, I’m already realizing I don’t want to be in this industry, nor work in the same role, my entire career.

To be clear, I have no doubt I’m getting good experience, and indeed, I’m using quite a bit of knowledge from my EM and RF classes. I've already gained a ton of practical knowledge of EMC in aerospace in just a few months. My coworkers are nice and very knowledgeable, there’s some business travel associated with my job, and so far I’d like to think I’ve done a decent job of learning the ropes of what is generally considered a pretty niche field - even if I don't want to stay in it for too long.

But as I was warned about plenty of times as a student, the industry is very bureaucratic, with a seemingly endless list of standards and other technical documentation to follow for everything. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate why all of it’s necessary for safety, and absolutely respect the work of those engineers who spend their entire careers in EMC. Regardless, at the end of the day, even if I’m working around some amazing aircraft, the role doesn’t leave me feeling extremely satisfied or motivated purely out of passion. The office environment was also a somewhat jarring transition, and I'm still ambivalent as to how I feel about the routine of working 9-5. I miss the flexibility of university and having friends in such close proximity, but the freedom outside of work to pursue other non-engineering interests cannot be understated.

Anyways, my exit plan is to pursue my masters abroad in the latter half of next year, which I went into some detail [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/b0h73v/is_wanderlust_a_good_enough_reason_to_pursue_a/). I tell myself that everything I’m doing now - saving money, researching programs, learning my target languages, etc. - is a relatively short-term sacrifice/effort in order to achieve that goal. In the meantime, I'm trying my best to keep other hobbies alive, and maintain a somewhat active social life.

So, r/AskEngineers, what advice would you give someone in my situation? If y’all have similar personal experiences, especially with aerospace, I would be happy to hear them. Did you change to a different role in the same industry, or change industries altogether? Were you ever worried about being pigeonholed?

I know this is a really borad question, but the specifics of the question was hard to put into the title.

I wrote a paper on the Chernobyl accident for an assignment in my major (Security &amp; Safety Engineering) a few months back and found something that I can't wrap my head around:

On 26th of April 1986, beginning at 01:23:04 there was a rundown test of turbogenerator No. 8 to check if it can provide enough energy to the main circulation pumps. In the course of that test the reactor went super critical and exploded. The thing that I don't understand is this:

In all documentaries, some books, the TV show and all youtube videos I could find on the topic it is stated that the reactor experienced a power excursion beginning at approx 01:23:30. The explanation is that after the rundown of the turbine, the main circulation pumps connected to it started to run down too, reducing the flow through the core. This lead to an increase in steam quality and hence the void fraction in the lower part of the core. This in turn lead to an increase in power because more voids mean more reactivity. The operators noticed this and initiated the emergency shutdown (AZ-5). And now the design of the control rods lead to an addition of positive reactivity in the lower core, cementing the disaster.
This is what I knew before I stareted the assignment and what is reiterated everywhere. The main sources with a legit scientific background I could find that support this version of events is the US NRC Report from 1987[1] and a paper from 1988[2].

But when I read the Shteynberg Commission Report from 1991[4] and the Report by Abagyan from 1991[5] which both are published and translated in INSAG-7 by the IAEA there where two details that seem to contradict this version of events:

1. It is stated that the Shteynberg Commission could not establish why AZ-5 was pressed. This is really out of the ordinary if there was a power excursion happening before 01:23:40. Under the circumstances of a power excursion there is a obvious reason to push this button.

2. The Shteynberg Commission stated that until 01:23:40 the reactor ran stable and that void creation was minimal. If the Turbine is isolated from the main coolant loop (MFC) the pressure increases slightly because there is not enough removal of heat in contrast of normal operation.

3. The Shteynberg Commission stated that all 8 main circulation pumps where running on almost full power, with 4 involved in the test. So the other 4 where still connected to the grid and could pick up the load required to compensate for the rundown of the other 4 pumps. They state that the overall loss of volumetric coolant flow from start of the test to the explosion only decreased 15 %. This seems to be supported by the 'one overcompensation upward' signal (what it exactly means would be my first question - my guess is it warns of too much coolant being ciculated).

4. The Shteynberg Commission stated that until AZ-5 was pushed no intervention by the crew was neccessary.

5. Abagyan has [this](https://i.imgur.com/tUB7kzZ.png) graphic in the report that shows the *relative* neutron flux at the time where AZ-5 is pushed and during the subsequent seconds. This graphic is also circulated in a few youtube videos stating the first version from above. ~~But for me it looks like at 0s the lower core is nearly at a shutdown condition~~. This flux condition suggests that it did not already started to run away. Am I misinterpreting this graphic? Edit: [This](https://i.imgur.com/3JH7xuj.png) is the distribution over a period of several hours before the accident.

Now I found a simulation study in nuclear engineering and design that substantiates the findings of the above mentioned reports [6]. It stated that the void creation was supressed by the increase in pressure during the test and the loss of volumetric coolant flow was not sufficient to trigger void creation. It showed that the power excursion began because of the design flaw of the control rods alone and the voiding of fuel channels only started as a result of that:

Am I missing something here? Is it just that the first version is so rooted in memory that the new version never found its way into public conciousness? I'm at a loss - I'm neither a chemical engineer that understands enough about the Ranike Cycle at this level or Nuclear Engineer to be certain which sources to trust or what to believe anymore.

If you have the knowledge to bring light to this issue I'd be really glad. I'm getting headaces over this for a few weeks now.

Edit: To be clear here - I know that it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. I'm just interested in the technical side of things.

I'm looking into monitoring realtime electricity usage of events/festivals using current clamp sensors.

I already have an internet-connected monitoring device that connect to three individual current clamp sensors.

As your probably know I can't just put a clamp over the entire cable because the currents in the individual cables (Line &amp; neutral) would cancel out. An AC [line/phase splitter](https://www.reinhardweiss.de/german/splitter-mls01.htm) solves this problem; it allows current clamp acces to the individual lines.

Now my question: do these line splitters also exist for three phase cables? Larger events use 400V three phase power (3P+N+PE) over here.

Are there any other approaches to monitoring the electricity usage realtime? End goal is to have a dashboard that shows realtime electricity consumption. The dashboard is meant to give visitors insight in the energy consumption of the festival. With the objective of promoting rational energy usage &amp; showcasing the sustainability efforts of the organizer.

BSEE, currently pursuing a masters in Systems Engineering.

I am nearing 3 years of experience working in the defense industry as a Test Engineer. This experience has been split between 2 separate companies with wildly different tasks but relatively same title and level.

In my first job, I did testing and sustainment of a large radar system. This also involved validation of lower level assemblies and gave me an introduction to working with RF. Most of knowledge I gained here was really specific to that system, the company and their process. I was also introduced to some automated testing and developed good testing instinct that really translated well into my next job.

In my current job, I do automated test software development and test equipment design for their particular products. I've worked with NI TestStand, LabWindows, have had some hardware design opportunities (nothing crazy), and I might be a bit too familiar with Keysight equipment. I do a crap load of other stuff too that involving processes, paperwork, working with outside vendors, and so on but I think that reflects more so on my soft skills.

**I don't want to pigeon hole myself into testing related positions right now.** 

However, my fundamentals in both electrical engineering and programming are definitely inconsistent and I'm not sure I'll pass for entry level design roles or software roles that would give me more opportunities to program, firmware included. I am also worried about moving laterally again. The four areas I'm most interested in is RF, Digital Design, firmware, and software work. I do really enjoy defense systems too.

I think what sucks the most is that I'm happy with what and who I am working with but I know I need to push my career forward. If it helps, I currently make about 80K as a level 1 Test Engineer or G8, and that is fairly comfortable for my location.


TL;DR Been doing test engineering for close to 3 years, have a good head on my shoulders, am I ready to move on to a design role? Should I move on?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context:

&lt;p&gt;In my first job, I did testing and sustainment of a large radar system. This also involved validation of lower level assemblies and gave me an introduction to working with RF. Most of knowledge I gained here was really specific to that system, the company and their process. I was also introduced to some automated testing and developed good testing instinct that really translated well into my next job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my current job, I do automated test software development and test equipment design for their particular products. I&amp;#39;ve worked with NI TestStand, LabWindows, have had some hardware design opportunities (nothing crazy), and I might be a bit too familiar with Keysight equipment. I do a crap load of other stuff too that involving processes, paperwork, working with outside vendors, and so on but I think that reflects more so on my soft skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to pigeon hole myself into testing related positions right now.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my fundamentals in both electrical engineering and programming are definitely inconsistent and I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ll pass for entry level design roles or software roles that would give me more opportunities to program, firmware included. I am also worried about moving laterally again. The four areas I&amp;#39;m most interested in is RF, Digital Design, firmware, and software work. I do really enjoy defense systems too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what sucks the most is that I&amp;#39;m happy with what and who I am working with but I know I need to push my career forward. If it helps, I currently make about 80K as a level 1 Test Engineer or G8, and that is fairly comfortable for my location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Been doing test engineering for close to 3 years, have a good head on my shoulders, am I ready to move on to a design role? Should I move on?&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most aerodynamic cars on the road these days is the Tesla Model S, it has a drag of 6.2 Cd x Ft2 as designed in 2012

However more recent cars like the Mazda 3 (7.31 Cd x Ft2) are worse.

&lt;p&gt;I am Begum who is studying masters in Goldsmiths, University of London. I am doing academic research about female chemical engineers’ career development and their innovation capabilities in the United Kingdom. I would like to have an interview with female engineers according to learn and observe their career paths. If you are willing to join my research, please contact me or if you have more details questions about my research.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Guys.

[https://imgur.com/a/zk73xs6](https://imgur.com/a/zk73xs6)

Currently carrying out some complex steel to steel moment connections and am required to use SCI P398 for the equivalent T-stub lengths. When checking the required thickness of the plate (which is a full depth end plate) should I be carrying out a check on the top row - which will have the highest tension - calculating my Leff for the top row. When it is substituted into the equation to give FTRD..is the value of FTRD only for that top row, or is it the total that the plate can carry?

Once this check has been carried out should I repeat the process for the internal bolt rows?

Appreciate this probably isn't the clearest, but hopefully the Imgur links will help.

TLDR: dual degree Physics + Civil engineering is taking its toll on my WAM (due to difficult physics subjects) . Will employers understand this and take this into account when reviewing my resume?

So I'm currently halfway through my 3rd year of studying full-time, aiming to graduate university with a Bachelor of Physics and a Bachelor of Civil Engineering after my 6th and final year. I am sitting on a 77 WAM (from Australia so not familiar with GPA). However, whilst I immensely enjoy my physics subjects, they are significantly more challenging than any engineering subject I have taken so far. 
Apologies for the rant but at the moment I am required to sit 3 simultaneous math subjects this semester, none of which are required if I were to only pursue the engineering degree. The only other students taking these subjects are those who study pure/advanced math. My mark for these subjects are quite worse than all my other previous subjects taken.

Although I'm finding this degree very rewarding and interesting, I can not help but feel frustrated at the fact that when application time comes around, I will not be anywhere near as competitive as I could potentially be in terms of my GPA/WAM  due to taking these subjects. Any advice/information regarding my current position would be very much appreciated!!

Im new to the subreddit because I just finished my masters of engineering in Germany a couple weeks ago.

Before that I worked part time at a different hvac designing office.
I’m very specialist in HVAC designing, analyzing  and energy management/efficency. The closest to it is mechanical engineering.  
I really like the job and I would have a great future in this firm. 
Problem is, that my wife is American and wants to move back to Florida.
So here are my concerns: 

-	can I work as an engineer with my German masters in the USA for example as a senior engineer in a construction firm?
-	Do i need the FE and later the PE to get the most out of my masters?
-	What can I do before I come over to prepare myself?

Feels kinda overwhelming to leave a very secure job and have no idea how I will end up in Florida with my degree.
Does anyone have some tips for me?

I have finals in a week for chemistry and engineering physics and I should be studying, but everything just came crashing down in my head and I just need to take 30 minutes to vent it all out, you know? This might be a long read but it would mean so much if just one person knew how I felt.

In terms of being an ""engineer"", I'm not a smart person. I was never genuinely good at math and I'm only good at ""pull and chug"" problems like some lifeless robot. I horribly suck at problem solving to the point where it's laughable because I lack any form of patience. Calculus and physics in general makes no sense to me at all and everything I try to ""learn"" in physics class just goes over my head. I'm a very slow learner, and I just don't have the mind capable of doing complicated stuff like this despite studying and doing the homework at my snail's pace. I've always known I was inferior to my friends in class who can just absorb the physics and calculus material like sponges. You see, I LOVED subjects in high school such as English, world history, geography, foreign languages, etc, and I still continue to do so. I love creative writing as a hobby and I write on a daily basis, just writing meaningless stories. I love all this. It sucks to know that I'm only good at all the useless shit. I see the world in words, not equations. And you're all probably wondering why I'm even in engineering.

It's my family. My dad and mom want me to pursue engineering; it doesn't matter what field of engineering, as long as it's engineering. They were born in the Philippines and knew what it was like to actually *struggle.* They moved to the US and then I was born (unfortunately), and them being an engineer and a nurse respectively, they did this for me and the family. So I can utilize resources and opportunities on US soil that the PH didn't have. And I did for a time. I got a 3.8 GPA in high school, did sports, and got into my state's top ranked public university to study civil engineering. That was 4 years ago; I'm 22 now. Since then, I had to drop out of university after the first year and I settled into a local community college in my area. I've had very low grades (50s - 70s) in my calculus and physics classes over and over again as if I were trapped in a whirlpool, because none of it makes *fucking* sense. I just don't know why, but working with math makes my brain freeze. I don't have dyscalculia either because if I did, then I would have done poorly in my math classes in high school too. But at the college level, I've lost my direction and I find my math and physics classes extremely boring and excruciating, compared to where I used to find them interesting and intriguing. In general, I've lost direction in my life and I truly don't know what I want to do. My GPA now is sitting at a 2.6 and I plan on retaking those same calculus and physics classes yet again, but I am so, *so* burned out.

I can't just switch out of engineering that easily. I can't just tell my mom ""hey, I don't want to be an engineer anymore"" like most people can. They're the traditional Asian parents who try to guide my life so I wouldn't go homeless and penniless, and they truly mean well. We've spent too much money on my classes for the past 4 years, I HAVE TO finish civil engineering at this point. But these mathematical classes are seriously eating away at my sanity and I have no one to talk to. Engineering drew me in initially because I wanted to help make a difference in the world with my creativity, but I lack the math brain to survive the ordeal. I feel the itching urge to finish my degree as soon as possible because we only have so much time in life.

Lately, I've looked into forestry engineering (I've actually never heard of the field until a few weeks ago) and it's slowly and steadily rejuvenizing my mental strength to pass my classes. The natural world has always been important to me and the conservation of forests is something I can wholeheartedly put my efforts into. I really loved biology in high school, and combining ecology with physics actually sounds enjoyable because I'm doing something that means a lot to me. But I feel like I've blown so many opportunities by now, especially moving from a university to a community-college and failing classes at both colleges. I can always go back to my university by applying directly to the engineering program, but I blew my first chance and took it for granted. I feel like an absolute failure to my family and I probably am; I was the child at family parties who would be showed off as ""most likely to be successful and get rich"" towards my uncles and aunts. Now I feel trapped working towards a career that I will probably end up despising and wishing I was dead every morning, but in turn, it makes my family happy and I could support myself financially.

A while back, I had this crazy idea to build my own hottub in the garden that is capable of heating the water using a stove. After everything was slowly put together, I have not been able to get the water to heat up fast enough (it is very slow).

&amp;#x200B;

Below you can see an image of the setup. 

&amp;#x200B;

After measuring the temperature at the top part, I nearly instantly reach the max temp of my thermometer whilst at the exit of the warm air (at the bottom of the setup) the temp is approx 35 degrees Celsius (ie heat is being transferred). The tubing that functions as the heat exchanging surface is made out of copper (due to its heat transfer properties (diameter 1.5cm - length 9m)). The water is being actively pumped through the setup with a pump at about 600 L/min.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone told me that I should get a pump with a lower flow rate, because the water is not getting warm enough fast enough with the setup... but according to me, the higher the temperature difference, the higher the total amount of energy transferred from the hot air to the cold water. 

Someone else told me I should isolate the outside of the stove, but with small flames sometimes coming out of the top, I have no idea of what materials would be appropriate to insulate the stove that reaches high temperature (any wooly materials would start burning slowly?).

A machinist replaced the stepper motor for the spindle and it still wouldn’t rotate. The motor just buzzed and heated up. The problem was that he wired it incorrectly. It was pointed out to me that the manufacturer made a field alteration that includes a new pot. From tinkering, it seems to increase the frequency to the field windings.

I'm currently doing research in a lab that's a cross between engineering and physics. I do a lot of experimental work, then need to analyze and log/present my results. While Excel (and Origin) are both capable of this, I've begun using MATLAB to automate some of the process with the hopes of automating all of it. I will also begin using the language to create simulations and may create GUIs and run optimization problems in the near future. My question is, before I dedicate myself to MATLAB, would Python be a better avenue.

On the logistical side, my labmates use MATLAB as it's what they're familiar with and we have licenses at work. I also have access to MATLAB at home, so availability isn't an issue. I can also access Python from home and work. When I mentioned my dilemma to my supervisor he recommended I stick to whatever would be more beneficial in the future, and while he doesn't know Python, he'd be willing to see what it's capable of.

&amp;#x200B;

Even before I knew or saw any information about the machine I knew it was a scam due to the absurd amount of money needed to get the distribution, shady business practices, fake documentation (ex. stock photos used as proof of the facilities where they are being built, fake company names used as references, etc.) and the everchanging specifics of how the machine actually works (for example, early on the inventor claimed that it needed no outside energy whatsoever to generate free electricity, to later on explaining that it indeed needed electricity to function, but the output of the machine is orders of magnitude bigger than the input).

&amp;#x200B;

After months of pointing out all the red flags and the fact that they seemed to be unable to finish installing the demo machine, my acquaintance was finally about to pull the plug on this money drenching venture, when the dam thing started working and now he is even more willing to mortgage his future for this.

I remember being told in college that it would get easier after college, but I'm finding that the opposite is true, I focus a lot on the projects I'm given (so much so that I have a bit of a reputation in the office as being a slow worker), and even then I notice that no matter how much time I spend on something, I'm always worried that I fucked up somewhere without realizing and that eventually it's going to bite me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? I've been trying lately to let things go, to get things ""good enough"" so that I can move on to something else, because there's always something else that needs to be sorted. But there's always this nagging feeling that I should spend more time  on things and I'm finding it hard to find a balance between quality work and fast work.

\- This job involves relocating, the location is far away but is a great place to live.

\- The pay is slightly worse, but not by much.

Job 2: Project Engineer at a consumer product company.

\- Larger company with 50 people in office (manufacturing overseas).

\- Project engineer is more overhead work and less design and decision-making that I would prefer.

\- The products they design are somewhat interesting to me.

\- This job does not involve relocating, and i like my current location.

\- The pay is slightly better, I could live more comfortably.

**Background**:

So I am interning in at a company that has assigned me a very large project that could potentially be implemented nationwide. My job isn't so much to find a solution to a problem but more so identify and prove that a problem exists and justifying using resources that would involve finding a solution later on (solution to problem is outside scope of summer internship).

This project was assigned to me an individual that is above anyone at my current location for the position I am interning for (ex: NA manager (so this person) &gt; regional manager &gt; site manager &gt; position I am interning for). This is a very important project to this individual and they selected me specifically because of my background in engineering (interning for safety). The NA manager cares very much about this project and has given me full control of how to lead it and has informed me that they will provide any resources that I may need to assist me with accomplishing this project. I am working alone on this project, but I do have people around me at my site that I can ask if I have questions or want ideas from them. Most associates have told me they aren't sure why I was given such a big project that is very difficult as opposed to a project that focuses on their specific site rather than implementing something nationwide.

**Problem with my project**:

Unfortunately, I feel like I am doing a very poor job managing this project right now and feel very defeated despite barely starting the project a couple of weeks ago. In school, we usually work with teams or have help from our professors in order to help finish a problem. And different parts of the project are done by different people. Now, I am being given a project where essentially I will decide everything and I need to manage my time, tasks, deliverable, ensure goals are met, etc.

I was given an internal tool like Microsoft project that they use so I can set up milestones, tasks, and everyone can see where I am on my project. Only my project sponsor and I currently look at it. Since my project sponsor isn't ever at our site because they travel, they have different priorities, views, and perspective on how my internship should go. They want me to devote a lot of attention to the project but the project is separate from doing my daily responsibilities for the position I will hopefully become full-time for.

**Problem managing my time**:

In order to not neglect my associates at my site, I have a good amount of time shadowing them, learning from them and performing the responsibilities for that position. I have also spent days focusing solely on my project. But it is hard to know how much time to spend working on my project vs. working with my team. My team and project sponsor are definitely not on the same page as far as what the goals of my internship are. And I have brought this up and they are understanding if I ask to work on my project, but politics are everywhere and I know that if I spend more time on my project, it will look bad on my part. Because of how I spend my days, I feel that I am not doing what needs to be done for my project. My project sponsor gave me a timeline for what I should deliver every week and what my focus should be for that week. I set this up in their internal tool to where we can see my progress.

**Problem with executing and making decisions**:

I have spent so much time investigating and looking into the tasks she assigned for the first week that pretty much define what the project scope will be, purpose, what we will study, etc. After all of my investigation, I am not sure how to deliver that to her in a short report (I was informed if I am spending more than 15 minutes on writing a report of the findings of my weekly tasks, I am doing something wrong). I am not sure if I should do this in a PowerPoint and present it to her, should I make it into a word document?

**Underlying Issue**:

I guess what most of this stems from is that while I am confident in my technical abilities and I have already demonstrated my knowledge in numerous areas, I am struggling with actually leading a project, how to organize what I will be doing, how to spend my days, how to document my findings, etc. It's pretty embarrassing and I have done independent projects in school, but again, most everything was laid out for me. I just don't want to mess up such a big project for someone that has really high expectations for the results.

Thanks to whoever took the time to read this and good luck to any other interns out there!

**TLDR**: Was given big project by someone high in chain of command and am struggling with how to lead it and deliver a project where I am responsible for deciding everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be more of a rant, but definitely looking for some guidance or advice from anyone that has been in this situation and overcome or just that can relate to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am interning in at a company that has assigned me a very large project that could potentially be implemented nationwide. My job isn&amp;#39;t so much to find a solution to a problem but more so identify and prove that a problem exists and justifying using resources that would involve finding a solution later on (solution to problem is outside scope of summer internship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was assigned to me an individual that is above anyone at my current location for the position I am interning for (ex: NA manager (so this person) &amp;gt; regional manager &amp;gt; site manager &amp;gt; position I am interning for). This is a very important project to this individual and they selected me specifically because of my background in engineering (interning for safety). The NA manager cares very much about this project and has given me full control of how to lead it and has informed me that they will provide any resources that I may need to assist me with accomplishing this project. I am working alone on this project, but I do have people around me at my site that I can ask if I have questions or want ideas from them. Most associates have told me they aren&amp;#39;t sure why I was given such a big project that is very difficult as opposed to a project that focuses on their specific site rather than implementing something nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem with my project&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I feel like I am doing a very poor job managing this project right now and feel very defeated despite barely starting the project a couple of weeks ago. In school, we usually work with teams or have help from our professors in order to help finish a problem. And different parts of the project are done by different people. Now, I am being given a project where essentially I will decide everything and I need to manage my time, tasks, deliverable, ensure goals are met, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was given an internal tool like Microsoft project that they use so I can set up milestones, tasks, and everyone can see where I am on my project. Only my project sponsor and I currently look at it. Since my project sponsor isn&amp;#39;t ever at our site because they travel, they have different priorities, views, and perspective on how my internship should go. They want me to devote a lot of attention to the project but the project is separate from doing my daily responsibilities for the position I will hopefully become full-time for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem managing my time&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to not neglect my associates at my site, I have a good amount of time shadowing them, learning from them and performing the responsibilities for that position.

The barrel will have a radius of either 2/3 meter to 1 meter.

So if there are a series of resistors in parallel in a circuit, the total resistance of them is 1/(1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) ..., so that the resistance is lower than that of the lowest resistor in the circuit... My first question is why does that make sense, why is there less resistance when a higher resistor is added in parallel than if there was only the first resistor?

The more important question to me is about one example from in the book... so there is a circuit which is a 12V battery and 3 parallel 10 Ohm resistors. The 3rd resistor shorts, and the batteries resistance is 2 Ohms when a short happens, I must find the Amperage running through the circuit. So using the logic of the previous problems I used the equation for resistance, and add to the battery (as they are not parallel to it, but in series) as such...

Amperage = 12V / (1/(1/10 Ohms) + (1/10 Ohms) + 1/0 Ohms)) + (2 Ohms),

This has a divide by zero error...

The books answer is six, which means that it is really the 12V / 2 Ohms of the battery itself, which leads to my real question... Why when a resistor has a very near zero resistance (like 0.0001 Ohms) does electricity flow through all resistors, hence the equation must be used to find amperage, but when there is Zero Ohms at one spot, ALL current flows through it? Am I missing something?

I'm an ME student so what I know about the automotive industry is the little I've heard from a couple of my classes + what I've read on the internet. I just don't see aluminum being a sustainable solution to something that isn't really a problem.

I don't have an idea as to how much, but I know that the raw materials cost is higher with aluminum. This would be a greater expense for Ford (or whoever), but would the cost of production drop? Low-grade aluminum isn't as 'strong' as low grade steel, so in theory the presses (or mills, whatever process is changing the metal) consume less power and last longer. I can't imagine Ford buying high grade aluminum (or steel) when they can strain harden it and have the same mechanical properties. So the raw materials are more expensive, but I'd assume that the production is cheaper. Is this assumption correct?

Another selling point is that it 'doesn't rust'. It may not rust, but it certainly corrodes... My alloy wheels had some ugly corrosion, and I've seen plenty of crusty aluminum hoods from Chrysler vehicles at the scrapyard. The repair industry is setup around steel, and I can't imagine there are very many shops (or dealerships, yet) that are capable of welding aluminum. Not sure if Ford (or whoever) cares about this, but it's something a lot of consumers should worry about.

Aluminum is also lighter, so in theory you can make a bigger vehicle and still meet weight requirements, which I'm imagining customers will flock to. However, for aluminum to have the same mechanical properties (tensile strength, toughness etc) as steel it either needs to be  'higher grade' or undergo some sort of strain hardening. Or, the parts themselves would have to be thicker... All 3 of those options adding to the cost of production, which the potential customer ends up paying for.

The economics of it don't make sense to me either. If this enormous demand of aluminum is placed on the aluminum industry, the price will only increase, yet another expense for the car MFR. Won't this decrease in steel consumption raise the price of steel too? I can see this dominoing into a lot of other things, but I don't know much about the raw materials market. 

I've also read that steel is easier to recycle. Not sure how valid that claim is, but given that car bodies have been made of steel since the beginning of time, it makes sense to me. Easier to repurpose, less of it ends up in a landfill.

Being composed of Iron, steel also doesn't have an endurance limit, where aluminum does. Not sure how much of a factor this is when designing car bodies, but that's something that steel has going for it.

The only benefit I see is a lighter vehicle, but if it's larger then it won't be much lighter. A larger vehicle also seems to me like it would have more air resistance, yielding lower fuel economy at higher speeds. 

Again, I'm just a student so I don't know jack shit. Switching to aluminum just doesn't seem like a sustainable decision to me. I'm inclined to think it's marketing wank... If it were 'the superior material', the Japanese would be doing it too. So would truck MFRs (peterbilt, kenworth, etc). All of this is just kinda spitballing, but I'd love it if someone from the auto or raw materials industries would give some input.

Before I start, I want to preface saying I am a fairly competent person that likes doing handyman-type stuff around my house. I know little, but I love the work and I want to try to learn as much as I can.  

Here's what you need to know: We are putting a standalone garage in soon (as soon as the concrete guy gets some free time to pour our pad). The garage will be steel construction 30x36. The side walls will be 12'. We plan on putting a 30x16 (10' walls) room in the back of the garage. This room will be sealed off, insulated, and temperature controlled(we live in FL) for a gym area.

Here's what I need help with: I want to know if I should use 2x8s (or thicker) joists for the ceiling or if I need to  use I-beams or LVL beams.  There will be a small loft (glorified attic) for storage above there with simple OSB as the flooring.

A follow up question: We are getting a cement pad poured for an outdoor area as well, I plan on building a pergola out there since it is a south facing patio behind our house.  The one part of the pergola will need to be attached to the house (on the roof).  This pergola would ideally be 16x30'.  I haven't found good plans or knowledge on something this size.  Right now I planned to use 6x6s for the posts of the pergola and space them every 10' then attach to the roof with one of the roof brackets. The beams for this, I was thinking would be 10"" and then have 6"" boards as the rafters.  But again, I haven't been able to find any solid information on this.

We plan on using fabric airforms for the concrete forms based on Mark West's ""The Fabric Formwork"" book. Mark is at MIT and has ressurected fabric formwork design. I can get 1.5"" concrete walls with 1/4"" tolerances based on supplier specs. Of course thicker walls are also possible but the idea is to use as little concrete as possible.

The idea is to build 900 square foot octoganal domes in a single monolithic pour with 10' walls and roof in one pour using self-consolidating concrete. Helix micro-steel says they can eliminate the horizontal runs of rebar with their helix micro-steel fibers. We can vary the roof pitch based on what will give us the best strength/weight ratio.

Which leaves the vertical rebar schedule. I was hoping we could use helix steel fibers to replace them but after talking to their rep he says that didn't sound possible. But they could only tell after seeing structural drawings, which we don't have at this point.

There are alternatives to traditional steel including basalt rebar, fibers or mesh or even basalt rope. Which would be easier to work with than steel rebar based on our thin shell airform design.

Since we're trying to figure out whether all this feasible or not and at what cost I don't want to engage an engineer until we actually decide it's worth doing and we need a stamp. So I'm trying to get at least a good estimate of the vertical rebar requirements so we can do some cowboy math and make a go/no go decision.

I think automation would be a very cool field to get into, but with a degree in chemical engineering I find it hard to do that without a whole ton of experience. I have been looking into masters degrees in robotics/automation and am wondering if someone has done something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? Will it be worth it to quit and get a masters degree full time? I really just need a change and with our current family situation, it seems like it might be a good time to do this in my career. Have always wanted a masters in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

The facility where I work has a 100% outside air HVAC system. This is probably because in addition to offices, we have some labs with fume hoods.  

We have a chiller/cooling tower which supplies the air handlers with 44 DegF (7 DegC) cooling water. The air handler takes in 100% outside air, cools it and distributes this now very cold dry air throughout the facility. In addition, we have natural gas fed boilers which supply hot water throughout the building.

Every room has it's own thermostat and heat-exchanger so the very cold air can be heated using the boiler supplied water to the occupant's desired temperature.

When the outside air temperature is below freezing, the air handlers just heat up the incoming air.

Exhaust fans take all this nice dry cold (or warm) air and blow it out stacks on our roof.

Needless to say, our power and gas bills are enormous for a building of our size.

I'm an EE who did a little work in industrial controls a long time ago so HVAC isn't really my thing. Our facilities guy is trained to fix HVAC, not to second-guess whoever designed it.

**My question is:** It seems as if the chiller set-point should vary depending on either the outside humidity or perhaps the chilled air humidity. On a humid day, it makes sense to have really cold coils to get all that salty water (we're on the coast) out of the supply air, but on a nice spring day, couldn't you dial it back a little. Less power to chill the water, less gas to warm it back up.

I did have a thought that it's somewhat self regulating, as less humid supply air will lead to cooler return water from the air handler so less work to chill it again, but I'm not the ME.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First some background:&lt;/strong&gt;

Hey guys,Recently i decided to get the ICM-20948 DK and exploring it.I read all the info on their site and all their guides but the only briefly get over the topic, so i didn't understand much.I need help working with it with Atmel studio program.

The DK-20948 is a comprehensive development platform for ICM-20948, a high performance 9-axis motion sensor that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis compass, and a DMP™ (Digital Motion Processor™).

The platform designed around Microchip G55 MCU can be used by developers for rapid evaluation and development of ICM-20948 based solutions. The DK-20948 includes an on-board Embedded Debugger so external tools are not required to program or debug the G55 MCU.

The development kit comes with necessary software including InvenSense MotionLink, a GUI based development tool and embedded Motion Drivers for ICM-20948.

I downloaded their library but i need a guide of programming it!

So my question is there anyone that worked with this kit and can provide me a good guide or info that would help me to even start understanding how to work with this DK.

There are two methods of storage of anhydrous ammonia: refrigerated atmospheric tank or pressurized tank in a pressure temperature equilibrium. This question can apply to both but we have the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

No code or standard specifically requires the use of an intermediate inerting gas when emptying and purging the tank for inspection and maintenance. 

&amp;#x200B;

FLAMMABLE LIMITS OF VAPOR IN AIR:	LEL/UEL 16% to 25% (listed in the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards 15% to 28%).

&amp;#x200B;

AUTO IGNITION TEMPERATURE:	1,204 °F (If catalyzed). 1,570 °F (If un-catalyzed).

But, because of explosive range of anhydrous ammonia, some companies decide to use nitrogen as an inerting gas. Others decide not to.  

My opinion and the opinion of many others: inerting is not required because there is no ignition source inside a storage tank or piping.  I even saw one company that said ""It's not required, but we do it anyway"" and they specified it in their procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other notes:

The only “explosions” on record are inside buildings (ammonia refrigeration facilities) with ignition sources, and those are super rare with only 1 documented case that I know of.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s impossible to get to 16% unless it’s an enclosed space.  Even a dense gas cloud from a major liquid leak will still be below the explosive range.  I learned this in training but cannot find it written anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ammonia safety is managed by:

\-OSHA Standard 1910.111 Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

\-ANSI K61.1 now CGA G-2 Anhydrous Ammonia Standard

Neither of these say inerting with an intermediate gas is required, but they do not say it is not required.

&amp;#x200B;

I need it to be both accurate and precise as these parts need to connect to each other and to other things that are themselves very accurate.

Where am I at? Well I'm not looking for comment on this quest without trying some stuff first, here's my past two weeks:

I've learned openscad and i'm cranking out variations of my shape like there's no tomorrow, digitally my product is ace.

I've slapped a 0.25mm nozzle on my prusa mk3, tightened up my belts, and built up a mountain of plastic rejects.
I've also managed to fairly consistently print my part tho, by tweaking both the slicing and the openscad design to avoid movements that seem to cause the greatest variances in printing runs, and trying a bunch of different filaments. Nylon was too floppy, PLA was the best for rigidity but PETG overall gave me the best results, slightly less rigid than pla at 0.3mm but good enough and more consistent tolerances across prints.
But ultimately at those tolerances I think I've hit the limits of this particular fdm printer.
it's an awesome printer, getting it this far has made me really appreciate it, it's so close to printing my ridiculously small part, but it's not quite there.

I've just today sent my stl to shapeways and treatstock, with 1mm sprues thrown around the 0.3mm parts to pass the automated checks but i'm half expecting them to reject it during manual checks tho.

i've even ordered some casting resin and i've started reading up about silicon moulds, but TBH I'm not sure how i go from stl to mould and i very much want to drive this off my openscad project so maybe this will sit in my garage next to that cement I bought a while back because i thought i'd make something out of that too.

I've also started looking at the anycubic photon or maybe the prusa sl1 and am seriously considering ordering one or the other. i've even eyed up the form 3 but £3k is a ton of dough to drop so i'd want to know fo sho it would work for me. maybe i'll order a part off treatstock from someone with a form 3...
I also looked at an ultralight3d altraspin but €150k is a bit steep :(

I'm hoping for suggestions of how i can prototype this really, really small part at the tolerances i need without spending loads of ££££/€€€€/$$$$.

Are there tricks to get this thing successfully printed by a service like shapeways or treatstock or i.materialise at those tolerances? sprues? cages? some exotic thing i've not discovered in the past 2 weeks of trying to figure this out? I've attempted an order so i'll report back but keen to hear others experiences while i wait. Maybe there's a service that specialises in small parts and tight tolerances?

Should I get a anycubic photon or a prusa sl1? or... a form 3? I mean not just because they'd be cool to have, could they actually print this thing precisely and accurately? and if they can why are the online services that use them failing my stl on automated checks without sprues?

cnc a negative mould? laser cut a thing that's already 0.3mm thick? ask on another subreddit?

it&amp;#39;s an awesome printer, getting it this far has made me really appreciate it, it&amp;#39;s so close to printing my ridiculously small part, but it&amp;#39;s not quite there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just today sent my stl to shapeways and treatstock, with 1mm sprues thrown around the 0.3mm parts to pass the automated checks but i&amp;#39;m half expecting them to reject it during manual checks tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;ve even ordered some casting resin and i&amp;#39;ve started reading up about silicon moulds, but TBH I&amp;#39;m not sure how i go from stl to mould and i very much want to drive this off my openscad project so maybe this will sit in my garage next to that cement I bought a while back because i thought i&amp;#39;d make something out of that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also started looking at the anycubic photon or maybe the prusa sl1 and am seriously considering ordering one or the other. i&amp;#39;ve even eyed up the form 3 but £3k is a ton of dough to drop so i&amp;#39;d want to know fo sho it would work for me. maybe i&amp;#39;ll order a part off treatstock from someone with a form 3...
I also looked at an ultralight3d altraspin but €150k is a bit steep :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping for suggestions of how i can prototype this really, really small part at the tolerances i need without spending loads of ££££/€€€€/$$$$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there tricks to get this thing successfully printed by a service like shapeways or treatstock or i.materialise at those tolerances? sprues? cages? some exotic thing i&amp;#39;ve not discovered in the past 2 weeks of trying to figure this out? I&amp;#39;ve attempted an order so i&amp;#39;ll report back but keen to hear others experiences while i wait. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a service that specialises in small parts and tight tolerances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I get a anycubic photon or a prusa sl1? or... a form 3? I mean not just because they&amp;#39;d be cool to have, could they actually print this thing precisely and accurately? and if they can why are the online services that use them failing my stl on automated checks without sprues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cnc a negative mould? laser cut a thing that&amp;#39;s already 0.3mm thick? ask on another subreddit?
something i&amp;#39;ve not thought of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying to build a mid-drive by myself. I  have worked out some calculations and now have the amount of torque and  RPM I need. I need help choosing a proper motor for the build. I am not  sure about the calculations being right so please do points out  mistakes if any. The power restrictions for my area is 250W and my build  should stay within this limit.

I''m assuming the total weight of the bike including the rider, battery and motor to be 105kgs. My max speed will be 25kmh.

I calculated the Air Resistance using the formula:

    RA = rhoCDAV^2/2 where RA is the Air Resistance, rho is density of air and A is area under contact in m^2 and v is velocity in m/s 
    RA = 1.225*0.88*0.4*6.94*6.94/2 
    RA = 10.38N 

I calculated the Rolling Resistance using the formula:

    RR = GVW*Crr where RR is the Rolling Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and Crr is co-eff of rolling friction which is 0.004 for bicycle tire and asphalt roads 
    RR = 1030.05*0.004 
    RR = 4.12N 

I calculated the Grade Resistance using the formula:

    RG = GVW*sin theta where RG is the Grade Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and sin theta is 0.196 for a grade of 20% 
    RG = 1030.05*0.196 
    RA = 202.09N

Acceleration force required to achieve 25kmh in 5sec with the GVW of 105kg is **145.74N**

The total torque required including the grade resistance is **83.6Nm**

The torque required on flat roads is **37.15Nm**

The RPM required to achieve 25kmh after considering a fudge factor of 20% is **240**

Now since it is a mid-drive the motor must be small, high torque motors  are bigger. So the best solution is to use a high rpm motor and use gear  reduction to achieve the required torque levels.Am I correct? I need help on choosing the right motor and gear reduction. I'm planning to use a 36V 10A controller so the peak power can be 306W...

(I'm asking this here because I now there's a lot of engineers from the UK in this subreddit, and in the r/AskUK the bots always remove my post, as they somehow think this post is about Brexit).

For some time now I'm being contacted by some engineering outsourcing company in the UK starting in ""Al"" and ending in ""en"". It's a global company, the overall reviews in Glassdoor are awful and I've had a negative interview experience with these guys already twice, in 2 different countries. To say that I'm less than impressed is an understatement.

The only reason I'd come to work for these guys is for A LOT of money.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 4yrs experience, and I'm currently living and working in Belgium. It's a quite nice country, life quality here is high. I'm a permanent employee of the company, so none of that temp crap these type of companies offer. I speak 3 languages well, 1 OK and I'm learning a 5th one.

I'm passively looking, but my job situation is stable and well paid. I'm paid around 55k€ (gross) in Belgium.

What is the largest amount of money that I can ask these guys that they can borderline offer me?

**I want to pass the message that:**

- Me changing jobs will cost you a premium, I don't really need to change

- Leaving the EU for a country that's undergoing a volatile period will cost you a premium (I can put my things in my car tomorrow and go for any of the EU countries I want)

- Going from a perm employee in an OK company to a temp in a shitty outsourcing company will cost you a premium (throughout my career I've seen a lot of temps get sacked when things get rough)

- The £ has been steadily declining against the €, and that (you've guessed it) will cost you a premium

My family has always struggled with money, and as an adult, I want to be in a position of financial stability. I don't foresee that happening if I am making less than $60,000 by the time I am 30 years old. I then started looking at engineering degrees, and have found that they tend to be more employable and higher paying than almost all environmental science degrees. I have always enjoyed creating and problem solving. I have also had little trouble with my math and science classes in high school (I did take honors and AP level classes). Part of me is thinking this may be the direction I want to go in. All of this setup leads me to my questions:

1) Is there an engineering degree that incorporates environmental sustainability? I know about environmental engineering, but am not quite sure what that would entail. Is environmental engineering what I am looking for? I have heard some people on r/engineering call it a fake degree. Is that true? Is it comparable with other engineering degrees as far as employment and salary are concerned? Are there better engineering degree options? Is a Master's degree necessary to do well in this field?

2) What steps should I start taking now, as a student who has yet to begin my college journey, to make sure that I am heading down the right path. What are some things I should already start preparing for (classes, internships, etc...)?

This is my first time really considering this pathway, so I apologize if some of the things I have said are ill-informed or ignorant. Also, if there are some things I have not disclosed that you need to know in order to help me out, I also apologize. If you have questions for me in the comments, I will try my best to answer them. I hope my post wasn't too long winded, there is just a lot I would like to learn and consider. Thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is my situation. I just graduated high school. I live in California. I am attending a local community college to save money, and then plan to transfer to a four year university (ideally after two years). Up until this point, I was thinking about getting a degree in the field of environmental science. The main reason for me wanting to enter this field, as childish as it may sound, was because AP environmental science was the course I enjoyed the most in high school.

I got two centrifugal pumps, both have their own flow meter, connected in same network, series.

It's a pipe network with multiple outlets. But only one outlet is open at the same time.

Some of the outlets runs fine, steady state flow, perfect to control.

But two of the pipes the flow isn't steady, and it can go from 38 m3/h to 50 m3/h in a split second.

I got the problem with both pumps and both flow transmitters.

When I look at the outlet of the pipes I can't see any drastic change in the water flow.

We don't have the problem in pipes that require less pressure head, and we don't have problems in pipes that require more pressure head.

So I've been out of school for 2.5 years, and working for 1.5 years. I studied mechanical engineering, but towards the end I gained a fascination with programming, data science, etc. I kind of self taught myself the basics of python during my time looking for a job, where I finally got hired into a role that was primarily of civil design. I did not care for it, and it bored me to death. I did have one project though, that was mechanical in nature (natural gas flowrate verification), and involved programming in VBA, and I absolutely loved it. This project lasted about 9 months, and then I was solely on the civil design projects again, and I was beginning to dread going to work. So I started looking for data science/analyst jobs, in addition to mechanical engineering jobs. 

While at my original firm, I began talking through LinkedIn with a senior data scientist at a local internet startup that has absolutely blown up over the last 10 years. I had seen they had a machine learning engineer on Indeed. I reached out and explained my situation. He seemed fairly interested in me, gave me some advice, even invited me to lunch with he and his supervisor (my job was 2 hours away from my hometown so this was tough). He also sent their hiring assessment for data scientists. He said no rush and to just have fun with it since they don't currently have any entry level positions, but were interested in me anyways. Felt they could teach me everything skill wise, just can't teach hard work, acceptance of failure, teamwork etc. 

Fast forward a few weeks (January or so of this year), and I had spent a little bit of time working on the assessment, and I got an interview request for a fortune 500 company in a mechanical engineering role. I went and interviewed, got the job, and started in March.

While it is infinitely more interesting than the last job, at least the civil design work, I'm already bored. The work isn't difficult, which might be part of the problem, as I don't feel challenged like during the VBA project. I'm doing some training about PRA, and while it's not super in depth, it just barely scratches the surface on the programming/logic/etc and makes me realize that it is what I want to do. I need to do it. There's no way I can see myself doing what my job currently entails, or anything similar to it, for the rest of my career. 

Has anyone ever switched from any engineering discipline to data science/data analyst/machine learning, etc?

Should I wait and spend more time here at my current company? I spent just barely over a year at my first firm, and have only been here for 4 months. 

Due to the rapid nature of the interview process and kind of being thrown into the fire at the new company, the assessment for the data position had slipped my mind. Would it be weird to just send it in if I were to finish it up as it has been a few days?

Well, lunch break is over. Thanks for any input!

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been out of school for 2.5 years, and working for 1.5 years. I studied mechanical engineering, but towards the end I gained a fascination with programming, data science, etc. I kind of self taught myself the basics of python during my time looking for a job, where I finally got hired into a role that was primarily of civil design. I did not care for it, and it bored me to death. I did have one project though, that was mechanical in nature (natural gas flowrate verification), and involved programming in VBA, and I absolutely loved it. This project lasted about 9 months, and then I was solely on the civil design projects again, and I was beginning to dread going to work. So I started looking for data science/analyst jobs, in addition to mechanical engineering jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at my original firm, I began talking through LinkedIn with a senior data scientist at a local internet startup that has absolutely blown up over the last 10 years. I had seen they had a machine learning engineer on Indeed. I reached out and explained my situation. He seemed fairly interested in me, gave me some advice, even invited me to lunch with he and his supervisor (my job was 2 hours away from my hometown so this was tough).

Trying to figure out the best mixing scheme for a container which might be best to think of as 2 dimensional. Imagine this bag is rectangular with the long side vertically oriented. Also imagine the container is being held in place by a pinching mechanism which blocks approximately 1/2 the diameter through the middle of the container. Imagine 1 fluid is flowing into this container through the bottom, and a pressure is being exerted on the bottom of the container, which deforms to push the fluid upward in a pulsating motion.

What are some good 2D mixing schemes to build into this container in order to mix the incoming liquid?

Here's an idea of mine for an example: pinch the 2 sides around the pinching block in order to induce turbulent flow around both sides of the block. Use concave-down parabolic ridges in the container to funnel these turbulent streams into each other.

Wish I could be less vague about this, but I cannot.

Reason: I'm currently in the industry as a contractor working in project controls. Working in the US, on-site, on projects, my all-in day rate is in the $900's a day (take home pre taxes, based on 10hr day w/ PD).

Additionally, I'd like to increase my income potential during times I work regular hours (not the usual 6 days a week 10hrs + for months on end). To do this I plan on returning to school to get my mechanical engineering degree and maybe work my way into petroleum engineering. The backup plan to that is making my way to project manager at an Energy or EPC company, I have most of the qualifications minus the engineering degree (seems to be my hangup). I already have an MBA and the PMP certification plus 10 yrs of field experience. What I don't know, is if I will go through all of this effort to end up making the same income I do now, or whether there's a bigger upside on the engineering side. Based on my knowledge rates/cost, I'd assume I can nearly double (or at least 1.5x) my income potential through engineering in the oil and gas industry, but I have nothing concrete.

A little information:

The fridge/freezer in this unit will run on propane or electricity.

It's currently being powered by electricity, 120v grid tie.

I'm here by myself, so there's not a lot of stuff in the fridge or freezer, ie, thats a lot of empty space in both.

What additional information would be required to answer this question?  Also, I'm using two bottles of water and rotating them back and forth.  As the one in the fridge becomes liquid again, I move it back to the freezer and move the forzen one into the fridge.

How often the well water is cycled into the pressure tank(s). 
Finding a radiator material that is drinking water safe.
How much waste energy can be stored in X amount of 36-37*F water?

Why not incorporate piezoelectric materials in the design of suspension joints of cars, like struts, shocks, springs, engine mounts etc

Or why not even tires? Put some piezo elements in the treads. You could have a dozen piezo discs touching the ground at the same time per tire (piezo discs are small) which would add up nicely and feed power back to battery to help prolong charge.

Altogether by being in the suspension and tires I believe it would be a significant amount of electricity and cumulatively assist the battery’s charge.

Quartz is a piezoelectric material that is quite abundant and cheap.

Galfenol is not piezoelectric but generates electricity under a magnetic field and extreme stress. Galfenol ideal for incorporating into shock/struts or brake caliper design by engineers to add to battery power?

I'm hoping you all can help me out. I've been in this job since I graduated about 6 years ago. It pays pretty well, I'm right around $80K in the Midwest area, which I don't think sucks too bad.

To attempt to make a long story short, I'm experiencing some SERIOUS burn out in my job.

It's damn near my dream job. I'm working in my field (material science/engineering), and I used to love it. It's manufacturing. 

Recently, I've had more and more added to my plate. It's gotten to the point where basically, I feel like I'm failing at everything. I used to succeed in a big way. I really found my stride and I felt like I was good at my job. I got a promotion, but, nobody was hired to replace my old job, so I've kept those responsibilities. Now, like I said, I no longer feel successful. I feel like I have so many #1 priority things to do that I don't have the time to do any of them well, so, I do all of them poorly.

Originally I blamed myself and poor work habits. I bought a planner, tried my hardest to get more organized, knock out more little things that I seemed to keep forgetting etc.

But that didn't work for long. For a short while I felt like I was making progress. Eventually I was overwhelmed again.

I've found I'm consistently working ~50 hour weeks. I go home feeling absolutely drained. Even after a long weekend or some time out of work, I'll come in feeling refreshed and within hours it's all wiped away.

I even got talked to once for not checking my emails on the weekends. When I said any email could wait until Monday (granted, it was publicly and in not the best tone), I was told I came off as not committed. When I asked how work got done before emails could be checked at home, I was told ""We had more people then."" Which honestly just made me feel like they don't want to hire what's needed so they want me to work extra hours for no more pay.

I talked to HR and my supervisor about it, saying I will be quitting if things don't change soon. They've *said* they hear me and will be getting me more resources or something but...I don't know. I'm not seeing change very fast.

But, before I seriously play the card of ""I'm outta here"" with my dream job that I used to *love*, I figured I'd ask around.

Is this what I should expect? Particularly in manufacturing? I'd hate to leave a job in a field I enjoy only to find it's like this everywhere and I need to completely change my career plan.

Currently I'm doing MEP consulting, and I'm not enjoying it as I don't find the work interesting, so I want to switch. I want to do something with RF systems since I'm actually very interested in this field. After talking to friends/profs/professionals in this field, they all agreed my best next step to get into RF is to do a master's, so I'm planning on going back in September 2020 (a master's is something I want anyways, so I'm kinda dead set in doing it, and I feel like if I push it off any later than 2020 I'm going to end up not doing it at all) 

I've been in contact with another company, this one doing embedded systems, and they want to bring me in for an interview. Embedded systems still isn't exactly what I want to do, but I think I would be happier doing that. 

My issue is that even if I do get the job, I'm still fully intending on leaving to go back to school in a year, so I'll only have 6 months of experience in power and a year of embedded systems - I feel like if I do this I've basically wasted all the time between my schooling since I'll hardly get any real experience at either company. I'm also worried if I do this that I'll be seen as someone who jumps ship every 6 months, and that might turn some employers away.

Summary: don't like my job of 6 months, thinking of switching but would be leaving after a year, worried this might look bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I've graduated anywhere between 18 months and 24ish months ago. I am not exactly sure when my official graduation date is, because I defended my final year project in May, but had to do a resit in August, and got my diploma at the end of November that same year(bachelors MEng). Again, not exactly sure what my official graduation date is, so I'd appreciate if someone could shed a light.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, after defending my project successfully I was absolutely burned out and in complete state of dread that I've failed my degree. This lasted until the middle of June, at which point I started to face more pressing issues - almost no money, no job, no prospect of a graduate job considering I didnt even know what my diploma would be (ended up with a 2:1, only didnt get compensation for a first because of the resit that was 1/24 of the total credits for the year).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At that point I was struggling to even get a reply for non skilled jobs and I was really desperate. Around middle of July I started working nights in a warehouse and stayed there until the end of the year.It was literally the only job I got an interview for. The job was absolutely devastating, extremely labour intensive,55 hours a week and I had to cycle for an hour and a half every day to and from work.Last 9 kilograms during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the following year I had to take a month off after quitting because of exhaustion and tried to get into the graduate job hunting process again , but the measly savings I had were quickly running out and I found myself jobhunting for any type of job again without much success.Realistically I spend a 5 weeks recovering Jan-Feb, and 6 or so weeks trying to refresh my knowledge from university(managed to even build up a small portfolio of CAD drawings, but had no success with applications, not that I was confident enough to send out that many resumes). At the end of April that year I started another warehouse job, nights again, better conditions. However, in July my partner had to leave me alone in the flat so she could finish her degree, and after she came back in October she struggled to get a job. Essentially I was the single earner in the household until around Christmas and had to face all bills and rent alone, meaning I was doing quite a lot of overtime.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Got laid off 10 days ago from the current warehouse and now I am trying to make some sense of what has happened this past year and a half and how this could impact me. In all honestly, time flows differently when you're working nights and it is just now that I realise how much time has passed....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the big question is - is there any hope for finding a graduate job? Assuming I make it to interviews ( currently revising/doing aptitude test training, etc) do you think hiring managers will be understanding to my situation or will this massive gap be something I wont be able to overcome?

&amp;#x200B;

Before you ask - no internships. Applied and got offers in my third year, but didnt have 2-3k for flights to China...

Wasnt able to actively seek out opportunities in the final year because I was really struggling. The previous two years I had to work part time nights and this impacted me very negatively  in the fourth year, because I've had to skip classes due to work in years two and three, which meant I had to work extra hard to pass my exams and finish my project during the final year. In the end the hard work did pay off, as my project received excellent marks and got an ImechE award for it, but thats about the only positive thing I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

No interships;

Had to get shitty jobs after graduating;

1.5-2 years have passed;

How fucked am I?

In all honestly, time flows differently when you&amp;#39;re working nights and it is just now that I realise how much time has passed....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the big question is - is there any hope for finding a graduate job? Assuming I make it to interviews ( currently revising/doing aptitude test training, etc) do you think hiring managers will be understanding to my situation or will this massive gap be something I wont be able to overcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you ask - no internships. Applied and got offers in my third year, but didnt have 2-3k for flights to China...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasnt able to actively seek out opportunities in the final year because I was really struggling. The previous two years I had to work part time nights and this impacted me very negatively  in the fourth year, because I&amp;#39;ve had to skip classes due to work in years two and three, which meant I had to work extra hard to pass my exams and finish my project during the final year. In the end the hard work did pay off, as my project received excellent marks and got an ImechE award for it, but thats about the only positive thing I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No interships;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to get shitty jobs after graduating;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.5-2 years have passed;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How fucked am I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice will be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I work in the Bay Area, so defense work is serenely underpaid compared to tech with no RSUs for anyone of normal status. I am making just under 100k with 1.5 years of experience.

I use to be a very quick thinker and what I use to think clever... now I feel I don&amp;#39;t think at all. Everyone tells me I need to leave otherwise it will become worse and I may develop permanent memory and thinking problems. &lt;/p&gt;

Now, I was planning to take a second degree which is Civil engineering after I graduate. Civil Eng&amp;#39;g was my childhood dream but because of my impulsive decision , I realized that I made a mistake (I am a dumbest,stupid,idiot person right?)  and I decided that I should try to follow my passion. I think this is what they called Quarter life crisis. Do you think it is reasonable to take a second undergraduate degree?
Any advice or opinion will be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

Then just weld the two shut or some other method to keep them together?” 

The premise behind this is that I thought if you took an engine (preferably cast iron) bore the cylinders out to some crazy amount, and then essentially chop off all the excess metal until what’s left is the outer shells of where each piston would sit inside, then you could isolate each cylinder, and thus cool each cylinder entirely by running coolant in the space between each cylinder, without them transferring heat directly to each other since the space would be liquid keeping it cooled instead of metal keeping the heat trapped within the center? I’m not sure if that makes sense or not, but yea. And to encase it, you could use an alluminum shell which should lower the weight right? 

Basically imagine each cylinder being built like a line of outdoor coolers. Whereas with a cooler you have a vacuum in between the inner and outer shell, in this you’d have coolant. 

You know, now that I think about it, perhaps this is how engines are already manufactured? I’m not entirely sure since I’ve never really looked into it, and from what it seems, the space in between cylinders always seems like it was a solid chunk of metal that they simply bored a line of holes into lol.

The client is replacing one of their tunnel washers.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is as follows: The exhaust ductwork for the room and related sterilizing equipment (the HVAC system is a once through system) is running in the 150F-200F range with high humidity (at least 30% possibly much higher). The system is exhausting \~8000 CFM. There is 200' ( with a 90' rise) of un-insulated ductwork to the point of discharge. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition particulate matter (rat urine, feces and bedding material) from the equipment being washed is being carried up into the ductwork. This is causing the condensate to become acidic. The duct is condensing a *significant* amount of water. The estimate is at least 10 gallons an hour. So the interior of the stainless steel ductwork is being pin holed and leaking. Any weld points not passivated are chewed through. As a stop gap the client has been epoxy coating the bottom six inches of the ductwork to prevent corrosion, but any joints are still being chewed through.

&amp;#x200B;

We do not have a current T&amp;B report with flows, temperatures or humidity levels (the architect is trying to schedule with ownership to get the T&amp;B guy in).

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the issue is this air temp/humidity is way off the normal areas that the psychrometic charts cover. I did enough digging to figure out the energy loads I am dealing with. Assume the saturation curve at these temperatures is nearly vertical.

&amp;#x200B;

The client would understandably like the ducts to stop raining. the options we are looking at include: 

Complete epoxy coat of the exiting ductwork.  

Factory epoxy coating (or anything better) of of replacement ductwork.   

Insulate all exposed ductwork. Unfortunately the 90' riser is in a fire rated shaft and the expense is prohibitive.

Pitch the ductwork to drain back to the tunnel washer.    

Find a way to control the moisture. We are willing to look at heat exchangers to draw down the air temperature and wring water out at specific points in the ductwork. We are willing to reheat the air to get off the saturation curve.   

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody know of coating options that work on stainless steel, work in high temperature, high humidity environments that are acidic, tolerate the welding crew welding the ducts together and can be field applied in areas where welding occurred?

Computer Engineer major here. Bit of a read so bare with me :) (tl;dr at the bottom but be better to read the details)

Major: Computer EngineerEducation: UndergradLocation: New York City

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the situation. I was suppose to be graduating this fall, but I wasn't able to get a seat in Senior Design this past semester. My friend had an internship here in NYC for the Department of Ed as IT (paid, 16 an hour). He suggested I go for it. I figured since I have to wait to Spring 2020 to graduate now, maybe it would not be a bad idea. I wasn't able to really secure internships during my studies.

The issue is this. It requires 15 hours a minimum a week. It's not a lot, the issue is my schedule doesn't really work. I'm currently stuck in school Mon/Wed's 9am-6:30pm with a gap, and I have max commute time of 3 hours a day. The job's available hours a day is 8am-3pm. It would be ridiculous to commute 1-1.5 hrs back home to work an hour, then come back to school 1-1.5 hrs to travel, then come home again. Tu/Thur same issue. Friday is the only free day.

My current schedule I am trying to get rid of the 9am class cause its not even a class I want to take. I have two track electives to take and senior design (also a liberal art), and I wanted to take electives that interested me, but if I do, the work load will be a lot (not sure if doable with the internship. I read it's 20+programming assignments in the semester along with projects). There's another class that's more laid back, ""Numerical Issues in Scientific Programming"" which doesn't peak my interest much, but again its more laid back of a workload.

I also currently work as a Tutor.

I've also heard IT doesn't really look good for engineers on their resumes. Not sure if there's a lot of truth to it. Also my friend said he really didn't even do much, there was nothing to do unless a teacher had an issue connecting wifi or something like that.

**tl;dr Should I take electives that I'm less/not interested in, in order to possibly do an internship, that I may not get anything out of, just to show ""internship"" on my resume (even though I heard IT doesn't look good for engineers)? I already work as a tutor and try to do projects for my resume.**

First a little background: Mechanical Engineering graduate May 2019. Shy and very introverted.

I am desperately looking for a job. I had an interview at socal gas in march and havent heard from them since.

I have a final round interview coming up at Kiewit for a office/field engineer.

Yesterday (while I was on a phone interview with Kiewit) I received a phone call from Raytheon. This phone call was from a woman asking me if I was interested in a position I didn't apply for. (I applied for a mechanical engineering position) She said the position is a whole life engineer position. (I linked the job description below) I told her yes and she said she would contact me next week to set up an interview.

Today Kiewit called me back to invite me for an in person interview as soon as I accepted and hung up Raytheon called me and invited me for an in person interview.

Seems like the good lord is really trying to prevent me from working for Kiewit.

I am hesitant about going to the interview. The way I see is ... I can make a lot of money in construction and can grow pretty fast. Although I am starting in a position that doesn't really use my degree I can use it as a stepping stone to make work my way into HVAC, Edison, DWP, even the city ... where I ultimately want to be. 

My questions are:

What would you do? 

God forbid either market crashes which one would go first? Construction or a department of defense contractor?

Would it be easier to jump into construction from aerospace or aerospace from construction if the either market would take a shit

Have you ever heard of this Whole Life Engineer position? I have an understanding of what the position entails but what does the position actually do? ( the word software is thrown around a lot and I absolutely hate hate hate coding)

Raytheon has a pretty crappy reputation as far as growth goes. Does anyone have some insight about this? (worried because I am such a shy person. ..... if a telemarketer calls I will stay on the phone to listen to their whole speech because I am just to shy to be confrontational)

Kiewit also has a pretty shitty reputation about work life balance which is why I am leaning more toward Raytheon. 

Sorry ... I am all over the place.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First a little background: Mechanical Engineering graduate May 2019. Shy and very introverted.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello fellow redditors

Long  story short I built a CNC machine (entirely from gantry table to  electronics) following the instructions of the book ""CNC Robotics"" by  Geoff Williams.

My  problem is that it is extremely slow, as per the steps I followed I  connected the stepper motors to a PC power supply to provide them 12V  each.

My stepper motors are rated to up to 48V @ 4Amps, the CNC circuit boards can handle up to 36V @2Amps each.

My  current setup is the following:I have 2 PC Power sources, each power  source has 2 terminals, each terminal has 4 wires (5V, Ground, Ground  &amp; 12V).

I'm using 3 out of these 4 terminals to feed each of my circuit boards.

I  figured, given I have 3 terminals, if I hook up the 12V cables in  series I could get 36V, however, when I tested it out, I got 0V from 2  terminals of the same power source, I'm guessing I pretty much short  circuited it, which I half expected this...

Weird  thing is, when I connected in series the 2 terminals from different  power sources I still got 12V: I was really expecting 24V here, not sure  what happened, I connected the +12VDC of the first terminal to Ground  of the 2nd terminal and I connected my multimeter to the Ground of the  first terminal and Positive of 2nd terminal, I guess when it comes to  power sources connecting in series like this does not fly?

Anywho...  how could I get 36V, do I need transformers? if so this is kinda  advanced for me, any nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow redditors&lt;/p&gt;

I just graduated from CU Denver with a physics bachelors and I am currently looking for a job. My original plan was to go to graduate school and become a physicist, but late in my education, I decided that I didn't want to do that.  I'm much more interested in engineering now (a little late :( , I know). I'm thinking of taking another semester or two of classes in engineering courses to expand my skill set and I'm wondering what kind of classes would be most important to take and what kind of skills I might be able to teach myself.

What I know:

Mathematics:

Calculus, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, Partial Differential Equations, Laplace Transforms, Fourier Transforms, Statistics, Numerical Methods

Physics:

Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian mechanics

E/M statics/dynamics, E/M waves, circuits, materials

Thermodynamics

The other stuff that's not applicable with a BS

Coding:

C/C#/C++, Python, R, bash, FORTRAN, OOP

What I'd like to learn:

Electronics

Embedded Systems

more with Materials

CAD

Fluids

Since the sheet is thin/flimsy, I was thinking of covering these slots first with expanded metal and then attaching the steel mesh to that metal. But I don’t know how I can attach it?

Hey all. Im a recent mechanical engineering grad. I enjoyed my education and liked the technical stuff, but I had a few internships that kept me inside behind a desk, often with not enough work to stay busy. I also didn’t love going through complicated situations and calculations during work, so didn’t love the really technical stuff that I wasn’t very confident in. Because of this I sorta thought I needed a career change. I am now working at a software company and interfacing with clients and not using any of my technical skills (been here 4 weeks).

I know 4 weeks isn’t enough to feel a company out and I’m sorta still in training, but I really feel that in my gut this isn’t where I belong and I won’t be happy here. I have a couple related questions.

1. I’ve sorta narrowed down what I want for my long term position. I think I want to end up doing some field work and some office work, and interfacing with people in a less formal way. Because of this I see myself in a sortof construction project management position. Are there any positions that come to mind when you hear: flexible hours (come in early and beat traffic, get work done, leave in 8 hours), comfortable and not overly formal environment (right now I have a pretty strict formal dress code, I’m not really into that or the environment that comes with it), interesting and not incredibly technical work (think more conceptual and less calculation types of work)? Do you think there’s anything I’m really skipping over?

2. Because this job is so new to me and I’m getting the feeling I won’t last here all that long, what are your thoughts on how long it is appropriate to stay here before leaving? I have heard at least a year, but if asked in an interview why I’m leaving I will say I spent some time here and I could tell it wasn’t what I wanted to do. So why would it only make sense to stay a year if I knew immediately I wasn’t a good fit. (To be clear, I do not by any means think it’s acceptable for me to leave now, I need to stay for some time until I completely feel out the position).

3. I’m making a pretty good salary, but in a non related industry. If I switch from this job to another, is my previous pay relevant at all to what I might get paid?

Do you think there’s anything I’m really skipping over?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this job is so new to me and I’m getting the feeling I won’t last here all that long, what are your thoughts on how long it is appropriate to stay here before leaving? I have heard at least a year, but if asked in an interview why I’m leaving I will say I spent some time here and I could tell it wasn’t what I wanted to do. So why would it only make sense to stay a year if I knew immediately I wasn’t a good fit. (To be clear, I do not by any means think it’s acceptable for me to leave now, I need to stay for some time until I completely feel out the position).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m making a pretty good salary, but in a non related industry. If I switch from this job to another, is my previous pay relevant at all to what I might get paid?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

A SCUBA tank can be pressurized to around 3,000 psi, and commonly available impact drivers can put out some decent torque, which I can only assume can be toned down with the regulator or gearing if needed.

What I'm finding is that apparently no one has tried and documented such a setup, which leads me to believe that it's got some flaw that I haven't considered.

I don't mind that it would be rather loud, I don't care that it will be pretty rough on the impact drivers internals, and I don't really care about the effective range; this is purely a novelty idea.

The impact driver acts as both the motor and a clutch (sort of) and can be engaged with a very simple cable setup, a sprocket welded to the driver, and a second chain fixed to one of the sprockets on the cassette.

i know it's unrealistic, but the concept is to make a pipe in the wing and guide the air flow to offset the air coming from the area below the wing.

anyway i made a 3d model for it and had it analyzed int by ANSYS, but the results doesn't seem right. air goes straight past the wing as if the wing doesn't exist.

i actually got a isolated area warning by cfx, but made it ignore it.

The 10 Inch DC fan is very old and has the capability to be battery operated, its motor is very small (like 10 times smaller than the AC fan), also the back of the AC fan gets warm to the touch with all the airflow going going around it. So I started reading and found this paper:

https://escholarship.org/uc/item/98n759dr

It compares the efficiency of a table fan vs computer fans, and found that with 7W of computer fans you get about the same cooling as with a 20W desk fan.

So why do AC fans have such a terrible efficiency? How can I figure out its efficiency? I tested removing the blades from the fan and turning it on, and without blades the power draws only drops from 40W to 33W. So that means that only 7W are used to blow air? Does it have to do with the type of motor or is it just the result of cheap manufacturing?

I also just took apart the fan with the DC motor, and measured the power draw of the motor directly, it draws 1.8A at 4.7V (8.5W!!), the rest is lost in its power supply.

**SHORT VERSION:**  2-3 years out of undergrad with B.S. in Biochem. Have been working in a high profile biophysics/biohem lab full time. I'm on a great projectory (stacked experiences, high impact paper, made up for low GPA, some connections through PI) to getting into top tier Biophysics/biochem PhD programs. Always have had interest in space exploration/engineering. Loved physics/good at math. But also loving what I'm currently doing. Now torn between going to a top program for PhD in biophyics/biochem or starting over and becoming an engineer in possibly a mediocre program. Wondering if i'm just romanticizing the space exploration/engineering route? Is the job lackluster (i've seen many different opinions when looking around)? What are some ways of getting into engineering for non-engineers? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

Graduated from a University of California in Biochemistry  2-3 years ago with a GPA of 2.97 (so close to 3.0...) and major GPA of \~3.3. Since graduation, I have been working full time in a biophysics/biochem lab at a top tier research university with a young rising star PI who has published many high profile/impact papers. The work experience has been awesome and the unbelievable training I've received from my PI/other lab members, in addition to co-authoring on a high impact paper and another smaller paper, has landed me on a great path to (hopefully) get into a top program in biophysics/biochem and/or related field.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always loved physics, was good at math, and had an interest in engineering and loved space exploration. The thought of working in the space industry has always given me rush of excitement and thrill. After not being able to join the college of engineering (CoE) at my university as an undergrad (didn't know i had to apply for the CoE from the beginning and i could not transfer over), i decided to go down the Biochemistry route (i also loved chemistry as a kid). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now 2-3 years after graduating from undergrad, I am looking into Biophysics/biochem PhD programs. However, my interest in engineering came back after watching some NASA videos and as I looked into engineering programs, i found that it was not too late. I found things such as Masters in Engineering programs for non-engineers (Boston University LEAP program, although it may be too expensive and far away for my own liking). Or even going back to community college to take engineering classes (and aim to do very well) and then applying for more traditional Master programs in engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now torn between these two choices. Biophysics/Biochem still greatly intrigues me and I have been loving what I do. Though there are small caveats such as the research sometimes being less tangible (but still very interesting) and that PhD programs will take 5-6 years before starting my career. It would also be hard to give up the Biophysics/biochem route especially when I'm en route to (hopefully) getting into a great programs/school for possibly getting into a mediocre/okay engineering program, AFTER a year of course make up at local community college (unless i find an accelerated master's program for non-engineers in California).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering to myself, is this engineering dream just a dream? Will the job itself be less fulfilling than I imagine it to be? I've been doing a lot of research around sub-reddits and see many people say the industry is too slow/bureaucratic/feels like being a small cog in a big machine and a lot of paperwork, which is turning me off a bit. Though I'm sure there are exciting parts too. 

I wonder if i am giving up on something great I currently enjoy/have for something i'm romanticizing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way i'm still very interested in both paths and would love advice from people who have similar experiences. Or if you're an engineer in this field and have a comment or two, that would be much appreciated as well!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

What are the best ways for a non-engineer to get a degree in engineering? Community college, then apply for traditional masters? Masters for non-engineers? Are there other options? I also read you should never pay for a master's in engineering. Should always look for companies to fund you, though I don't think that's an option for me.

How much does the university from which you get your engineering degree from matter? I am a bit worried I will only get into mediocre programs. 

Has anyone had similar experiences?

How is the space industry as a mechanical engineer (as of now, most interested field) or in general?

I am programming a vehicle simulation at the moment and i have trouble combining the torque and the slip ratio.

The longitudinal force a tire creates is a [function of the slip ratio](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAMyu.gif). A tire produces the most amount of force at about 0.06 slip ratio. When i apply a torque on a wheel the slip ratio will increase and produce a longitudinal force.

I use the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ratio) definition of slip ratio. I am aware that this definition is unstable at low speeds and even undefined at velocity of zero but i dont think this is a problem with my question.

**Here is my question:**  
What is the slip ratio if i apply a torque T to the tire? 

**Here is why i am confused:**  
My approach is to just accelerate the tire as if there are no other forces. This will increase the angular velocity and now i can calculate the slip ratio. But i dont think this really works. Here is an example.  

Here are the relevent values of my tire:  
inertia I=1.  
radius r=0.5m.  
velocity of the axle v=10m/s.  
angular velocity omega=20rad/s.  
torque T = 1000Nm.


I can apply the torque on the wheel first and then calculate the new slip ratio. If i do this the tire will accelerate by T/I -&gt; 1000/1 -&gt; 1000rad/s/s. So after, for example, one second the new Angular velocity is omega = 1200rad/s!!.

Now my slip ratio is omega\*r/v - 1 -&gt; 1200\*0.5 / 10 - 1 -&gt; 59. 

If i set my timestep to 100ms i get.  
omega = 120rad/s.  
slip ratio = 5.

if i set m timestep to 10ms i get.  
omega = 21rad/s.  
slip ratio = 0.05.

I feel like calculating my slip ratio should not be dependent on timestep. At most it should be more precise as the timestep becomes smaller but it should not be linearly dependent on it.

So how can i calculate the slip ratio in a way that is NOT dependent on timestep?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. I am programming a vehicle simulation at the moment and i have trouble combining the torque and the slip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

**Brands:**

Most standard brands available today are Rheem, Trane, American Standard, Carrier, Bryant, Lennox, York, Amana and Goodman. Other Brands such as Maytag, Frigidaire and Tappan which are manufactured by Nordyne. Non standard brands such as Florida Heat Pump (FHP), First Company and Mitsubishi.

**Sizing:**

It is very important that you purchase the correct size system for your home regardless of the size you currently have. What I mean by that is, don’t just replace with the same thing you have now. It could be mis-sized and causing you problems that you are not aware of such as short cycling (causing humidity problems) or over working (shortening its life span).

Today’s systems are different in design then your older system. In order to achieve the higher efficiencies, they have installed a TXV valve which regulates the flow of the refrigerant. These keep the units from working inefficiently but do not allow for deficiencies in sizing.

The best way to properly size your new system is to have your contractor do a Heat Load Calculation also known as a Manual J. If not, as a general rule of thumb, 500 sq. ft. per ton of a/c living space for a single family home (example 2000 sq. ft. of a/c living space is a safe bet at 4 tons) . Factors may vary depending on exposure of home, how many windows and type, attached or free standing home, single story or 2, inadequate insulation in attic and leaking ductwork.

Your contractor should also check your ductwork in the attic to make sure it’s sized properly for the new system. Don’t assume or let him tell you it’s fine if he hasn’t looked (red flag).

**Seer Rating:**

Acronym for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. The higher the SEER rating the lower your electric bill. Some utility companies offer rebates based on the SEER rating. 13 SEER is the minimum rating allowed by law and can go up to 21 SEER or higher depending on the brand. Keep in mind that the higher the SEER the more costly the equipment. For a single stage unit (I will explain about this later on) 16 seer is about the highest and probably the most popular now because of price.

**Types of Central a/c systems:**

Split systems, package units and water source heat pumps (less common and usually in high rise condos). A split system has 2 units, a condenser outside and an air handler inside. A package unit has both in 1 on the outside. A water cooled unit has both inside and is connected to a water source.

**Single Stage vs. 2 Stage:**

Single stage system is the least expensive and the more common system. It uses one compressor in the outside unit (condenser). A 2 stage system has either 1 compressor that changes speeds or 2 compressors that change back and forth according to demand. A 2 stage unit also has a variable speed air handler. The benefit to the 2 stage system is better humidity control, better air circulation and quieter operation.This system will keep your home feeling more comfortable over the course of a day because it adjusts to the changing environment of your home. Factors such as outside temperature, direction of the sun as it relates to your home and humidity will be compensated by this system.Also check your old thermostat.You might have to replace it and [get a new one preferably programmable type](http://thermostatonline.com/) that support your system.

**Types of Heating:**

Heat strip, heat pump, gas furnace. A heat strip is a coil in the air handler that heats up like a toaster. The air blows over it as it goes through the air handler. A heat pump uses a reverse cycle on the compressor to produce heat and can be supplemented with a heat strip for additional heating (used in cooler climates). A gas furnace gets its heat from natural gas and is used in colder climates.

**Refrigerant Line Sizing:**

These are the the copper pipes that carry the refrigerant (or freon) back and forth from the condenser to the air handler. There are 2 lines. A liquid line and a suction line. They must be the correct size according to the manufacturers specifications. Make sure that your contractor checks them to see if you have the right size for the new unit. Don’t assume they are correct even if you are replacing with the same size a/c. They may never have been correct. Under sized lines cause premature failure of the equipment due to low lubrication of the compressor and will lower the SEER rating that you are paying for. If a contractor does not check these (red flag).

**Rule of thumb.**

1.5 to 2.5 tons minimum size is 5/8 and 1/4 up to a 50′ run.

3 to 3.5 tons minimum size is 3/4 and 3/8

4 to 5 tons minimum size 7/8 and 3/8

**Electrical Specifications:**

Electrical wiring also needs to be sized properly. Don’t assume because you lived in your home for 20 years and your a/c has worked fine and you’ve never had a fire that it’s ok. Breakers also need to be sized properly. Again, don’t assume that what you have is right or safe. Make sure your contractor checks this without you asking. if not (red flag). Rule of thumb for air handlers

up to 30 amp breaker #10 wire and you can use a 5 kw heater

up to 45 amp breaker #8 wire and you can use a 8 kw heater

up to 60 amp breaker #6 wire and you can use a 10 kw heater

Rule of thumb for condensers

Varies by size and brand but wire sizes and breakers listed above are the same.

**Manufacturers, Utilities and Government Rebates:**

Manufacturers have rebates usually in the spring and the fall. The higher the price of the equipment, the higher the rebates (typically up to $1200). Keep in mind that the dealer absorbs half the cost of the rebate, so it gets built into the price to the consumer. Here is a link for state, local and/or utility incentives in your area [http://www.dsireusa.org/](http://www.dsireusa.org/). Power utilities may also have rebates for repairing ductwork and replacing insulation in the attic. Federal Energy tax credits ended on December 31, 2011 but legislation is in congress for new tax credits.

**Hiring a Contractor:**

Your local power utility company may have a list of participating contractors for any utility rebates. Better Business Bureau is good if you take the time and check how many complaints a particular contractor has (too many and red flag). Angie’s list is also good. The best way to find a contractor is by word of mouth. Ask your neighbors, friends and co-workers. If they’ve had a good experience, they will surely let you know, if not then you know which contractors to stay away from. Get 3 estimates. If you do your research and call reputable contractors, then 3 should be enough. Too many will definitely get you confused. Make sure that they leave you a written estimate with all work to be done as well as model numbers and prices. If all these things are not on the proposal or if they tell you that they don’t pull permits for the job then beware. Most cities require permits even if your replacing with the same thing. This is to make sure that your contractor did all the work according to code and that your home is safe.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brands:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most standard brands available today are Rheem, Trane, American Standard, Carrier, Bryant, Lennox, York, Amana and Goodman. Other Brands such as Maytag, Frigidaire and Tappan which are manufactured by Nordyne. Non standard brands such as Florida Heat Pump (FHP), First Company and Mitsubishi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sizing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you purchase the correct size system for your home regardless of the size you currently have. What I mean by that is, don’t just replace with the same thing you have now. It could be mis-sized and causing you problems that you are not aware of such as short cycling (causing humidity problems) or over working (shortening its life span).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s systems are different in design then your older system. In order to achieve the higher efficiencies, they have installed a TXV valve which regulates the flow of the refrigerant. These keep the units from working inefficiently but do not allow for deficiencies in sizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to properly size your new system is to have your contractor do a Heat Load Calculation also known as a Manual J. If not, as a general rule of thumb, 500 sq. ft. per ton of a/c living space for a single family home (example 2000 sq. ft. of a/c living space is a safe bet at 4 tons) .

While I’ve learned a lot from shadowing engineers and field crews in my spare time, I still find myself lacking some pretty basic knowledge. The extent of my formal schooling in electricity is my high school science class, a basic electricity and magnetism class in undergrad (largely forgotten), and a circuits class I took in graduate school on a whim. Ive been able to piece together a good deal of how everything works, but I haven’t had a cohesive education on power systems; everything has come piecemeal from different sources.

To better round out my resume and experience, management suggested I take a field centric role as an operations supervisor. Even though I’m a finance guy, I’ve decided to go for the opportunity, and training will be provided. I find the operations side fascinating and am eager to learn. Having said that, I feel like I have a lot of ground to cover and want to get a more formal understanding of things. I feel completely unprepared for the role.

Since this company offers full tuition reimbursement, I brought up the idea of going back to school part time to get a degree in electrical engineering, but management told me that it wouldn’t really be worthwhile or necessary. According to them, a formal electrical engineering education is too theoretical and won’t give the kind of operational knowledge that they want me to obtain. Furthermore, it’s not like I would ever be an engineer or designer. This move is intended to give me operational experience, and then after a few years I’d probably go back to the corporate strategy side of things.

In shadowing engineers or our union workforce, I get tons of great information, but I don’t always understand the “why” behind things, which is infuriating. So basically, I’m hoping you guys could please recommend a few books that could supplement my learning. I don’t mind technical or math heavy books, but please keep in mind that i don’t need super abstract design or engineering knowledge. I’m thinking more along the lines of basic concepts, and an overview of the different types of grid equipment, distribution systems, so I can be conversant and familiar with the different issues faced by our teams.

&lt;p&gt;In shadowing engineers or our union workforce, I get tons of great information, but I don’t always understand the “why” behind things, which is infuriating. So basically, I’m hoping you guys could please recommend a few books that could supplement my learning. I don’t mind technical or math heavy books, but please keep in mind that i don’t need super abstract design or engineering knowledge. I’m thinking more along the lines of basic concepts, and an overview of the different types of grid equipment, distribution systems, so I can be conversant and familiar with the different issues faced by our teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like it would be of most value for me to ask the engineers of reddit about the current situation I’m in, because honestly I can’t tell what to make of it. 

First I guess some background information on myself. I am a Civil Engineer who recently graduated. I have been working at a private firm for 5 months now that does a lot of commercial and industrial site design work. I’ve also had 4 years of internship experience at other places before this. 

The issue I’m having is that this job is causing me so much stress and anxiety to the point where mental breakdowns are almost a daily occurrence. I know stress is normal and to be expected in any field, but this just doesn’t seem right. 

I’m really going to attempt to be as objective as possible here, so here’s just some general concerns I have. 

-Literally no training time. In my interview I stated I had very limited experience with CAD. First day I was asked to draft up a plan set due by the end of that week. All my CAD knowledge to this point has basically been learned through trial and error. 

-Often times when I do CAD work for my PM, and he isn’t satisfied, or if it’s taking too long, he will just give it to someone else (says I’m wasting the clients money). I can’t recall one experience where I’ve sat down with him and went over things I did wrong. 

-11-12 hour days (6:30am-5:30pm)  are common for me. I’m not trying to kiss ass or anything by working so long, I literally feel like I have to in order to get anything out on time. 

I could go on, but i don’t want this post to be 10 times longer than it already is. I’m more or less trying to give a general idea of the situation rather than listing out negative experiences. 



I guess my question is what is a typical work load for an engineer who’s just getting started? What expectations did PMs seem to have of you? Is there a certain pace that is common or ideal for new engineers? And does this sound like an unhealthy work environment, or am I just having trouble adjusting to it?

* What exactly is the ""climate change""? (what is the physics and the chemistry behind it)
* What molecules are the worst and why? Is it just CO2 and/or NOx?

* At what point in history did climate change become a topic?
* What are the consequences?

Since we're in the early design phase, and since I'm having him keep to a budget (the project was his idea, but I'm using it as a platform for teaching some basic engineering practices), we don't want to buy full-scale motors or props until we are reasonably sure that the concept is even potentially feasible.

&lt;p&gt;What is the typical day for an aerospace engineer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What projects have you worked on that have been particularly interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the career relate to any experiences or studies in college?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What courses would you recommend for me to take to gain a full understanding or learn more for my career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any additional advice you’d like to share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

But what about the angle of wrap?  Intuitively, pulling the rope around a full 180° turn should cause far higher stress than bending it only 20° or so.  Yet I haven't found any way to quantify this.  The rope guidelines I've seen imply that turning your rope even 1° is just as damaging as turning it 180°, as long as the bending radius is the same.

Does anyone have experience with this?
